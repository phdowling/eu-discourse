The proposal builds on\r\nexisting international due diligence frameworks and principles.\nGeneral\r\ncontext\nToday, international measures exist to\r\npromote responsible sourcing of minerals in areas at risk or affected by armed\r\nconflict. The two best-known were adopted in 2011 and 2010 respectively: the OECD\r\nDue Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from\r\nConflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas (OECD Due Diligence Guidance) and\r\nSection 1502 of the United States Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer\r\nProtection Act.\nThe former is not country or\r\nregion-specific and sets out a process to be followed by countries interested\r\nin developing responsible sourcing capabilities. While primarily at the\r\ndisposal of companies in OECD jurisdictions, the Due Diligence Guidance is also\r\na source of inspiration attracting the participation of companies performing\r\nsignificant transformative or trading functions in mineral supply chains for\r\ngold, tin, tantalum and tungsten. In 2011, the EU took a political commitment\r\nin the OECD framework to support the further uptake of the Guidance.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act focuses on the\r\nDemocratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and nine adjoining countries. Section 1502\r\nof the Act requires companies listed on US stock exchanges which use 'conflict\r\nminerals'[2]\r\nto report to the Security Exchange Commission on the origin of such minerals\r\nand on relevant due diligence measures. These reports require an extensive\r\nsupply chain inquiry. US-listed companies are turning increasingly to their\r\nsuppliers, including in the EU, for relevant information and evidence of due\r\ndiligence. One of the business responses to the Act has been to redirect trade\r\naway from Central Africa with impacts on the local markets for gold, tin,\r\ntantalum and tungsten. Legitimately mined minerals make it to US and EU markets\r\nwith some difficulty.\nThe trade of conflict minerals is very well\r\ndocumented in the case of the DRC and is the subject of UN Security Council\r\nResolution 1952 (2010). However, other cases abound elsewhere in Africa, Asia\r\nand Latin America and the cause is being taken up outside the OECD too. In June\r\n2013, G8 leaders expressed their commitment[3]\r\nto increase transparency in the extractive industry.\nAgainst this background, the European\r\nCommission and the High Representative have been working to develop a\r\ncomprehensive EU responsible mineral sourcing framework. This work follows up a\r\n2010 European Parliament Resolution calling for the EU to legislate along the\r\nlines of US legislation as well as two Communications in 2011 and 2012[4] that announced the\r\nCommission's intention to explore ways of improving supply chain transparency.\r\nThis legislative proposal will therefore be accompanied by a Communication\r\ndetailing other policy measures that can be deployed to tackle the problem as\r\nbroadly as possible.\nExisting\r\nprovisions in the area of the proposal\nExisting EU initiatives in relation to\r\nnatural resources, financial transparency and conflict-sensitive management of\r\ninternational diamond trade and forestry:\n\u2013                        \r\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 2368/2002 of 20\r\nDecember 2002 implementing the Kimberley Process certification scheme for the\r\ninternational trade in rough diamonds\n\u2013                        \r\nRegulation (EU) No 995/2010 of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council of 20 October 2010 laying down the obligations of\r\noperators who place timber and timber products on the market. \n\u2013                        \r\nDirective 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament\r\nand the Council of 26 June 2013 on the annual financial statements,\r\nconsolidated financial statements and related reports of certain types of\r\nundertakings, amending Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and the Council\r\nand repealing Council Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC.\nConsistency\r\nwith the other policies and objectives of the Union\nThe proposal is\r\nconsistent with, and aims at contributing to the EU foreign policy goals and\r\ndevelopment strategy of better governance, sustainable management and law\r\nenforcement in relation to the exploitation of natural resources in\r\nmineral-producing conflict-affected and high-risk areas as well as to EU\r\nenterprises and corporate social responsibility policies, which recommend companies\r\nto mitigate any potential negative impacts that they might have on society, and\r\ntherefore pay attention to any potential human rights violations. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nConsultation\r\nof interested parties\nA broad consultation process was held between\r\nDecember 2012 and June 2013 which included a web-based public consultation and\r\nnumerous meetings with stakeholders. An assessment study into due diligence\r\ncompliance costs, benefits and related effects on selected operators in\r\nrelation to the responsible sourcing of minerals was finalised mid-September\r\n2013. \nA summary of the results of the public\r\nconsultation and the final report of the assessment study are made available on\r\nthe Commission's web-site concurrently with this proposal.\nThe Commission carried out an impact\r\nassessment of the proposed policy options taking into account the results of\r\nthe public consultation and the assessment study, which led to the publication\r\nof a report. The following six options were considered:\n\u00b7        \r\nOption 1 \u2013 Standalone EU Communication \nThis option consists of the following measures\r\nto be included in a joint Communication of the Commission and the High Representative:\r\n(i) National Contact Points (NCPs) and the Enterprise Europe Network (EEN)\r\nwould advocate the uptake of the OECD Due Diligence Guidance; (ii) EU public\r\nprocurement: the application of performance clauses in Commission and EU Member\r\nStates' public procurement contracts for relevant products (e.g. computers,\r\ncell phones); (iii) financial assistance to the existing OECD programmes; (iv)\r\nCommission support to 'Letters of Intent' by the European industry, and (v) government-to-government\r\nactions.\n\u00b7        \r\nOption 2 \u2013 'Soft-law' approach\nThis option combines the measures described\r\nunder Option 1 with a Council Recommendation to raise awareness of and promote\r\nthe voluntary uptake by EU enterprises of the OECD Due Diligence Guidance\r\nnotably for those enterprises that are not already subject to a mandatory third\r\ncountry scheme.\n\u00b7        \r\nOption 3 - Regulation establishing obligations\r\nunder an 'EU Responsible Importer' certification based on the OECD Due\r\nDiligence Guidance - VOLUNTARY\nThis option combines the measures described\r\nunder Option 1, with a Regulation targeting all EU importers of tin, tantalum and\r\ntungsten ores and metals, and gold, regardless of the origin of the products.\r\nThe Regulation relies on the OECD Due Diligence Guidance to define obligations\r\nfor EU importers that opt to be self-certified as responsible importers of tin,\r\ntantalum and tungsten ores and metals, and gold, on the basis of a\r\nself-declaration of compliance. \nAlthough the Regulation is voluntary, EU\r\nimporters opting for self-certification are obliged to integrate all elements\r\nof the OECD Due Diligence Guidance in their management system by: (i)\r\nmaintaining a system of controls and transparency over the mineral supply\r\nchain, which includes inter alia the country of mineral origin and the\r\nsmelters/refiners; (ii) identifying and assessing risks in the supply chain\r\nagainst the OECD model supply chain policy; (iii) designing and implementing a\r\nstrategy to respond to identified risks; (iv) obtaining independent third-party\r\naudit assurances of supply chain due diligence; and (v) reporting publicly on\r\nsupply chain due diligence.\nThe EU self-certified importer is required\r\nto disclose annually to the Member State competent authority the identity and\r\ngeographical location of the smelters/refiners in its supply chain. On this\r\nbasis, an EU list of responsible smelters/refiners established in or supplying\r\nto the EU, would be drawn up.\nThe scheme will be evaluated after three\r\nyears, or before in case available information will allow it, and the results\r\nwill be used for decision-making needs on the future of the EU approach and for\r\namendments to the regulatory framework, making it mandatory, if appropriate, on\r\nthe basis of a further impact assessment. \n\u00b7        \r\nOption 4 - Regulation establishing obligations\r\nunder an 'EU responsible importer' certification based on the OECD Due\r\nDiligence Guidance \u2013 MANDATORY\nThis option combines the measures described\r\nunder Option 1, with a compulsory version of the Regulation described in Option\r\n3 under which all EU importers of tin, tantalum and tungsten ores and metals,\r\nand gold, would be subject to the obligations defined under the Regulation.\n\u00b7        \r\nOption 5 - Directive establishing obligations\r\nfor EU-listed companies based on the OECD Due Diligence Guidance\nThis option combines the measures described\r\nunder Option 1, with a Directive targeting almost 1,000 EU-listed companies\r\nusing tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold, regardless of origin, in their supply\r\nchain.\nThe Directive would define the obligations\r\nfor EU-listed companies to integrate OECD Due Diligence Guidance in their\r\nmanagement system by (i) maintaining a system of controls and transparency over\r\nthe mineral supply chain, which includes inter alia the country of\r\nmineral origin and the smelters/refiners; (ii) identifying and assessing risks\r\nin the supply chain against the OECD model supply chain policy; (iii) designing\r\nand implementing a strategy to respond to identified risks; (iv) obtaining an\r\nindependent third-party audit of supply chain due diligence of the EU-listed\r\ncompany; and (v) reporting publicly on supply chain due diligence.\nEU-listed companies should disclose to\r\nMember States' competent authorities the outcome of the independent third-party\r\naudit.\n\u00b7        \r\nOption 6 - Prohibition of imports when EU\r\nimporters of mineral ores fail to demonstrate compliance with OECD Due\r\nDiligence Guidance \nThis option consists of the measures\r\ndescribed under Option 1, and in addition it would require EU importers to\r\nmandatorily demonstrate compliance with the OECD Due Diligence Guidance. Providing\r\nevidence on compliance to Member States' customs authorities, importers will be\r\neligible to access the EU market.\nThis option would follow the approach taken\r\nby the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme targeting the trade in rough\r\ndiamonds and Council Regulation (EC) No 2368/2002 of 20 December 2002 based on\r\nArticle 133 EC (now Article 207 TFEU) which sets out the rules applicable for\r\nimports and exports of rough diamonds. In this case, an international agreement\r\nsupports the importation ban for so-called \"conflict diamonds\". \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nSummary of the\r\nproposed action\nThe proposed action is Option 3. It focuses\r\non all EU operators importing tin, tantalum and tungsten, their ores, and gold into\r\nthe EU market. It defines the conditions for them to be self-certified as\r\nresponsible importers of the mineral and metals in scope. The proposal is based\r\non a due diligence framework allowing EU importers to apply the principles and\r\nprocesses set out in the OECD Due Diligence Guidance and thereby addressing the\r\nrisk of financing armed groups and security forces and mitigating other adverse\r\nimpacts including serious abuses associated with the extraction, transport or\r\ntrade of the minerals in scope. \nThe due diligence framework requires responsible\r\nimporters of the mineral and metal within the scope of the Regulation to establish\r\na strong company management system; to identify and assess risks in the supply\r\nchain; to design and implement a strategy to respond to identified risks; to carry\r\nout independent third-party audits of supply chain due diligence at identified\r\npoints in the supply chain; and to report on supply chain due diligence. \nIn addition, responsible importers of those\r\nminerals and metals are required to make available on an annual basis, where\r\napplicable, the identity of all smelters and/or refiners supplying them, as\r\nwell as to provide independent third-party audit assurances and pass them on to\r\nMember States' competent authorities and to downstream purchasers, with due\r\nregard to business confidentiality and other competitive concerns. \nThe proposal aims to help reduce the\r\nfinancing of armed groups and security forces through mineral proceeds in\r\nconflict-affected and high-risk areas by encouraging EU operators importing the\r\nminerals and metals within the scope of the Regulation from such areas, to do\r\nso responsibly and facilitate due diligence efforts of downstream purchasers.\nOn the basis of the information disclosed\r\nto the competent authorities, the EU will publish annually, after consultation with\r\nthe OECD, a list of responsible smelters and refiners that source according to the\r\nRegulation. \nLegal basis \nArticle 207 of the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union.\nThe principles\r\nof subsidiarity and proportionality \nThe proposal falls under the exclusive\r\ncompetence of the Union. The subsidiarity principle does therefore not apply.\r\nIt should however be noted that in the light of the problems outlined above,\r\nEU-level action provides more critical mass and global leverage relative to individual\r\nMember State action. \nThe principle of proportionality requires\r\nthat any intervention is targeted and does not go beyond what is necessary to\r\nachieve the objectives. This principle has guided the preparation of this\r\nproposal from the identification and evaluation of alternative policy options\r\nto the drafting of the legislative proposal.\nChoice of the\r\ninstrument\nThe proposed instrument is a Regulation to\r\nensure the highest level of harmonisation across Member States and guarantee\r\nsufficient authority over participating operators and leverage in relation to\r\nthe identification of smelters and refiners. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe present proposal entails limited\r\nfinancial implications for the Union budget for administrative purposes.\n2014/0059 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\nsetting up a Union system for supply chain\r\ndue diligence self-certification of responsible importers of tin, tantalum and\r\ntungsten, their ores, and gold originating in conflict-affected and high-risk\r\nareas \nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Natural mineral resources in\r\nconflict-affected or high risk areas \u2212 although holding great potential\r\nfor development \u2013 can be a cause of dispute where their revenues are fuelling the\r\noutbreak or continuation of violent conflict, undermining national endeavours\r\ntowards development, good governance and the rule of law. In these areas,\r\nbreaking the nexus between conflict and illegal exploitation of minerals is\r\ncritical to peace and stability. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The issue concerns\r\nresource-rich regions where the challenge posed by the desire to minimise the\r\nfinancing of armed groups and security forces has been taken up by governments\r\nand international organisations together with business operators and civil\r\nsociety organisations. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union has been\r\nactively engaged in an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)\r\ninitiative to advance the responsible sourcing of minerals from conflict\r\nregions, which has resulted in a government-backed multi-stakeholder process\r\nleading to the adoption of the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible\r\nSupply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas (OECD\r\nDue Diligence Guidance[5])\r\nincluding supplements on tin, tantalum and tungsten, and on gold. In May 2011,\r\nthe OECD Ministerial Council recommended to actively promote the observance of\r\nthis Guidance. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The concept of responsible\r\nsourcing is referred to in the updated OECD Guidelines for Multinational\r\nEnterprises[6]\r\nand is in line with the United Nations (UN) Guiding Principles on Business and\r\nHuman Rights[7].\r\nThese documents aim at advancing supply chain due diligence practices when\r\nbusinesses source from regions affected by conflict and instability. At the\r\nhighest international level, UN Security Council Resolution 1952 (2010)\r\nspecifically targeted the Democratic Republic of Congo (the DRC) and its\r\nneighbours in Central Africa calling for supply chain due diligence to be\r\nobserved; the UN Group of Experts on the DRC, following up Security Council Resolution\r\n1952 (2010), also advocates compliance with the OECD Due Diligence Guidance. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition to\r\nmultilateral initiatives, on 15 December 2010, the Heads of State and\r\nGovernment of the Great Lakes Region took a political commitment in Lusaka to fight the illegal exploitation of natural resources in the region and approved inter\r\nalia a regional certification mechanism based on the OECD Due Diligence\r\nGuidance.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission in its 2008\r\nCommunication[8]\r\nrecognised that securing reliable and undistorted access to raw materials is an\r\nimportant factor for the EU's competitiveness. The Raw Materials Initiative\r\n(RMI) is an integrated strategy aimed at responding to different challenges\r\nrelated to access to non-energy non-agriculture raw materials. The RMI\r\nrecognises and promotes financial as well as supply chain transparency, and the\r\napplication of corporate social responsibility standards.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 7 October 2010, the\r\nEuropean Parliament passed a Resolution calling for the Union to legislate along\r\nthe lines of the US 'conflict minerals' law alias Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank\r\nWall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; and the Commission\r\nannounced in its Communications of 2011[9]\r\nand 2012[10] its intention to explore ways of improving\r\ntransparency throughout the supply chain, including aspects of due diligence. In\r\nthe latter communication and in line with the commitment it had made at the May\r\n2011 OECD Ministerial Council, the Commission also advocated greater support\r\nfor and use of the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, and of the OECD\r\nDue Diligence Guidance \u2013 even outside the OECD membership. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union citizens and civil\r\nsociety actors have raised awareness with respect to companies operating under the\r\n Union's jurisdiction for not being held accountable for their potential connection\r\nto the illicit extraction and trade of minerals from conflict regions. The consequence\r\nis that such minerals, potentially present in consumer products, link consumers\r\nto conflicts outside the Union. To this end, citizens have requested, notably through\r\npetitions, that legislation be proposed to the European Parliament and the\r\nCouncil holding companies accountable under the Guidelines as established by\r\nthe UN and OECD.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the context of this\r\nRegulation, supply chain due diligence is an on-going, proactive and reactive\r\nprocess through which business operators monitor and administer their purchases\r\nand sales with a view to ensuring that they do not contribute to conflict and\r\nadverse impacts thereof.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Third-party auditing of a company's\r\nsupply chain due diligence practices ensures credibility for the benefit of downstream\r\ncompanies and contributes to the improvement of the upstream due diligence\r\npractices.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Public reporting by a\r\ncompany on its supply chain due diligence policies and practices provides the\r\nnecessary transparency to generate public confidence in the measures companies\r\nare taking. \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union companies have\r\nexpressed their interest through the public consultation in the responsible\r\nsourcing of minerals and reported on current industry schemes designed to\r\npursue their corporate social responsibility objectives, customer requests, or\r\nthe security of their supplies. However, Union companies have also reported countless\r\ndifficulties in the exercise of supply chain due diligence because of lengthy\r\nand complex global supply chains involving a high number of operators that are\r\noften insufficiently aware or ethically unconcerned. The cost of responsible\r\nsourcing and their potential impact on competitiveness notably on SMEs should\r\nbe monitored by the Commission.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Smelters and refiners are\r\nan important point in global mineral supply chains as they are typically the last\r\nstage in which due diligence can effectively be assured by collecting, disclosing\r\nand verifying information on the mineral's origin and chain of custody. After\r\nthis stage of transformation it is often considered unfeasible to trace back the\r\norigins of minerals. A Union list of responsible smelters and refiners could\r\ntherefore provide transparency and certainty to downstream companies as regards\r\nsupply chain due diligence practices.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Member State competent authorities are responsible to ensure the uniform compliance of the self-certification\r\nof responsible importers by carrying out appropriate ex-post checks so as to\r\nverify whether the self-certified responsible importers of the minerals and/or\r\nmetals within the scope of the Regulation comply with the supply chain due\r\ndiligence obligations. Records of such checks should be kept for at least 5\r\nyears. Member States are responsible to lay down the rules applicable to\r\ninfringements of the provisions of this Regulation.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure the proper\r\nimplementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on\r\nthe Commission. The implementing powers relating to the list of responsible\r\nsmelters and refiners and the list of Member State competent authorities should\r\nbe exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011[11]. \n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission should report\r\nregularly to the Council and the European Parliament on the effects of the\r\nscheme.
