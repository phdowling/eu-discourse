In each meeting session new amendments to\r\nexisting UN Regulations or Global Technical Regulations are adopted in order to\r\nallow for technical progress. Prior to each WP29 meeting these amendments were\r\nadopted by one of the six working groups (GRs) that are active under WP29.\nSubsequently, in a WP29 meeting the final\r\nvote for adoption of the amendments, supplements and corrigenda takes place,\r\nprovided the quorum is reached and there is a qualified majority among\r\ncontracting parties. The EU is a contracting party to two Agreements (1958 and\r\n1998 Agreements) under WP29 and votes on behalf of the Member States. A Council\r\nDecision, referred to as \"mega decision\", containing the list of\r\namendments, supplements and corrigenda, is prepared each time and authorises\r\nthe Commission to vote on behalf of the Member States in each WP29 meeting.\nThis Council Decision defines the Union's\r\nposition in the voting of the amendments, supplements and corrigenda submitted\r\nfor vote in the June 2014 WP29 meeting that will take place on 24 to 27 June 2014.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe Technical Committee Motor Vehicles has\r\nbeen consulted and the comments from Member State experts have been taken into\r\naccount.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\n\u00b7                        \r\nSummary of the proposed action\nThe\r\nproposal defines the Union's position in the voting of the amendments to UN\r\nRegulations Nos 13, 13H, 14, 29, 44, 49, 51, 54, 75, 83, 90, 101, 106, 121,\r\n127, the UN Regulation on Retrofit Emissions Control (REC) devices for heavy\r\nduty vehicles, and the Consolidated Resolution on the Construction of Vehicles\r\n(R.E.3).\n\u00b7                        \r\nLegal basis\nThe legal basis for this proposal is Article\r\n114, in conjunction with Article 218(9) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the\r\nEuropean Union.\n\u00b7                        \r\nSubsidiarity principle\nThe vote in favour of international\r\ninstruments like proposals for amendments to UN Regulations and draft Global\r\nTechnical Regulations and their incorporation into the Union system for the\r\ntype-approval of motor vehicles can only be done by the Union. This does not\r\nonly prevent fragmentation of the Internal Market, but also ensures equal\r\nhealth and safety standards across the Union. It also offers advantages of\r\neconomies of scale: products can be made for the entire Union market and even\r\nthe international market, instead of being customised to obtain national\r\ntype-approval for every single Member State.\nThis proposal therefore complies with the\r\nsubsidiarity principle.\n\u00b7                        \r\nProportionality principle\nThis proposal complies with the\r\nproportionality principle as it does not go beyond what is necessary in order\r\nto achieve the objectives of ensuring the proper functioning of the Internal\r\nMarket, while at the same time providing for a high level of public safety and\r\nprotection.\n\u00b7                        \r\nChoice of instruments\nThe use of a Council Decision is required\r\nby Article 218(9) TFEU in order to establish the positions to be adopted on the\r\nUnion\u2019s behalf in a body set up by an international agreement.\n2014/0162 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nestablishing the position to be adopted on\r\nthe Union's behalf in the relevant Committees of the United Nations Economic\r\nCommission for Europe as regards the proposals for amendments to UN Regulations\r\nNos 13, 13H, 14, 29, 44, 49, 51, 54, 75, 83, 90, 101, 106, 121, 127, the UN\r\nRegulation on Retrofit Emission Control (REC) devices for heavy duty vehicles\r\nand the UN Consolidated Resolution on the Construction of Vehicles (R.E.3)\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114, in\r\nconjunction with Article 218(9) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Council Decision 97/836/EC[3], the Union acceded to\r\nthe Agreement of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE)\r\nconcerning the adoption of uniform technical prescriptions for wheeled\r\nvehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted to and/or be used on wheeled\r\nvehicles and the conditions for reciprocal recognition of approvals granted on\r\nthe basis of these prescriptions (\u2018Revised 1958 Agreement\u2019).\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Council Decision 2000/125/EC[4], the Union acceded to\r\nthe Agreement concerning the establishing of global technical regulations for\r\nwheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted and/or be used on\r\nwheeled vehicles (\u2018Parallel Agreement\u2019).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the\r\nCouncil[5]\r\nreplaced the approval systems of the Member States with a Union approval\r\nprocedure and established a harmonised framework containing administrative\r\nprovisions and general technical requirements for all new vehicles, systems,\r\ncomponents and separate technical units. That Directive incorporated UN\r\nregulations in the EU type-approval system, either as requirements for\r\ntype-approval or as alternatives to Union legislation. Since the adoption of that\r\nDirective, UN regulations have increasingly replaced Union legislation in the\r\nframework of the EU type-approval.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the light of experience and technical developments, the\r\nrequirements relating to certain elements or features covered by UN Regulations\r\nNos 13, 13H, 14, 29, 44, 49, 51, 54, 75, 83, 90, 101, 106, 121, 127, the UN\r\nRegulation on Retrofit Emission Control (REC) devices for heavy duty vehicles\r\nand the UN Consolidated Resolution on the Construction of Vehicles (R.E.3) need\r\nto be adapted.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is therefore necessary to establish the position to be adopted\r\non the Union's behalf in the Administrative Committee of the Revised 1958\r\nAgreement and in the Executive Committee of the Parallel Agreement, as regards the\r\nadoption of those UN acts,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nSole Article\nThe position to be adopted on the Union's behalf\r\nin the Administrative Committee of the Revised 1958 Agreement and in the\r\nExecutive Committee of the Parallel Agreement on 24 to 27\r\nJune 2014 shall be to vote in favour of the
