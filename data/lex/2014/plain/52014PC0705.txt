ETQG consists of delegations from all Member States plus Turkey. It met three times before the changes laid down in this proposal have been agreed.\nEach request (new, amended or rolled-over\r\nrequests) has been assessed carefully by the group. In particular, preventing\r\nany harm for EU producers, the strengthening and consolidation of the\r\ncompetiveness of EU production and the creation or maintenance of employment\r\nare part of the examination of each case. This assessment has been carried out\r\nby discussions within the group and consultation by Member States of the\r\nconcerned industries, associations, chambres of commerce and other stakeholders\r\ninvolved.\nThis proposal concerns a number of\r\nagricultural and industrial products. The suspension requests were examined in\r\nthe light of the criteria set out in the Communication from the Commission\r\nconcerning autonomous tariff suspensions and quotas (OJ C 363, 13.12.2011, p.\r\n6). Following this review, the Commission considers that the suspension of\r\nduties is justified for the products listed in Annex I of this proposal. Also,\r\nAnnex I lists i) products for which the wording of their description had to be\r\nchanged, ii) products for which a new CN or TARIC code became necessary or iii)\r\nproducts which were reviewed and for which a new date for mandatory review was\r\nset.\nProducts for which tariff suspension is no\r\nlonger in the Union's economic interests have to be withdrawn. Accordingly,\r\nAnnex II lists the products removed from the Annex I to Regulation (EU) No\r\n1387/2013 and products for which the wording of their description had to be\r\nchanged, products for which a new CN or TARIC code became necessary or products\r\nfor which a new date for mandatory review was set, which are replaced by new\r\ndescription, codes and/or date in Annex I.\nThe list of relevant supplementary units in\r\nthe Annex II to Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013 should be updated. Thus, Annex III\r\ncontains the list of codes of the supplementary units of the products listed in\r\nAnnex I of this proposal and Annex IV of the attached proposal lists codes of\r\nthe supplementary units of the products removed from the Annex I of the above\r\nmentioned Regulation.\nThe proposal is in line with the trade,\r\nenterprise, development and external relations policies.\nParticularly, this proposal is not at the\r\nexpense of countries enjoying a preferential trading agreement with the EU\r\n(e.g. GSP, ACP regime, candidate countries and potential candidates).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe ETQG, in which the competent\r\nauthorities of all Member State are represented, was consulted. All listed\r\nsuspensions correspond to agreements or compromises reached in the discussions\r\nof the group.\nThere was no mention of potentially serious\r\nrisks with irreversible consequences.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe legal basis of this regulation proposal\r\nis Article 31 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).\nBy virtue of Article 31 of the TFEU\r\nautonomous tariff suspensions and quotas are fixed by the Council acting on\r\nqualified majority on the basis of a Commission proposal, therefore a\r\nregulation is the appropriate instrument.\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive\r\ncompetence of the Union. The subsidiary principle therefore does not apply.\nThe proposal complies with the principle of\r\nproportionality as this set of measures is in line with the principles set out\r\nto simplify the procedures for the operators engaged in foreign trade and in\r\naccordance with the Commission communication concerning autonomous tariff suspensions\r\nand quotas (C 363, 13.12.2011 p.6).\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nUncollected customs duties of a total\r\namount of approximately 84,8 Mio \u20ac/year. The effect on the traditional own\r\nresources of the budget is -63,6 Mio \u20ac/year (75% x 84,8 Mio \u20ac/year).\n2014/0333 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\namending Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013\r\nsuspending the autonomous Common Customs Tariff duties on certain agricultural\r\nand industrial products\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 31 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is in the interest of\r\nthe Union to suspend totally the autonomous Common Customs Tariff duties on 135\r\nnew products which are currently not listed in Annex I to Council Regulation (EU)\r\nNo 1387/2013[1]. Those new products should therefore be inserted into that Annex.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is no longer in the\r\ninterest of the Union to maintain the suspension of autonomous Common Customs\r\nTariff duties on 52 of the products that are currently listed in Annex I to\r\nRegulation (EU) No 1387/2013. Those products should, therefore, be deleted from\r\nthat Annex.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to modify\r\nthe product descriptions of 29 suspensions included in Annex I to Regulation\r\n(EU) No 1387/2013 in order to take account of technical product developments,\r\neconomic trends on the market or to carry out linguistic adaptations. Moreover,\r\nfollowing upcoming changes in the Combined Nomenclature as of 1 January 2015, TARIC\r\ncodes for 95 additional products should be amended. In addition, for one\r\nproduct, mutiple classification is considered no longer necesssary. The\r\nsuspensions in respect of which modifications are necessary should be deleted\r\nfrom the list of suspensions in Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013, and\r\nthe modified suspensions should be reinserted into that list.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tariff suspensions should\r\nbe reviewed regularly with the possibility of deletion on request of a party\r\nconcerned. Where it is justified by the Union's interest tariff suspension is\r\nprolonged and new review date is set. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For 184 products it is\r\nnecessary, in the interest of the Union, to amend the date for their mandatory\r\nreview in order to allow duty free imports beyond that date. Those products\r\nhave been reviewed and have been given revised dates for their next mandatory\r\nreview. Therefore, they should be deleted from the list of suspensions in Annex\r\nI to Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013, and the modified suspensions\r\nshould be reinserted into that list.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary, in the\r\ninterest of the Union, to shorten the period of mandatory review for four\r\nproducts. The suspensions relating to those products should therefore be\r\ndeleted from the list of suspensions in Annex I to\r\nRegulation (EU) No 1387/2013 and the modified suspensions should\r\nbe reinserted into that list.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the interest of\r\nclarity, the modified entries should be marked with an asterisk.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to allow an\r\nappropriate statistical monitoring, Annex II to Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013\r\nshould be completed with supplementary units for some of the new products for\r\nwhich suspensions are granted. For reasons of consistency, the supplementary\r\nunits assigned to the products deleted from Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013\r\nshould also be deleted from Annex II to that Regulation.Regulation (EU) No\r\n1387/2013 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the amendments pursuant\r\nto this Regulation should take effect from 1 January 2015, this\r\nRegulation should apply from that date, \nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nRegulation (EU) No 1387/2013 is amended

take account\r\nof the following:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 new requests for suspension which have\r\nbeen presented and accepted;\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 technical product developments and\r\neconomic trends on the market resulting in the lifting of certain existing\r\nsuspensions.\nAddition\nThis Annex, in addition to the amendments\r\nresulting from description or code changes, contains 135 new products. The\r\nuncollected duties corresponding to these suspensions, calculated on the basis\r\nof requesting Member State projections for the period 2015 to 2019, amount to 48,7 Mio\r\n\u20ac/year.\nOn the basis of the existing statistics for\r\npreceding years, it would appear, however, necessary to increase this amount by\r\nan average factor, estimated at 1,8 to take account of imports into other\r\nMember States using the same suspensions. This means uncollected duties loss of\r\nrevenue of some 87,7 Mio \u20ac /year.\nWithdrawal:\n52 products have been withdrawn from this Annex\r\nreflecting the reintroduction of customs duties. This represents an increase\r\nof\u00a0 2,9 Mio \u20ac in resources, as estimated on the basis of 2013 statistics.\nEstimated cost of this operation\nOn the basis of the above, the impact on the\r\nloss of revenue resulting from this Regulation may be estimated at 87,7 \u20132,9  = 84,8 Mio\r\n\u20ac (gross amount, including collection costs) x 0,75 = 63,6 Mio\r\n\u20ac/year for the
