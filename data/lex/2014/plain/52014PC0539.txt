Taking into account this situation, Annex 3 of\r\nJapan's schedule under the revised GPA does not list the three companies but\u00a0\r\nincludes a note specifying that the companies are nevertheless deemed to remain\r\ncovered until the EU withdraws the objection against the delisting of these\r\ncompanies. \nDuring the scoping exercise for the\r\nEU-Japan Free Trade Agreement the EU expressed its readiness to lift the\r\nobjection to the delisting of the three Japanese companies, against the\r\nbackground of the FTA negotiations on government procurement. This was the\r\napproach adopted by the Council in the Roadmap on Railways and Urban Transport\r\nthat it endorsed together with the negotiating directives. \nIn the light of the positive development of\r\nthe FTA negotiations on railways procurement, \u00a0in particular the confirmation\r\nby Japan of its intention to significantly revise the terms of application of\r\nits GPA reservation on railways ( \"Operational Safety Clause\" as\r\nstipulated under note 4 to Annex 2 and note 3(a) of Annex 3 of Japan) and to\r\npromote transparent and non-discriminatory procurement practices by the three\r\nJR Honshu companies, the European Union can withdraw its objections to the\r\ndelisting of those companies from the GPA coverage of Japan.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nBoth the 1994 and the revised GPA[1]\r\nlay down simplified decision making procedures for the modification of the\r\nlists of entities of each contracting party (\"delisting\"). Those\r\nmodifications take place through the GPA Committee, as the body responsible for\r\nthe operation of the GPA. Where there is no objection to the proposed\r\nmodification in the GPA Committee, the changes in the GPA parties' schedules\r\nare accepted.\u00a0 This decision will have legal effects for the GPA parties\r\nconcerned as it changes the rights and obligations of the parties constituted\r\nunder the agreement.\u00a0\u00a0 \nIn the case of Japan's proposed \"delisting\" of the three\r\nrailway companies, all contracting parties accepted the modification by\r\nabstaining from communicating objections to the Committee, with the exception\r\nof two other GPA parties, which subsequently lifted their objections by means\r\nof notifications.\nIt follows that all contracting parties but the EU have taken a\r\npositive position in the context of the GPA Committee (either by abstaining\r\nfrom formulating objections or by lifting objections). This amounts to\r\nacceptance of Japan's proposed modification. However, since the EU maintains\r\nits objection, the Committee as such cannot be said to have accepted the\r\nmodification. For this to happen, the EU must take a positive position in the\r\ncontext of the GPA Committee, since the other contracting parties have already\r\ndone so.\nThe revised GPA includes a transitional provision to deal with the\r\nsituation in the GPA Committee. This is note 5 of Annex 3 to Japan's schedule in Appendix I of the GPA. By virtue of the note, the three railway\r\ncompanies are deemed to be provisionally included as entities covered by the\r\nGPA. However, the note shall cease to have effect once the EU notifies to the\r\nGPA Committee that it withdraws its objection. There is therefore a continuum\r\nbetween the events in the GPA Committee before the revised GPA entered into\r\nforce and afterwards. The non-objection by the other contracting parties has\r\nfurthermore been confirmed by means of their acceptance of the revised GPA\r\npackage as adopted by the GPA Committee.\nA possible notification to the GPA Committee to lift the objections\r\nshould therefore be regarded as a change of the EU position (which so far has\r\nbeen to object to Japan's modification) in the GPA Committee. A notification\r\nfrom the EU constitutes the last requirement for the GPA Committee procedure to\r\ncome to an end with the collective acceptance of Japan's modification, which\r\nwould have legal effects for all GPA contracting parties, not only the EU. \nUpon receipt of the EU notification, the matter will be on the\r\nagenda on the GPA Committee meeting. In that meeting, the GPA Committee is\r\nexpected to act on the issue as to reflect the fact that in the light of the\r\nchange in the position by the EU as regards the railways companies, note 5 of Annex\r\n3 of Japan's schedule ceases to have effect and to declare the completion of\r\nthe \"delisting procedure\". Later, the Committee would be expected to\r\nreceive a true and certified copy of Annex 3 to Japan's schedule from the GPA\r\nSecretariat, reflecting the new situation.\nArticle 218(9) of the Treaty on the functioning of the European\r\nUnion (TFEU) provides that, when a decision having legal effect needs to be\r\ntaken in a body set up by an international agreement, the Council, on a\r\nproposal from the Commission, should adopt a Decision establishing the position\r\nto be adopted on the Union\u2019s behalf. In the light of the above, the lifting of\r\nthe objections of the Union to the withdrawal of the three entities from\r\nJapan's Annex 3 to Appendix I of the Agreement on Government Procurement falls\r\nunder this provision as \u00a0the decision is taken in a body set up by an\r\ninternational agreement affecting the rights and obligations of the EU.\n2014/0249 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nestablishing the position to be taken by\r\nthe European Union within the Committee on Government Procurement on the\r\nwithdrawal of the Union objections to the delisting of three entities from Japan's Annex 3 to Appendix I to the Agreement on Government Procurement\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article\r\n207(4) in conjunction with Article 218(9) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 29 August 2001 the\r\nnotification of Japan under Article XXIV:6(b) of the 1994 Agreement on\r\nGovernment Procurement, (\u2018the GPA\u2019) on the withdrawal of East Japan Railway\r\nCompany, Central Japan Railway Company and West Japan Railway Company from\r\nAnnex 3 to Appendix I of Japan was circulated to the Parties to the GPA.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 1 October 2001 the\r\nEuropean Union objected, pursuant to Article XXIV:6(b) of the 1994 GPA, to the\r\nproposed modifications as notified by Japan in order to examine thoroughly the\r\nreasons for the intended delisting of those entities as some initial concerns occurred.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Despite the various\r\nconsultations which took place between the Union and Japan, the Union did not withdraw its objections contrary to all other objecting Parties.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 During the revision of the\r\n1994 GPA, account was taken of this situation. Japan did not list the three\r\nconcerned companies in its Annex 3 but included a note specifying that the\r\ncompanies are deemed to be included in its Annex 3 until such time as the\r\nEuropean Union withdraws its objection against the delisting of these\r\ncompanies.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the framework of the\r\nscoping exercise for the EU-Japan Free Trade Agreement and in line with the\r\napproach adopted by the Council on the Roadmap on railways and urban transport and\r\nwithout prejudice to any assessment of the level of competition on the Japanese\r\nrailway market, the Union expressed its readiness to withdraw the objection to\r\nthe delisting of the three Japanese companies, against the background of the\r\nFTA negotiations on government procurement.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the light of the\r\nconfirmation by Japan of its intention to significantly revise the terms of\r\napplication of the operational safety clause as stipulated in note 4 to Annex 2\r\nand note 3(a) to Annex 3 in Japan's schedule in Appendix I to the \u00a0GPA and to\r\npromote transparent and non-discriminatory procurement practices by the three\r\nrailway companies, the European Union should withdraw its objections to the\r\ndelisting of those companies.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The withdrawal of the\r\nobjections should be without prejudice to the Union's position in the GPA Committee\r\non the decision on indicative criteria that demonstrate the effective\r\nelimination of government control or influence over an entity's covered\r\nprocurement, pursuant to Article XIX (8) of the revised GPA, in particular\r\nwhether government control or influence is effectively eliminated where the\r\nentities concerned are not operating in a competitive environment.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is appropriate,\r\ntherefore, to establish the position to be taken by the Union within the WTO Committee\r\non Government Procurement in relation to the withdrawal of the objections,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nThe position to be taken by the European\r\nUnion within the Committee on Government Procurement of the World Trade\r\nOrganization is that the European Union shall withdraw the objections to the\r\nwithdrawal of the East Japan Railway Company, Central Japan Railway Company and\r\nWest Japan Railway Company from Japan's Annex 3 to Appendix I to the Agreement\r\non Government Procurement.\nArticle 2\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the\r\nday of its adoption.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2014/115/EU: Council Decision of 2 December 2013 on\r\nthe conclusion of the Protocol Amending the Agreement on Government\r\nProcurement, OJ L 68, 7.3.2014, p. 1\u20131.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
