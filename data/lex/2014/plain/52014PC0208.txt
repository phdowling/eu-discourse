They also\r\naim to clarify the requirements for fitting fire and smoke dampers and for\r\nremotely controlled fire dampers. In addition new definitions for fire damper\r\nand smoke damper have been added.\nThese changes are set out in Annex 13 in MSC\r\n92/26/Add.1. Para 8.6 of the MSC 92 report (MSC 92/26) indicates that these\r\namendments will be adopted at MSC 93.\n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Amendments to SOLAS\r\nregulation II-2/13.4 concerning additional means of escape from machinery\r\nspaces for new passenger and cargo ships\nChapter II-2 of the SOLAS Convention contains\r\nrequirements for means of escape in case of fire. These amendments to the SOLAS\r\nrequirements aim to ensure that ladders and stairways with open treads in\r\nmachinery spaces which are part of an escape route and not located in a protected\r\nenclosure shall be made of steel. Furthermore, requirements for the escape\r\nroutes from workshops in machinery spaces are introduced.\nThese changes are set out in Annex 13 in MSC\r\n92/26/Add.1. Para 8.17 of the MSC 92 report (MSC 92/26) indicates that these\r\namendments will be adopted at MSC 93.\n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Amendments to SOLAS\r\nregulation II-2/18 concerning helicopter landing areas on ro-ro passenger ships\r\nfor new ships \nChapter II-2 of the SOLAS Convention contains\r\nrequirements for helicopter facilities. These amendments to the SOLAS\r\nConvention aim to introduce IMO Circular MSC.1/Circ.1431 \u2013 Guidelines for the\r\napproval of helicopter facility foam fire-fighting appliances - from 22 June\r\n2012. The foam application system is thus required to be in accordance with these\r\nguidelines.\nThese changes are set out in Annex 13 in MSC\r\n92/26/Add.1. Para 8.30 of the MSC 92 report (MSC 92/26) indicates that these\r\namendments will be adopted at MSC 93.\n1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Amendments to SOLAS\r\nchapter III and associated requirements for periodic servicing and maintenance\r\nof lifeboats and rescue boats for all ships\nChapter III of the SOLAS Convention contains\r\nrequirements for life saving appliances. These amendments to the SOLAS\r\nConvention aim to make the requirements for periodic servicing and maintenance\r\nof lifeboats and rescue boats mandatory.\nThese changes are set out in Annex 31 in MSC\r\n92/26/Add.2. Para 13.16 of the MSC 92 report (MSC 92/26) indicates that these\r\namendments will be adopted at MSC 93.\n1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Amendments to the\r\nLife-Saving Appliances (LSA) Code concerning lifejackets Reference Test Devices\r\n(RTDs) - with associated Revised Recommendations on testing of life-saving\r\nappliances and Guidelines for validating the construction of a completed adult\r\nreference test device\nThe IMO Life Saving Appliances (LSA) Code\r\ncontains requirements for life saving appliances. These amendments to the LSA\r\nCode introduce new requirements for lifejacket Reference Test Devices. \nThese changes are set out in Annex 34 in MSC\r\n92/26/Add.2. Para 13.27.1 of the MSC 92 report (MSC 92/26) indicates that these\r\namendments will be adopted at MSC 93.\n1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Amendments to SOLAS\r\nregulation II-1/29 concerning requirements for steering gear trials\nChapter II-1 of the SOLAS Convention contains\r\nrequirements for steering gear and sets out the means by which compliance may\r\nbe demonstrated. These amendments to SOLAS provide an alternative means of\r\ndemonstrating compliance, where it is impracticable to do so by sea trials with\r\nthe ship at its deepest seagoing draught. . \nThese changes are set out in Annex 35 in MSC\r\n92/26/Add.2. Para 13.29 of the MSC 92 report (MSC 92/26) indicates that these\r\namendments will be adopted at MSC 93.\n1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Amendments to the 2011\r\nEnhanced Survey Programme (ESP) Code, mainly to bring this in line with\r\npractices of the classification societies/Recognized Organizations.\nThe Condition Assessment Scheme (CAS) sets out\r\nthe framework for an intensified inspection of older ships. The enhanced\r\nProgramme of Inspections during surveys of Bulk Carriers and Oil Tankers or\r\nEnhanced Survey Programme (ESP) specifies how to undertake such an intensified\r\ninspection. As the CAS uses the ESP to achieve its aim, the CAS refers to the ESP\r\nas a tool to do so. These amendments to the ESP Code aim to bring the ESP in\r\nline with current practices. \nThese changes are set out in Annex 36 in MSC\r\n92/26/Add.2. Para 13.33 of the MSC 92 report (MSC 92/26) indicates that these\r\namendments will be adopted at MSC 93.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ADOPTION OF THE IMO\r\nAMENDMENTS\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Adoption of amendments to\r\nSOLAS Regulations II-2/1, 2/3, 2/9.7, 2/13.4, 2/18, 2/20-1, 2/29, chapter III,\r\nthe Life Saving Appliances Code and the 2011 Enhanced Survey Programme Code\nThese amendments were approved at the 92nd\r\nsession of the Maritime Safety Committee meeting between 12-21 June 2013 and\r\nare to be submitted for adoption to the 93rd session of that\r\nCommittee meeting between 14-23 May 2014.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Acceptance and entry into\r\nforce. \nOnce approved and adopted by this Committee,\r\nthe above amendments will be submitted to the respective contracting parties in\r\norder for these to express their consent to be bound by the said amendments.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RELEVANT EU LEGISLATION\r\nAND EU COMPETENCE\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Amendments to SOLAS\r\nregulations II-2/3 and II-2/9.7 concerning fire resistance of ventilation ducts\r\nfor new ships\nThe Union already enacted through Chapter II-2\r\nof Annex 1 of Directive 2009/45/EC[1]\r\non safety rules and standards for passenger ships requirements on fire\r\nprotection, detection and extinction. Regulation 12 of part A of this Chapter\r\nprovides for specific requirements for ventilation ducts, which are derived\r\nfrom the same SOLAS provisions which are now expected to be amended. Moreover,\r\nRegulation 9 of Chapter II-2, part B, of the above mentioned Annex sets out comprehensive\r\nand detailed requirements concerning construction materials to be used for\r\nventilation ducts within different parts of the passenger ship depending on its\r\nclass. \u00a0These amendments to SOLAS Chapter II-2, part C, Regulation 9, replace\r\nthe entire paragraph 7 on ventilation systems, covering both the definition and\r\ntesting for duct penetrations, including special arrangements for passenger\r\nships carrying more than 36 passengers.\nAs a result, the requirements provided in\r\nDirective 2009/45/EC on ventilation ducts would need to be revised would the\r\nabove amendments be adopted. This concerns, for example, the duct penetration\r\nprovisions in the Directive's Chapter II-2 of Annex 1, Part A, Regulation 12,\r\nand the ventilation systems for ships carrying more than 36 passengers in Part\r\nB, Regulation 9. \nTherefore, the amendments to SOLAS to be\r\nadopted may affect the requirements provided in Directive 2009/45/EC on\r\nventilation ducts. \n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Amendments to SOLAS\r\nregulation II-2/13.4 concerning additional means of escape from machinery\r\nspaces for new passenger and cargo ships\nThe Union already enacted through Chapter II-2\r\nof Annex 1 of Directive 2009/45/EC requirements on the means of escape from\r\nmachinery spaces for passenger ships, in particular Regulation 6 of Part B\r\n(Fire Safety Measures) of this chapter, which are derived from the same SOLAS\r\nprovisions which are now expected to be amended. \nAs a result, the requirements provided in\r\nDirective 2009/45/EC on means of escape, would need to be revised would the\r\nabove mentioned amendments be adopted, taking into account the specific\r\nprovisions applicable for the bulkhead deck and on escape from machinery\r\ncontrol rooms.\nTherefore, the amendments to SOLAS to be adopted\r\nmay affect the requirements provided in Directive 2009/45/EC on means for\r\nescape from machinery spaces for new passenger ships . \n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Amendments to SOLAS regulation II-2/18 concerning helicopter landing areas on\r\nro-ro passenger ships for new ships \nThe Union already enacted through Chapter II-2\r\nof Annex 1 of Directive 2009/45/EC requirements on the provision of helicopter\r\nlanding areas. In particular, Regulation 18, Part B of this chapter provides that\r\n\"ships equipped with helidecks shall comply with the requirements of\r\nRegulation 18 of Part G of the SOLAS Chapter II-2, as revised per 1 January\r\n2003\". These requirements are now expected to be amended.\nAs a result, the requirements provided in\r\nDirective 2009/45/EC on helicopter landing areas on ro-ro passenger ships for\r\nnew ships would need to be revised would the above mentioned amendments be\r\nadopted.\nTherefore, the amendments to SOLAS to be\r\nadopted may affect the requirements provided in Directive 2009/45/EC on\r\nhelicopter landing areas, by framing any revisions of such rules. \n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Amendments to SOLAS\r\nchapter III and associated requirements for periodic servicing and maintenance\r\nof lifeboats and rescue boats for all ship\nThe Union already enacted through Regulation 12\r\nof Chapter III of Annex 1 of Directive 2009/45/EC on safety rules and standards\r\nfor passenger ships requirements on the operational readiness, maintenance and\r\ninspection of life-saving appliances. Regulation 12.2 provides that that \"maintenance\r\nand inspections of life-saving appliances shall be carried out in accordance\r\nwith the requirements of SOLAS Regulation III/20.\" Thus the Directive\r\nrequires compliance with the relevant SOLAS provisions which are now expected\r\nto be amended and any change will have a direct effect on EU law.\nTherefore, the proposed amendment of the\r\nrelevant SOLAS provisions will affect the requirements laid down in Directive\r\n2009/45/EC on the operational readiness, maintenance and inspection of\r\nlife-saving appliances.\n3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Amendments to the\r\nLife-Saving Appliances (LSA) Code concerning lifejackets Reference Test Devices\r\n(RTDs) - with associated Revised Recommendations on testing of life-saving appliances and Guidelines for validating the\r\nconstruction of a completed adult reference test device\nThe Union already enacted through Chapter III\r\nof Annex 1 of Directive 2009/45/EC on safety rules and standards for passenger\r\nships contains requirements on personal life saving appliances. In particular, Regulation\r\n2.2 of this chapter indicates that all such appliances \"shall comply\r\nwith\u2026the LSA Code\". \nIn addition, Article 5(1) of Directive 96/98/EC[2] on marine equipment provides\r\nthat \"Equipment listed in Annex A.1 that is placed on board a Community\r\nship \u2026shall meet the applicable requirements of the international instruments\r\nreferred to in that Annex\". In point A.1.1.4 in the table in Annex\r\nA.1, the applicable standard for life jackets is IMO Resolution MSC 48(66) (the\r\nLSA Code) and the applicable testing standards are those stipulated in IMO\r\nResolution A.689(17) as amended. \nThus both Directives require compliance with\r\nthe SOLAS provisions which are now expected to be amended and any change of these\r\nrules will have a direct effect on EU law.\nTherefore, the proposed amendments to the LSA\r\nCode will affect the requirements laid down Directive 2009/45/EC and Directive\r\n96/98/EC.\n3.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Amendments to SOLAS\r\nregulation II-1/29 concerning requirements for steering gear trials\nThe Union already enacted through Regulations 6\r\nand 7 of Chapter II-1, Part C of Annex 1 of Directive 2009/45/EC requirements\r\nfor steering gear trials, which are derived from and replicate the same provisions\r\nof SOLAS which are now expected to be amended. \nAs a result, the requirements of Directive\r\n2009/45/EC on main and auxiliary steering gear would need to be revised would\r\nthe above mentioned amendments be adopted, taking into account the new SOLAS\r\nprovisions.\nTherefore, the amendments to SOLAS to be\r\nadopted may affect the requirements provided in Directive 2009/45/EC. \n3.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Amendments to the 2011\r\nEnhanced Survey Programme (ESP) Code, mainly to bring this in line with\r\npractices of the classification societies/Recognised Organisations.\nRegulation (EU) No 530/2012[3] on the accelerated\r\nphasing-in of double hull or equivalent design requirements for single-hull oil\r\ntankers aims to establish an accelerated phasing-in\r\nscheme for the application of the double-hull or equivalent design requirements\r\nof MARPOL 73/78, as defined in Article 3 of this Regulation, to single-hull oil\r\ntankers, and to ban the transport to or from ports of the Member States of\r\nheavy grade oil in single-hull oil tankers.\nThis Regulation makes mandatory the application\r\nof the IMO's Condition Assessment Scheme (CAS) to single hull oil tankers above\r\n15 years of age. Article 5 requires such tankers to comply with the CAS, which\r\nis then defined in Article 6 as the Condition Assessment Scheme adopted by\r\nResolution MEPC 94(46) of 27 April 2001 as amended by Resolution MEPC 99(48) of\r\n11 October 2002 and by Resolution MEPC 112(50) of 4 December 2003. The Enhanced\r\nProgramme of Inspections during surveys of Bulk Carriers and Oil tankers or\r\nEnhanced Survey Programme (ESP) specifies how to undertake this intensified\r\nassessment. As CAS uses ESP as the tool to achieve its aim, any changes to the\r\nESP inspections will be directly and automatically be applicable through\r\nRegulation (EU) No 530/2012. \nTherefore, the amendments due to be adopted at\r\nMSC 93, which would introduce changes to the ESP Code, would affect EU law,\r\nthrough the application of Regulation (EU) No 530/2012.\n3.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Summary\nIn view of the relevant EU legislation above,\r\nthe Commission considers that the adoption of the seven above-cited amendments\r\nexpected to be adopted at MSC 93 comes under EU exclusive competence, which the\r\nUnion has acquired pursuant to Article 3(2) TFEU, in so far as the adoption of\r\nthe international instruments at stake may affect common rules or alter their\r\nscope. \nConsistent with a well consolidated body of\r\ncase law, even if the Union is not a member of IMO, the Member States are not\r\nauthorised to assume obligations likely to affect EU rules promulgated for the\r\nattainment of the objectives of the Treaties, unless they are authorised to do\r\nso by means of a Council decision, on a proposal by the Commission \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CONCLUSION\nThe Commission therefore proposes a Council\r\nDecision on the position to be adopted on behalf of the European Union for the amendments\r\ncited in paras 1.1 to 1.7 above to be adopted at the 93rd session of\r\nthe Maritime Safety Committee respectively.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n2014/0119 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the position to be adopted on behalf of\r\nthe European Union at the International Maritime Organization during the 93rd\r\nsession of the Maritime Safety Committee on the adoption of amendments to SOLAS\r\nRegulations II-2/1, 2/3, 2/9.7, 2/13.4, 2/18, 2/20-1, 2/29, chapter III, the\r\nLife Saving Appliances Code and the 2011 Enhanced Survey Programme Code\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 100(2) and Article\r\n218(9) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Action by the European\r\nUnion in the sector of maritime transport should aim to improve maritime safety.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The IMO Maritime Safety\r\nCommittee (MSC) meeting at its 92nd session approved amendments to SOLAS\r\nRegulations II-2/1, 2/3. 2/9.7, 2/13.4, 2/18, 2/20-1, 2/29, Chapter III, the\r\nLife Saving Appliances Code and the 2011 Enhanced Survey Programme Code.

Articles 5 and 6 of Regulation (EU) No 530/2012[6] on the accelerated\r\nphasing-in of double hull or equivalent design requirements for single-hull oil\r\ntankers make mandatory the application of the IMO's Condition Assessment Scheme\r\n(CAS) to single hull oil tankers above 15 years of age. The Enhanced Programme\r\nof Inspections during surveys of Bulk Carriers and Oil tankers or Enhanced\r\nSurvey Programme (ESP) specifies how to undertake this intensified assessment.\r\nAs CAS uses ESP as the tool to achieve its aim, any changes to the ESP\r\ninspections will automatically be applicable through Regulation (EU) No\r\n530/2012. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union is neither a\r\nmember of the IMO nor a contracting party to the conventions and codes\r\nconcerned.
