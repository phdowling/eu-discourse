Summary

2014/0358(NLE) - 09/01/2015 Initial legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to approve, on behalf of the European Union, the Amendments to the 1998 Protocol to the 1979 Convention on Long-Range
Transboundary Air Pollution on Persistent Organic Pollutants.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: the Union is a Party to the UNECE Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution following its approval in 1981 .
The Convention is the main international legal framework for cooperation and measures to limit and gradually reduce and prevent air pollution
and its adverse effects upon human health and the environment in the UNECE region.
To date, the Convention has been extended by eight Protocols, including the 1998 Aarhus Protocol on Persistent Organic Pollutants which
aims to control, reduce or eliminate discharges, emissions and losses of persistent organic pollutants (POPs). The Union is a Party to the 1998
Protocol following its approval on 19 February 2004.
The Parties present at the 27th session of the Executive Body of the UNECE Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution adopted
by consensus Decisions 2009/1, 2009/2, 2009/3 and 2009/4 amending the Protocol to the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air
Pollution on Persistent Organic Pollutants.
Decision 2009/3 entered into force and has become effective. Decision 2009/4, as a Decision aimed at adopting a guidance document on best
available techniques to control emissions of persistent organic pollutants, does not require ratification. On the other hand, Decisions 2009/1
and 2009/2 require ratification by the Parties to the Protocol.
CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve, on behalf of the European Union, the amendments to the Protocol to the
Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution on Persistent Organic Pollutants.
In particular, Decisions 2009/1 and 2009/2, which amend the text of the Protocol and its Annexes have to be ratified by the Parties. The
amended Protocol includes:
new substances (hexachlorobutadiene, tetra-, penta-, hexa- and heptabromodiphenyl ethers, pentachlorobenzene, perfluorooctane
sulfonate (PFOS), polychlorinated naphthalenes and short-chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCP)),
updates the implementation requirements applicable to DDT, heptachlor, hexachlorobenzene and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)
and the emission limit values (ELVs) applicable to PCDD/PCDF emissions from certain waste incinerators,
establishes new ELVs for PCDD/PCDF emissions from sinterplants and electric arc furnaces,
adds PCBs to the list of substances the annual emissions of which must remain below the emission level of the reference year and
must be reported.
The amended Protocol provides also some flexibility for Parties with an economy in transition that accede to the amended Protocol regarding
the timeframes for the application of the ELVs and of the best available techniques (BAT) and the choice of the reference year as the basis
upon which Parties must reduce their total annual emissions of PCDD/PCDF, PAHs, hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and PCBs.

2014/0358(NLE) - 02/06/2015 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to approve, on behalf of the European Union, the Amendments to the 1998 Protocol to the 1979 Convention on Long-Range

and 2009/2 require ratification by the Parties to the Protocol.
The Union has already adopted instruments on matters covered by the amendments to the Protocol, including Regulation (EC) No 850/2004 of
the European Parliament and of the Council.
The amendments to the Protocol set out in Decisions 2009/1 and 2009/2 should therefore be accepted on behalf of the Union.
CONTENT: the Council is invited to accept, on behalf of the European Union, the amendments to the Protocol to the Convention on
Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution on Persistent Organic Pollutants.
In particular, Decisions 2009/1 and 2009/2, which amend the text of the Protocol and its Annexes have to be ratified by the Parties. The
amended Protocol includes:
new substances (hexachlorobutadiene, tetra-, penta-, hexa- and heptabromodiphenyl ethers, pentachlorobenzene, perfluorooctane

2014/0358(NLE) - 07/01/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety adopted the report by Giovanni LA VIA (EPP, IT) on the draft Council
decision on the acceptance of the Amendments to the 1998 Protocol to the 1979 Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution on
Persistent Organic Pollutants.
The committee recommended the European Parliament to give its consent to acceptance of the Amendments to the Protocol.
To recall, the 1998 Aarhus Protocol on Persistent Organic Pollutants (the Protocol) aims to control, reduce or eliminate discharges, emissions
and losses of POPs . It requires Parties to eliminate the production and use of relevant substances, restrict the use of
dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCH) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and reduce their total annual
emissions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), dioxins/furans (PCDD/PCDF) and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) below their levels in 1990
or an alternative year between 1985 and 1995.
The accession of the Community to the Protocol was approved on behalf of the Community by Council Decision 2004/259/EC. The Protocol,
which entered into force on 23 October 2003, has been transposed into EU law through several instruments.
In December 2009, the Protocol was amended by Decisions 2009/1, 2009/2, 2009/3 and 2009/4. The amended Protocol includes seven new
substances, updates implementation requirements for several substances, updates restrictions for PCDD/PCDF emissions from several
sources, and adds PCBs to the list of substances affected by the total annual emission restrictions and reporting obligations.
As set out in the short justification to the recommendation, the draft Council Decision lists the texts of the amendments to the Protocol via
Decisions 2009/1 and 2009/2 in its Annexes. The amendments are fully consistent with existing EU legislation. Specific exemptions and
flexible transition timetables for economies in transition should allow all Parties to comply with the Protocol.
The ratification of the amendments will be an important step towards a higher level of protection of human health and the environment from
transboundary air pollution. Members therefore welcomed the draft Council Decision and proposed that Parliament gives its consent.

2014/0358(NLE) - 02/02/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 624 votes to 21, with 34 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the draft Council decision on the
acceptance of the Amendments to the 1998 Protocol to the 1979 Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution on Persistent
Organic Pollutants.
Following the recommendation from its Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, Parliament gave its consent to acceptance
of the Amendments to the Protocol.

To recall, the 1979 Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution is intended to protect the human environment against air pollution.
The 1998 Aarhus Protocol on Persistent Organic Pollutants (the Protocol) aims to control, reduce or eliminate discharges, emissions and
losses of POPs. It requires Parties to eliminate the production and use of relevant substances, restrict the use of
dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCH) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and reduce their total annual
emissions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), dioxins/furans (PCDD/PCDF) and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) below their levels in 1990
or an alternative year between 1985 and 1995.
