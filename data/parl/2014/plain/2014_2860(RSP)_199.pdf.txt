Summary

For information

2014/2860(RSP) - 23/10/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a resolution prepared by its Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the proposal for a Council
directive implementing the European Agreement concluded by the European Barge Union (EBU), the European Skippers Organisation (ESO)
and the European Transport Workers Federation (ETF) concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time in inland waterway
transport.

Members recalled that the Agreement concluded certain aspects of the organisation of working time in inland waterway transport between the
relevant Parties. The Agreement included a joint request for the Commission to implement it by a Council decision on a proposal from the
Commission, in accordance with Article 155(2) TFEU. In this regard, Members recommended the adoption of the future Directive by
welcoming the fact that:
Article 155(2) TFEU provides for the possibility of implementing agreements concluded at EU level, at the joint request of the signatory
parties, by a Council decision on a proposal from the Commission;
Article 155(1) TFEU gives the social partners at EU level the possibility, should they so desire, to enter into a dialogue which may lead
to contractual relations, including agreements.
In parallel, Members welcomed the fact that the Agreement as concluded by the social partners and the Commission proposal provide only for
minimum requirements, leaving the Member States and/or social partners free to adopt measures which are more favourable to workers in the
area concerned.
