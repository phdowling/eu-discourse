Summary

The European Parliament adopted a resolution on the situation in Thailand. The resolution was tabled by the S&D, EPP, ECR, ALDE, and
Greens/EFA groups. It expressed deep concern over the degeneration of political and socio-economic differences into violent clashes between
government and opposition, and between demonstrators and security forces in Thailand. It called on all parties to respect the rule of law,
stressing that elections must be free and fair. Members condemned the destructive actions of anti-government protestors who prevented
voters from casting their ballots on 26 January 2014 and 2 February 2014. They underlined the fact that the proposal of the Peoples
Democratic Reform Committee for an unelected Peoples Council to replace the government and rule the country for up to two years was
undemocratic. At the same time, Parliament appealed to the authorities to immediately revoke the state of emergency declared by the Prime
Minister on 21 January 2014, as the existing laws were adequate to deal with the current situation.
Noting that during the unrest, which had lasted for months, several people had been killed and hundreds injured, Parliament urged the
international community to put all its efforts into stopping the violence. The Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative is asked to
follow the political situation closely and coordinate actions with ASEAN and the United Nations in order to foster dialogue and strengthen
democracy in the country.
Members also noted the excellent nature of EU-Thai relations and Thailands role as a source of prosperity and stability in the region,
underlining the fact that negotiations for a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and Thailand had been concluded and
that the Agreement engaged the two parties to reaffirm their strong attachment to democratic principles and human rights.
They called on both government supporters and anti-government demonstrators to refrain from any political violence and move forward within
Thailands democratic and constitutional framework. The leaders of the Democrat Party were asked to allow the parliament, elected by the
people of Thailand, to fulfil its mandate. The resolution urged the government, the Electoral Commission and the opposition to initiate an
inclusive and time-bound process of institutional and political reforms, which could be approved through a national referendum and followed by
inclusive, secure, free and fair elections.
Lastly, Parliament urged the military to maintain its neutrality and play a positive role in order to ensure peaceful resolution of the ongoing
crisis.
