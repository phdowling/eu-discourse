2014/2118(DEC) - 30/07/2014 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: presentation by the Commission of the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2013, as part of
the 2013 discharge procedure.
Analysis of the accounts of the European Police Office (EUROPOL).
CONTENT: this Commission document sets out the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2013 as
prepared on the basis of the information presented by the institutions, organisations and bodies of the EU, in accordance with Article 129 (2) of
the Financial Regulation applicable to the EU's General Budget, including the European Police Office (EUROPOL).
The document contains the figures on which the discharge procedure is based.
Discharge procedure of the EU agencies: the EU Budget finances a wide range of policies and programmes throughout the EU. In accordance
with the priorities set by the European Parliament and the Council in the multi-annual financial framework (MFF), the European Commission
carries out specific programmes, activities and projects in the field with the technical support of some specialised agencies.
The consolidated annual accounts of the EU provide information on the activities of the institutions, agencies and other bodies of the EU from
a budgetary and accrual accounting perspective.
The consolidated reports on the implementation of the general budget of the EU include the budget implementation of all Institutions. Agencies
do not have a separate budget inside the EU budget; and they are partially financed by a Commission budget subsidy.
Each agency is subject to its own discharge procedure.
EUROPOL: in 2013, the tasks and budget of this agency were as follows:
description of EUROPOL's tasks: the European Police Office (the Office), which is located in The Hague, was established by Council
Decision 2009/371/JHA. The objective of the Office is to support and strengthen action by the competent authorities of the Member
States and their mutual cooperation in preventing and combating organised crime, terrorism and other forms of serious crime affecting
two or more Member States;

EUROPOLs budget for the 2013 financial year: EUROPOLs budget for 2013, as presented in the Commission document on the
consolidated annual accounts of the European Union, gives the following figures:
§

Commitment appropriations :
- committed : EUR 84 million;
- paid : EUR 82 million;
- carried-over : 0.

§

Payment appropriations :
- committed : EUR 100 million;
- paid : EUR 87 million;
- carried-over : EUR 10 million.

Please refer also to the final accounts of EUROPOL.

2014/2118(DEC) - 16/09/2014 Court of Auditors: opinion, report
PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the European Police Office (Europol) for the year 2013,
together with Europols reply.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit concerned, amongst others, the annual accounts of the European Police Office (Europol).
Statement of assurance: pursuant to the provisions of Article 287 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the Court
has audited:
the annual accounts of the Office, which comprise the financial statements and the reports on the implementation of the budget for the
financial year ended 31 December 2013;
the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying those accounts.
Opinion on the reliability of the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the Offices annual accounts present fairly, in all material respects, its financial
position as at 31 December 2013 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions
of its Financial Regulation and the accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
Opinion on the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the transactions underlying the annual
accounts for the year ended 31 December 2013 are legal and regular in all material respects.
The report also makes a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of Europol, accompanied by the latters response.
The main observations may be summarised as follows:
The Courts observations:
legality and regularity of transactions: although the Office has improved the preparation, execution and documentation of procurement
procedures over the years, not all decisions taken in 2013 were based on sufficiently specific selection criteria, realistic price offers or
in accordance with the established professional requirements;
budgetary management: carry-overs of committed appropriations were still high for administrative expenditure with EUR 3 million or
41%. They mainly related to planned modifications of the building late in the year.
Europols reply:
legality and regularity of transactions: Europol stated that in the first quarter of 2014, Europol initiated an organisational-wide review of
the overall procurement process (in particular regarding the key stages of tendering, contracting and monitoring of contracts), with a
view to refining the current internal organisational set-up and the underlying processes (including respective quality controls);
budgetary management: Europol acknowledged the ECAs comment on the high level of carry forward appropriations for administrative
expenditure and will continue its efforts to reduce future carry forwards as much as possible.
The Court of Auditors report contains a summary of Europols activities in 2013. They mainly focused on:
Budget: EUR 82.5 million.
Activities:
support centre for law enforcement operations: operational support to operations and Joint Investigation Teams (JITs) including data
processing, cross-match reports, intelligence notifications, etc;
strategic analysis capability: production of strategic products including threat assessments and situation reports;
reporting: 38 strategic reports on organised crime and 14 strategic reports on terrorism;
information hub: information management capabilities, Secure Information Exchange Network Application (SIENA), Europol
Information System (EIS), Liaison Bureaux network ;
law enforcement expertise: Europol Platforms for Experts (EPE), Data exchange platforms and storage solutions, Knowledge
products and services, Training, Conferences and awareness sessions;
cooperation with third countries and international organisations.

2014/2118(DEC) - 30/03/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Ryszard CZARNECKI (ECR, PL) on discharge in respect of the implementation of
the budget of the European Police Office for the financial year 2013.
It called on the European Parliament to grant the Director of EUROPOL discharge in respect of the implementation of the Offices budget for
the financial year 2013.
Noting that the Court of Auditors had stated that it had obtained reasonable assurances that the Offices annual accounts were reliable and that
the underlying transactions were legal and regular, Members called on Parliament to approve the closure of the accounts of EUROPOL for the
financial year 2013. At the same time, they made a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is
granted, in addition to the general recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of
EU agencies.
EUROPOLs financial statements: Members noted that the final budget of the the Office for the financial year 2013 was EUR 82 520
500, representing a decrease of 1.94% compared to 2012.
Commitments and carryovers: Members noted that budget monitoring efforts during the financial year 2013 resulted in a budget
implementation rate of 98.6% and that the payment appropriations execution rate was 87.2%. They acknowledged that the level of
committed appropriations carried over decreased but that the level of carry-overs of committed appropriations was still high at 41% for
administrative expenditure. They called on the Office to increase its efforts to reduce future carry-overs.
Members also made a series of observations on procurement procedures, recruitment, internal audits and the prevention and management of
conflicts of interests.
With regard to the legality and regularity of transactions, Members observed that the effectiveness of the procurement procedures in 2013 was
affected by some decisions not being based on sufficiently specific selection criteria or realistic price offers, as well as by not being in
accordance with the established professional requirements. They called on the Office to inform the discharge authority on the outcome of the
review and planned improvements to the procurement process. The committee recalled the Courts comment in its 2011 report that the Office's
Financial Regulation referred to detailed rules and procedures laid down in the Office's Implementing Rules which had not yet been adopted. It
urged the Office to take corrective actions in this regard.
Lastly, Members noted that it was envisaged that the Europol Pension Fund would be consolidated with the annual accounts of the Office with
effect as of 1 January 2016.

Article 5(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament).

2013 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Parliament adopted by 567 votes to 103, with 14 abstentions, a
