2014/0160(COD) - 27/05/2014 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: codification of Regulation (EEC) No 2843/72 of the Council of 19 December 1972 on the safeguard measures provided for in the
Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Iceland.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: Regulation (EEC) No 2843/72 of the Council has been substantially amended several times. It is recalled that in 1987, the
Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum
requirement. The Edinburgh European Council in December 1992 confirmed the importance of codification as it offers certainty as to the law
applicable to a given matter at a given time.
The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an
accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments.
CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and transparency of Union law, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Regulation
(EEC) No 2843/72 on the safeguard measures provided for in the Agreement between the European Economic Community and Iceland.
The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it; it fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does
no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself.
Main provisions codified: an Agreement between the European Economic Community and Iceland was signed in Brussels on 22 July 1972.
Detailed rules are necessary for implementing the safeguard clauses and precautionary measures provided for in the Agreement.

The implementation of the bilateral safeguard clauses of the Agreement requires uniform conditions for the adoption of safeguard measures.
Those measures should be adopted in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council. The
Commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases relating to situations referred to in the
proposal (notably in the case of export aids that have a direct and immediate effect on trade, imperative grounds of urgency so require).
It should be noted that the future Regulation shall repeal Regulation (EEC) No 2843/72

2014/0160(COD) - 14/11/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Legal Affairs adopted the report by Andrzej DUDA (ECR, PL) on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament
and of the Council on the safeguard measures provided for in the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Republic
of Iceland (codified text).
It recommended the European Parliament to adopt its position at first reading, taking over the Commission proposal as adapted to the
recommendations of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
The Consultative Working Party stated that the proposal in question contains a straightforward codification of the existing texts without any
change in their substance.

2014/0160(COD) - 11/02/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 630 votes to 27, with 34 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council on the safeguard measures provided for in the Agreement between the European Economic
Community and the Republic of Iceland (codified text).
Parliament adopted its position at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure taking over the Commission proposal as adapted to
the recommendations of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
According to the Consultative Working Party, the proposal in question contains a straightforward codification of the existing texts without any
change in their substance.
Following the Agreement signed between the European Economic Community and Iceland on 22 July 1972, detailed rules are necessary for
implementing the safeguard clauses and precautionary measures in order to ensure a balanced implementation of the Agreement.
The regulation lays down uniform implementing conditions by conferring implementing powers on the Commission.

2014/0160(COD) - 11/03/2015 Final act
PURPOSE: to codify of Regulation (EEC) No 2843/72 of the Council of 19 December 1972 on the safeguard measures provided for in the
Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Iceland.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Regulation (EU) 2015/475 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the safeguard measures provided for in the
Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Iceland (codification).
CONTENT: the Regulation codifies and repeals Council Regulation (EEC) No 2843/72 which has been substantially amended on several
occasions.
It sets out the detailed rules necessary for implementing the safeguard clauses and precautionary measures provided for in the Agreement
between the European Economic Community and Iceland of 22 July 1972.
The Commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases relating to situations referred to in the
proposal (notably in the case of export aids that have a direct and immediate effect on trade, imperative grounds of urgency so require).
Where the Commission is requested to take action by a Member State, it shall take a decision on that request within a maximum period of five
working days of its receipt.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 16.4.2015.
