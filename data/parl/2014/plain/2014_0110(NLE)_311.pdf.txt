OJ L 202 28.07.2016, p. 0003 Summary

2014/0110(NLE) - 31/03/2014 Initial legislative proposal
PURPOSE: the conclusion of a Protocol to the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an Association between the European Community

and its Member States, of the one part, and Lebanon, of the other part, on a Framework Agreement between the European Union and
Lebanon on the general principles for the participation of that country in Union programmes.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to it.
BACKGROUND: as part of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), the gradual opening up of certain European Union programmes and
agencies to ENP partner countries is one of many measures to promote reform, modernisation and transition in the European Union?s
neighbourhood. The Commission has expanded on this in its Communication ?on the general approach to enable European Neighbourhood
Policy partner countries to participate in Community agencies and Community programmes?. The Council endorsed this approach in
conclusions on 5 March 2007.
The Council, on 18 June 2007, issued directives to the Commission to negotiate Framework Agreements with Algeria, Armenia, Azerbaijan,
Egypt, Georgia, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Moldova, Morocco, the Palestinian Authority, Tunisia and Ukraine, on the general principles for their
participation in Community programmes. To date, Protocols have been signed with Armenia, Georgia, Israel, Jordan, Moldova, Morocco and
Ukraine.
In December 2013, Lebanon expressed its interest in participating in the broad range of programmes open to partner countries of the
European Neighbourhood Policy. The text of the Protocol negotiated with Lebanon is attached and the subject of this proposal. It is now
appropriate for the European Union to conclude the protocol.
LEGAL BASIS: Article 212 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) and Article 218(7)
thereof.
CONTENT: this is a proposal for a Council Decision on the conclusion of the Protocol. This Protocol contains a Framework Agreement on the
general principles for the participation of Lebanon in Union programmes. It contains standard conditions that should be applied to all European
Neighbourhood Policy partner countries with whom such protocols are to be concluded.
Objectives: the protocol seeks to define the financial and technical rules permitting Lebanon to participate in certain EU programmes.
The horizontal framework established by the Protocol sets out principles for economic, financial and technical cooperation measure and allows
Lebanon to receive technical assistance, in particular financial assistance, from the European Union pursuant to the European Union
programmes.

2014/0110(NLE) - 10/12/2014 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude a Protocol to the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an Association between the European Community and
its Member States, of the one part, and Lebanon, of the other part, on a Framework Agreement between the European Union and Lebanon on
the general principles for the participation of Lebanon in Union programmes.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: in accordance with a Council Decision, the Protocol to the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an Association
between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and Lebanon, of the other part, on a Framework Agreement
between the European Union and Lebanon on the general principles for the participation of Lebanon in Union programmes was signed on
behalf of the Union.
The Protocol should be approved on behalf of the Union.
CONTENT: under this proposed Decision, the Council is requested to conclude the Protocol to the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement
establishing an Association between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and Lebanon, of the other part, on a
Framework Agreement between the European Union and Lebanon on the general principles for the participation of Lebanon in Union
programmes on behalf of the Union.
Objectives of the Protocol: the objective of the Protocol is to lay down the financial and technical rules enabling Lebanon to participate in
certain Union programmes. The horizontal framework established by the Protocol sets out principles for economic, financial and technical
cooperation and allows Lebanon to receive assistance, in particular financial assistance, from the Union pursuant to those programmes.
That framework applies only to those Union programmes for which the relevant constitutive legal acts provide for the possibility of the
participation of Lebanon.
The conclusion of the Protocol does not therefore entail the exercise of powers under the various sectoral policies pursued by the
programmes, which are exercised when establishing the programmes.
For further details of the Protocol, please refer to the summary of the Commissions initial legislative proposal dated 31/03/2014.
