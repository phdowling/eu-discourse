2014/2217(INI) - 28/01/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality adopted the own-initiative report by Marc TARABELLA (S&D, BE) on progress on
equality between women and men in the European Union in 2013.
The report called upon EU institutions and Member States to:
·

mainstream the issues of gender, womens rights and equal opportunities in their policy making, and budget procedures especially in
connection with stimulus packages, by carrying out gender impact analyses on a case-by-case basis;

·

integrate a gender pillar into the Europe 2020 strategy to measure progress on reducing the gender gap in employment

·

develop a general plan for investment into social infrastructure, as it has been estimated that with a gendered investment plan,
European gross domestic product (GDP) would increase more than without such an investment plan.

The report made certain recommendations, inter alia :
·

fight against poverty among women, and older women and single mothers in particular, but also women who are victims of
gender-based violence, women with disabilities, migrant women and women from minorities, mainly through the European Social
Fund and the Structural Funds;

·

allow for changes in the family unit when drawing up their taxation and compensation policies, in particular by providing support to
one-parent families and older people in the form of tax credits or health care assistance;

·

reduce gender gaps in pay and pension also by addressing the persistent concentration of women in part-time, low-pay and
precarious work and by securing care facilities of a sufficient quality for children. Give full effect to the rights provided for under
Directive 2006/54/EC, including the principle of equal pay and pay transparency;

·

implement proactive policies to promote good jobs for women in order to meet the Europe 2020 targets by combating stereotypes
and vertical and horizontal occupational segregation;

·

set specific employment targets in the framework of their national reform programmes to ensure that women have the same
opportunities as men to access and stay in the labour market;

·

establish affordable, flexible, high-quality and easily accessible services for the care of people who are unable to cope with everyday
tasks by themselves due to fact that they do not possess the functional autonomy they need to strike a balance between their
personal, family and working lives.

Deploring the deadlock in the Council regarding the maternity leave directive, the report urged Member States to resume the negotiations
thereon and Members reiterated their willingness to cooperate.
They also called on the Commission to take decisive policy action to fight gender stereotypes and suggested to the Member States that they
raise awareness of equal rights and equal opportunities for men and women in their educational systems.
On the issue of violence against women, Members renewed their call on the Commission to submit a proposal for a legislative act establishing
measures to promote and support the action of Member States in the field of preventing violence against women and girls, by supporting a
comprehensive and effective policy framework on gender-based violence. Member States must work systematically on empowering women in
reporting violence to authorities.
The Commission and the Member States were asked to make 2016 the European year against violence against women.

The committee maintained that women must have control over their sexual and reproductive health and rights, not least by having ready
access to contraception and abortion.
Lastly, it considered it unfortunate that the annual report now ranked only as a working document annexed to the report on the application of
the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and urged the Commission to restore the full political legitimacy of the annual report
by having it officially adopted in its own right.

2014/2217(INI) - 10/03/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 441 votes to 205, with 52 abstentions, a resolution on progress on equality between women and men in
the European Union in 2013.
Equality and Europe 2020 strategy: Parliament called on the European Institutions and the Member States to:
mainstream the issues of gender, womens rights and equal opportunities in their policy making, budget procedures and the implementation of
EU programmes and activities, by means of pro-active measures, especially in connection with stimulus packages;
·

integrate a gender pillar into the Europe 2020 strategy to measure progress on reducing the gender gap in employment;

·

develop a general plan for investment into social infrastructure, as it has been estimated that with a gendered investment plan,
European gross domestic product (GDP) would increase gradually.

The resolution stressed that need to tackle poverty among women, and in particular older women and single mothers by implementing more
effective inclusion strategies and making more efficient use of social policy resources, not least the European Social Fund and the Structural
Funds. Members called for the Country-Strategy Recommendations (CSRs) systemically to address the structural causes of female poverty.
Equality in the areas of employment and decision-making: noting that the gender gap in pay stands at 16.4% and that women make up 17.8%
of the membership of large company boards, Parliament stressed the need to:
·

reduce gender gaps in pay and pension also by addressing the persistent concentration of women in part-time, low-pay and
precarious work. Give full effect to the rights provided for under Directive 2006/54/EC, including the principle of equal pay and pay
transparency;

·

set specific employment targets in the framework of their national reform programmes to ensure that women have the same
opportunities as men to access and stay in the labour market;

·

implement proactive policies to promote good jobs for women in order to meet the Europe 2020 targets by combating stereotypes
and encouraging women to embrace careers in science;

·

promote gender equality through, inter alia, the presence of women in economic and political decision making and, which is a
question of fundamental rights and democracy.

Reconciliation of professional and private life: stressing the fact that increased flexibility in working arrangements can increase womens
opportunities to participate actively in the labour market, but, at the same time, has a negative impact on womens wages and pensions;
Parliament pointed out the need for specific work-life balance proposals, and encourages men and women to share occupational, family, and
social responsibilities more evenly. It called on the Commission to provide continuing financial support to Member States so that they can offer
affordable childcare systems.
Parliament called on the Commission and the Member States to establish paid paternity leave of at least ten working days. It also urged
Member States to resume the negotiations on the maternity leave directive which is still at deadlock in the Council.
Violence against women: Parliament renewed its call on the Commission to submit a proposal for a legislative act establishing measures to
promote and support the action of Member States in the field of preventing violence against women and girls, by supporting a comprehensive
and effective policy framework on gender-based violence. Member States must work systematically on empowering women in reporting
violence to authorities.
Gender stereotypes: the resolution called on the Commission to take decisive policy action to fight gender stereotypes and suggested to the
Member States that they raise awareness of equal rights and equal opportunities for men and women in their educational systems.
Parliament maintained that women must have control over their sexual and reproductive health and rights, not least by having ready access to
contraception and abortion.
Lastly, it considered it unfortunate that the annual report now ranked only as a working document annexed to the report on the application of
the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and urged the Commission to restore the full political legitimacy of the annual report
by having it officially adopted in its own right.
