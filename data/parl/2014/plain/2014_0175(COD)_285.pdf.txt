2014/0175(COD) - 12/06/2014 Initial legislative proposal
PURPOSE: codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 673/2005 of 25 April 2005 establishing additional customs duties on imports of certain
products originating in the United States of America.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an
equal footing with the Council.
CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and legal transparency, the purpose of the present proposal is to proceed with the codification of Council
Regulation (EC) No 673/2005 of 25 April 2005 establishing additional customs duties on imports of certain products originating in the United
States of America.
Council Regulation (EC) No 673/2005 has been substantially amended several times.
It is recalled that on 1 April 1987 the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten
amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Edinburgh European Council, in December 1992, confirmed this, stressing the
importance of codification.
The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an
accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments.
The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it; this proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and
hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself.

2014/0175(COD) - 17/07/2015 Initial legislative proposal
PURPOSE: codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 673/2005 of 25 April 2005 establishing additional customs duties on imports of certain
products originating in the United States of America.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: on 27 January 2003, the Dispute Settlement Body (?DSB?) of the World Trade Organisation (?WTO?) adopted the Appellate
Body report and the Panel report finding that the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act (?CDSOA?) was incompatible with the United
States' obligations under the WTO agreements.
Since the United States failed to bring its legislation into conformity with the relevant agreements, the Community requested authorisation from
the DSB to suspend the application of its tariff concessions and related obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(?GATT?) 1994 to the United States. The United States objected to the level of suspension of tariff concessions and related obligations and
the matter was referred to arbitration. On 26 November 2004, the DSB granted the authorisation to suspend the application to the United
States of tariff concessions and related obligations under GATT 1994 in accordance with the decision of the Arbitrator.
The CDSOA disbursements for the most recent year for which data were available at that time relate to the distribution of anti-dumping and
countervailing duties collected during the fiscal year 2004. On the basis of the data published by the United States' Customs and Border
Protection, the level of nullification or impairment caused to the Community was calculated at USD 27.81 million. The Community was,
therefore, authorised to suspend the application of its tariff concessions to the United States for an equivalent amount.
The effect of a 15 % ad valorem additional import duty on imports of the products in Annex I originating in the United States represented a
value of trade that did not exceed USD 27.81 million. In respect of those products, the Community suspended the application of its tariff
concessions to the United States from 1 May 2005.
CONTENT: on 12 June 2014, the Commission presented a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council codifying
Council Regulation (EC) No 673/2005 of 25 April 2005 establishing additional customs duties on imports of certain products originating in the
United States of America. In its opinion of 17 September 2014 the Consultative Working Party of the legal services stated that the proposal
was confined to a straightforward codification, without any substantive changes to the acts covered by it.
Having regard to the amendment adopted to the proposal, the Commission has decided to an amended proposal for codification of the
Regulation in question.
Additional duty: the amended proposal provides that the tariff concessions and related obligations under GATT 1994 of the Union are
suspended in respect of products originating in the United States listed in Annex I to this Regulation. It provides that an ad valorem duty of 1.5
% additional to the customs duty applicable under Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/9210 shall be imposed on the products originating in the
United States listed in Annex I. This duty will be added to customs duties payable under Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913 establishing the
Community Customs Code.
Annual adjustment: if the non-implementation of the DSB ruling and recommendation persists, the Commission should adjust annually the
level of suspension to the level of nullification or impairment caused by the CDSOA to the Union at that time. The Commission should, whilst
respecting certain criteria, amend the list in Annex I or the rate of the additional import duty so that the effect of the additional duty on imports
from the United States of the selected products represents, over one year, a value of trade that does not exceed the amount of nullification or
impairment (being USD 27.81 million.).
A further amendment aims to add Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/675 to Annex III.

2014/0175(COD) - 23/06/2016 Initial legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to codify Council Regulation (EC) No 673/2005 of 25 April 2005 establishing additional customs duties on imports of certain
products originating in the United States of America.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 673/20056 has been substantially amended several times. In the interests of clarity and
rationality, that Regulation should be codified.
To recall, on 12 June 2014, the Commission presented a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council codifying
Council Regulation (EC) No 673/2005. On 17 July 2015, the Commission presented an amended proposal for the codification of Regulation
(EC) No 673/2005, following subsequent amendments to it.
Having regard to the amendments adopted in respect of Regulation (EC) No 673/2005 and in view of the work already carried out in the
course of the legislative procedure, the Commission has decided to present another amended proposal for codification of the Regulation in
question.
CONTENT: the proposed Regulation stipulates that the tariff concessions and related obligations under GATT 1994 of the Union are
suspended in respect of products originating in the United States listed in Annex I to this Regulation .
An ad valorem duty of 0.45 % additional to the customs duty applicable under Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and
of the Council shall be imposed on the products originating in the United States listed in Annex I to this Regulation.
The proposal recalled that on 27 January 2003, the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) of the World Trade Organization (WTO) adopted the

Appellate Body report and the Panel report, as upheld by the Appellate Body report, finding that the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset
Act (CDSOA) was incompatible with the United States' obligations under the ?WTO? agreements.
In accordance with the decision of the Arbitrator on this issue, on 26 November 2004, the DSB granted the authorisation to suspend the
application to the United States of tariff concessions and related obligations under GATT 1994 in accordance with the decision of the
Arbitrator. On the basis of the data published by the United States' Customs and Border Protection (from 1 October 2003 to 30 September
2004), the level of nullification or impairment caused to the Community was calculated at USD 27.81 million.
Under this draft Regulation, the Commission should adjust the level of suspension annually to the level of nullification or impairment caused by
the United States' Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act (?CDSOA?) to the Union at that time. The Commission should respect certain
conditions. In particular, the level of nullification or impairment shall be equal to 72 % of the amount of disbursements under the CDSOA
relating to anti-dumping and countervailing duties paid on imports from the Union for the most recent year for which data are available at that
time, as published.
DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of
the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

2014/0175(COD) - 04/07/2017 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to submit a new amended proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council codifying Council Regulation
(EC) No 673/2005 establishing on additional customs duties on imports of certain products originating in the United States of America.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: on 12 June 2014, the Commission presented a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council
codifying Council Regulation (EC) No 673/2005 establishing additional customs duties on imports of certain products originating in the United
States of America.
On 17 July 2015, in the light of the amendments made in the meantime, the Commission presented an initial amended proposal for
codification of Regulation (EC) No 673/2005 (see the summary dated the same day).
Having regard to the amendments adopted in respect of Regulation (EC) No 673/2005 and in view of the work already carried out in the
course of the legislative procedure, the Commission has decided to present another amended proposal for codification of the Regulation in
question.
CONTENT: the main elements of the new amended proposal are as follows:
Additional rights: the amended proposal stipulates that the tariff concessions and related obligations under GATT 1994 of the Union are
suspended in respect of products originating in the United States listed in Annex I to this Regulation.
It provides the imposition of an additional 4.35 % ad valorem duty on products originating in the United States listed in that Annex. This duty
would be in addition to the customs duties applicable under Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council
establishing the Union Customs Code.
Annual adjustments: the Commission shall adjust the level of suspension annually to the level of nullification or impairment caused by the
United States' Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act (CDSOA) to the Union at that time.
The Commission shall amend the rate of the additional duty or the list in Annex I under the following conditions:
the level of nullification or impairment shall be equal to 72 % of the amount of disbursements under the CDSOA relating to
anti-dumping and countervailing duties paid on imports from the Union for the most recent year for which data are available at that
time, as published by the United States' authorities;
the amendment shall be made so that the effect of the additional import duty on imports of the selected products originating in the
United States represents, over one year, a value of trade that does not exceed the level of nullification or impairment ($ 27.81 million);
the Commission shall amend the rate of the additional duty when the level of suspension cannot be adjusted to the level of nullification
or impairment by adding or removing products from the list in Annex I.
Another amendment seeks to add the reference to Commission Delegation Regulation (EU) 2017/750 in Annex III.
DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of
the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

2014/0175(COD) - 24/10/2017 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Legal Affairs adopted the report by Ji?í MATÁLKA (GUE/NGL, CZ) on the amended proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council on additional customs duties on imports of certain products originating in the United States of America
(codification).
The committee recommended that the European Parliament adopt its position at first reading, taking over the Commission proposal as
adapted to the recommendations of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the
Commission.
Following the examination of the amended proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council codifying Council
Regulation (EC) No 673/2005, the Consultative Working Party concluded, without dissent, that the proposal is a straightforward codification of

existing texts, without any change in their substance.

2014/0175(COD) - 12/12/2017 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 627 votes to 7, with 20 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the amended proposal for a regulation of
the European Parliament and of the Council on additional customs duties on imports of certain products originating in the United States of
America (codification).
Parliament adopted its position at first reading under the ordinary legislative procedure without making any amendments to the Commission
proposal.
The Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, concluded that the
proposal in question contains a straightforward codification of the existing texts without any change in their substance.
The amended proposal stipulates that the tariff concessions and related obligations under GATT 1994 of the Union are suspended in respect
of products originating in the United States listed in Annex I to this Regulation.
As a result of the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act (CDSOA), the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) of the World Trade Organization
(WTO) granted, on 26 November 2004, the authorisation to suspend the application of such tariff concessions with respect to the United
States.
The codified version of Council Regulation (EC) No 673/2005 provides an ad valorem import duty of 4.3% additional on the products
originating in the United States listed in Annex I to this Regulation. This duty would be added to the customs duty applicable under Regulation
(EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the Union Customs Code.
The Commission shall adjust the level of suspension annually to the level of nullification or impairment caused by the United States' Continued
Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act (CDSOA) to the Union at that time. It shall amend the rate of the additional import duty or the list in Annex I
while respecting the conditions laid down in the Regulation.
