Summary

2014/2690(RSP) - 17/04/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 518 to 27 votes, with 30 abstentions, a resolution prepared by the Committee on Foreign Affairs on EU
foreign policy in a world of cultural and religious differences.
Principles of EU foreign policy: Members reiterate their conviction that, when defending its own interests in the world, the Union must always

base its policies on the promotion of the fundamental values on which it is founded (democracy, the rule of law and human rights, social justice
and the fight against poverty) and on respect for other countries.
They note in particular that the transition towards democracy in numerous states throughout the world in the past two decades, and more
recently the events of the uprisings in the Arab world, have shown that the aspirations for democracy, social justice, human dignity and equal
participation are a universal driving force within and across diverse cultural and religious backgrounds and should not be viewed solely as a
Western concern. They deplore the fact that the notion of cultural and religious differences has repeatedly been instrumentalised to justify
blatant violations of human rights by authoritarian regimes and radical non-state actors.
Members recall that respect for religious freedoms is an important external policy principle, and that they repudiate the advocacy and
dissemination of fundamentalist religious tenets aimed at eroding or violating the rights of particular communities.
Challenges of religious influence in the international political arena: Members consider that the European Union should be more assertive in its
support for the promotion and protection of human rights and social and political rights by civil society. They deplore in passing the fact that, in
many non-European countries, even where diverse religious expressions are tolerated, secularism and atheistic or agnostic views are
nevertheless often subject to legal or social discrimination and that atheists are facing threats, pressure and danger. They propose therefore
that the religious leaders of the three Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) engage in interreligious dialogue, in a spirit of unity
and tolerance.
Credibility, coherence and consistency of EU policy: Members call on all Member States to repeal any existing laws which contradict the
fundamental freedom of religion and conscience and freedom of expression. They reaffirm their support for the inclusion in all EU agreements
with third countries, of reciprocal conditionality and political clauses on human rights and democracy, as a common reaffirmation of the mutual
commitment to these values with appropriate safeguards to ensure that the suspension mechanism cannot be abused by either side.
Recommendations to the European External Action Service (EEAS) and to the Commission: Parliament also calls on the EEAS and the EU
Delegations worldwide to further engage with third countries and regional organisations in the promotion of intercultural and interreligious
dialogue. They call on the EU to make culture an even stronger part of political dialogue with partner countries and regions around the world,
promoting cultural exchanges and systematically integrating culture into development programmes and projects. They stress, in this
connection, the need to streamline the Commissions internal operations within the various DGs which focus on external relations (foreign
policy, enlargement, trade and development), education, culture and the digital agenda. Lastly, Parliament encourages all Heads of EU
Delegations to make full use of digital diplomacy tools through their active and consistent presence in the social media.
