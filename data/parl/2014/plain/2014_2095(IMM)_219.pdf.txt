Summary

2014/2095(IMM) - 24/03/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Legal Affairs adopted the report by Evelyn REGNER (S&D, AT) in which it recommended the European Parliament to
waive the immunity of Viktor USPASKICH (ADLE, LT).
The Prosecutor-Generals Office of the Republic of Lithuania was instructed on 11 June 2014 to ask the European Parliament to waive the
immunity of its Member Viktor Uspaskich to enable the punishment to which Vilnius Regional Court had sentenced him on 12 July 2013 to be
executed.

The Vilnius Regional Court found Viktor Uspaskich guilty of infringing the Lithuanian Criminal Code and was sentenced to four years
imprisonment.
At the appeal stage of the proceedings a further decision by the European Parliament is required because, pursuant to Article 62 of the
Lithuanian Constitution, a Member of the national Parliament (Seimas) may not be held criminally liable without the consent of the Seima.
The criminal proceedings at issue are identical, in terms of content, with the proceedings on the basis of which the European Parliament
decided in 2010 to waive the parliamentary immunity of Viktor Uspaskich. At that time he was charged, in essence, with having, illegally and
with disregard for the duty to monitor properly the financing of the party which he chaired, headed an organised group with the aim of
committing a number of criminal offences. For example, fictitious books were kept in order to conceal revenue and expenditure.
According to Members, Viktor Uspaskich refers to WikiLeaks documents as new evidence, but these documents were already discussed as
part of the defence-of-immunity procedure initiated on 5 April 2011 and they neither constitute conclusive evidence nor are relevant.
The committee noted that once again it has not proved possible to establish any sufficient connection between the new facts adduced and the
procedure against Viktor Uspaskich for false accounting. Moreover, no convincing evidence is available to demonstrate fumus persecutionis
and whereas the offences of which Viktor Uspaskich is accused have nothing to do with his work as a Member of the European Parliament.
In light of the foregoing considerations, the committee recommended that the European Parliament should waive the parliamentary immunity
of Mr Uspaskich.

2014/2095(IMM) - 25/03/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament decided to waive the immunity of Viktor USPASKICH (ADLE, LT).
It is recalled that the request for waiver of the immunity of Viktor Uspaskich was forwarded on 21 July 2014 by the Lithuanian judicial
authorities in connection with criminal proceedings pending before the court of appeal of the Republic of Lithuania.
The Vilnius Regional Court found Viktor Uspaskich guilty of infringing the Lithuanian Criminal Code? He was sentenced to four years
imprisonment.
Both Viktor Uspaskich and the Public Prosecutors Office subsequently appealed, so that the same legal proceedings on the basis of which the
immunity of Viktor Uspaskich has already been waived are now pending on appeal.
At the appeal stage of the proceedings a further decision by the European Parliament is required because, pursuant to Article 62 of the
Constitution of the Republic of Lithuania, a Member of the national Parliament (Seimas) may not be held criminally liable without the consent of
the Seimas.
The Parliament considered that the charges against Viktor Uspaskich do not relate to an opinion expressed or vote cast by him in the
performance of his duties as a Member of the European Parliament and that Article 8 of the Protocol is therefore not applicable.
According to the Members, the facts laid down in the initial accusation remain the same. Once again it has not proved possible to establish any
sufficient connection between the new facts adduced and the procedure against Viktor Uspaskich for false accounting. Moreover, no
convincing evidence is available to demonstrate fumus persecutionis and whereas the offences of which Viktor Uspaskich is accused have
nothing to do with his work as a Member of the European Parliament.
Therefore, Parliament decided to waive the immunity of Mr Uspaskich.
