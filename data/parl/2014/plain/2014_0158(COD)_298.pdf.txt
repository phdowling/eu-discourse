2014/0158(COD) - 27/05/2014 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: codification of Regulation (EEC) No 2841/72 of the Council of 19 December 1972 on the safeguard measures provided for in the
Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Confederation.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and transparency of Union law, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Regulation
(EEC) No 2841/72 of the Council on the safeguard measures provided for in the Agreement between the European Economic Community and
the Swiss Confederation.
Regulation (EEC) No 2841/72 of the Council has been substantially amended several times. It is recalled that in 1987, the Commission
decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement.
The Edinburgh European Council in December 1992 confirmed the importance of codification as it offers certainty as to the law applicable to a
given matter at a given time.
The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an
accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments.
The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it; it fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does
no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself.

2014/0158(COD) - 28/04/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading

The Committee on Legal Affairs adopted the report by Andrzej DUDA (ECR, PL) on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament
and of the Council on the safeguard measures provided for in the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss
Confederation (codified text).
The committee recommended the European Parliament to adopt its position at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure taking
over the Commission proposal as adapted to the recommendations of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European
Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
The Consultative Working Party concluded that the proposal in question contains a straightforward codification of the existing texts without any
change in their substance.
The proposal concerns rules for implementing the safeguard clauses and precautionary measures provided for in Articles 22 to 27 of the
Agreement between the European Economic Community and Switzerland, signed on 22 July 1972.
The implementation of the bilateral safeguard clauses of the Agreement requires uniform conditions for the adoption of safeguard measures.
Those measures should be adopted in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council
(comitilogy).
The Commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases or in the case of export aids that have a
direct and immediate effect on trade, imperative grounds of urgency so require.

2014/0158(COD) - 19/05/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 614 votes to 30 with 30 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council on the safeguard measures provided for in the Agreement between the European Economic
Community and the Swiss Confederation (codified text).
Parliament adopted its position in first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure and approved the Commission proposal without
amendment.
The Consultative Working Party considered the proposal in question contains a straightforward codification of the existing texts without any
change in their substance.
The proposal for the codification of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2841/72 - substantially amended several times concerns detailed rules for
implementing the safeguard clauses and precautionary measures where exceptional circumstances require immediate action, as provided in
the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Confederation, signed in Brussels on 22 July 1972.
The Commission shall be assisted by the Committee on Safeguards established by Regulation (EU) 2015/478 of the European Parliament and
of the Council. That Committee shall be a committee within the meaning of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 (Comitology Regulation).
The Commission shall include information on the implementation of this Regulation in its annual report on the application and implementation
of trade defence measures presented to the European Parliament and to the Council pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009.

2014/0158(COD) - 08/07/2015 Final act
PURPOSE: codification of Regulation (EEC) No 2841/72 of the Council of 19 December 1972 on the safeguard measures provided for in the
Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Confederation.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Regulation (EU) 2015/1145 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the safeguard measures provided for in the
Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Confederation (codification).
CONTENT: Regulation (EEC) No 2841/72 of the Council has been substantially amended several times. In the interests of clarity and
rationality, that Regulation should be codified.
Safeguard clauses: in the framework of an agreement between the European Economic Community and Switzerland signed in Brussels on 22
July 1972, detailed rules are necessary for implementing the safeguard clauses and precautionary measures.
The implementation of the bilateral safeguard clauses of the Agreement requires uniform conditions for the adoption of safeguard measures.
Those measures should be adopted in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council.
In this context, the Commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases relating to situations
referred to in the Agreement or in the case of export aids that have a direct and immediate effect on trade, imperative grounds of urgency so
require. Where necessary, the Commission shall adopt safeguard measures in accordance with the examination procedure.
Regulation (EEC) No 2841/72 is repealed.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 6.8.2015.
