2014/2012(INI) - 19/12/2013 Non-legislative basic document
In a proposal for a recommendation to the Council (tabled pursuant to Rule 121(1) of the Rules of Procedure), Eva JOLY (FR), Catherine
GRÈZE (FR), Keith TAYLOR (UK), Judith SARGENTINI (NL), Bart STAES (BE), Isabella LÖVIN (SE) on behalf of the Greens/EFA Group,
called on the European Parliament to made a series of recommendations to the Council on humanitarian engagement of armed non-state
actors in child protection.
The proposal recalled that most contemporary armed conflicts involve one or more armed non-state actors fighting governments or other
armed groups, with civilians and particularly children bearing the brunt of these wars. In order to improve the protection of civilians, and
particularly children, it is necessary that international humanitarian norms apply to and bind all parties in an armed conflict .
Members recalled that the Statute of the International Criminal Court criminalises the act of conscripting or enlisting children under the age of
15 into armed forces or groups, or using them to participate actively in hostilities. International law prohibits all forms of sexual violence,
including against children.
Members also stated that the international community has a moral duty to seek commitments from all parties involved in conflicts, including
both states and armed non-state actors, in order to protect children. It is for this reason that they addressed the following recommendations to
the Commissioner for Development and the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and
Security Policy:
encourage the signing of action plans for the protection of children in armed conflict with the UN Office of the Special Representative
of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict by concerned states and armed non-state actors;
include in political dialogues with third countries, for instance within the framework of the Cotonou Agreement, the goal of preventing
and stopping the recruitment and forced involvement of children under the age of 18 and ensuring their release and reintegration into
society;
reiterate that states and armed non-state actors must comply with international humanitarian law and international humanitarian
customary law, and support them in their efforts to take special measures to protect civilians, particularly children;
engage directly, or indirectly through specialised NGOs, with armed non-state actors on the issue of protection of girls and boys, with
a view to alleviating childrens suffering in armed conflict;
support humanitarian NGOs that engage in dialogue with armed non-state actors in order to promote respect for international
humanitarian norms in armed conflict.

2014/2012(INI) - 05/03/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Development unanimously adopted the own-initiative report by Judith SARGENTINI (Greens/EFA, NL) with a proposal for a
European Parliament recommendation to the Council on humanitarian engagement of armed non-state actors in child protection.
Members recalled that the Statute of the International Criminal Court criminalises the act of conscripting or enlisting children under the age of
15 into armed forces or groups, or using them to participate actively in hostilities. It is for this reason that the committee called on the
Parliament to address a series of recommendations to the Commissioner for Development and the Vice-President of the Commission/High
Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. They may be summarised as follows:
encourage the signing of action plans for the protection of children in armed conflict with the UN Office of the Special Representative
of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict;
include in political dialogues with third countries, for instance within the framework of the Cotonou Agreement, the goal of preventing
and stopping the recruitment and forced involvement of children under the age of 18 and ensuring their release and reintegration into
society;
reiterate that states and armed non-state actors must comply with international humanitarian law and international humanitarian
customary law, and support them in their efforts to take special measures to protect civilians, in particular children, while recalling that
such activity with armed non-state actors does not imply support for, or recognition of the legitimacy of, these groups or their activities;
engage directly, or indirectly through specialised NGOs and humanitarian organisations, with armed non-state actors on the issue of
the protection of girls and boys, with a view to alleviating child suffering in armed conflict and urging armed non-state actors to sign the
Deed of Commitment under the Geneva Call for the Protection of Children from the Effects of Armed Conflict;
support humanitarian organisations that engage in dialogue with armed non-state actors in order to promote respect for international
humanitarian norms in armed conflict.

2014/2012(INI) - 12/03/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted, without vote, in accordance with Rules 97(4) of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament, a
resolution with a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on humanitarian engagement of armed non-state actors
in child protection.
Parliament recalled that the Statute of the International Criminal Court criminalises the act of conscripting or enlisting children under the age of
15 into armed forces or groups, or using them to participate actively in hostilities. Parliament also recalled that international humanitarian
norms apply to and bind all parties in an armed conflict and that international law prohibits all forms of sexual violence, including against
children.
Parliament addressed a series of recommendations to the Commissioner for Development and the Vice-President of the Commission/High
Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. They may be summarised as follows:
encourage the signing of action plans for the protection of children in armed conflict with the UN Office of the Special Representative
of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict;
recognise the efforts made by the UN and international and non-governmental organisations to persuade armed non-state actors to
protect children, while reiterating that this does not imply support for, or recognition of, the legitimacy of the activities of those actors;
include in political dialogues with third countries, for instance within the framework of the Cotonou Agreement, the goal of preventing
and stopping the recruitment and forced involvement of children under the age of 18 and ensuring their release and reintegration into
society;
reiterate that states and armed non-state actors must comply with international humanitarian law and international humanitarian
customary law, and support them in their efforts to take special measures to protect civilians, in particular children, while recalling that
such activity with armed non-state actors does not imply support for, or recognition of the legitimacy of, these groups or their activities;
engage directly, or indirectly through specialised NGOs and humanitarian organisations, with armed non-state actors on the issue of
the protection of girls and boys, with a view to alleviating child suffering in armed conflict and urging armed non-state actors to sign the
Deed of Commitment under the Geneva Call for the Protection of Children from the Effects of Armed Conflict;
support humanitarian organisations that engage in dialogue with armed non-state actors in order to promote respect for international
humanitarian norms in armed conflict.
Respect of international law: moreover, Parliament recalled that:
that states and armed non-state actors must comply with international humanitarian law and international humanitarian customary law,
and support them in their efforts to take special measures to protect civilians;
international humanitarian law is a legal framework which binds armed non-state groups and that Common Article 3 of the Geneva
Conventions and the Second Additional Protocol of 1977 both serve to this end, as do a large number of customary international
humanitarian law rules.
Lastly, it called for the examination of whether existing rules governing international humanitarian law are adequate to deal with non-state
actors or whether further regulation is needed.
