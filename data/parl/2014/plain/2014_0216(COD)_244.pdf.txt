2014/0216(COD) - 15/07/2014 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: codification of Council Directive 1999/32/EC relating to a reduction in the sulphur content of certain liquid fuels and amending
Directive 93/12/EEC.
PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: Council Directive 1999/32/EC has been substantially amended several times. On 1 April 1987, the Commission decided to
instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The
Conclusions of the Presidency of the Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this, stressing the importance of codification.
The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an
accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments.
CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and rationality, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Directive 1999/32/EC
of 26 April 1999 relating to a reduction in the sulphur content of certain liquid fuels and amending Directive 93/12/EEC.

The new Directive will supersede the various acts incorporated in it; this proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and
hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself.
The proposed Directive seeks to reduce the emissions of sulphur dioxide resulting from the combustion of certain types of liquid fuels and
thereby to reduce the harmful effects of such emissions on man and the environment.
This Directive lays down the maximum permitted sulphur content of heavy fuel oil, gas oil, marine gas oil and marine diesel oil used in the
Union.
With regard to the limit on the sulphur content of heavy fuel oil, the proposal provides for: (i) derogations in Member States and regions where
the environmental conditions allow; (ii) derogations for their use in combustion plants which comply with the emission limit values laid down in
Directive 2001/80/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, or in Annex V to Directive 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and
of the Council.
To recall, in 2008, the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) adopted a resolution to amend Annex VI to the Protocol of 1997 to amend the
International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto (MARPOL),
containing regulations for the prevention of air pollution from ships. The revised Annex VI to MARPOL entered into force on 1 July 2010.
In order to ensure coherence with international law as well as to secure proper enforcement of new globally established sulphur standards in
the Union, the codified Directive should be in line with the revised Annex VI to MARPOL.

2014/0216(COD) - 24/02/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Legal Affairs adopted the report by Laura FERRARA (EFD, IT) on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament
and of the Council relating to a reduction in the sulphur content of certain liquid fuels (codified text).
The committee recommended the European Parliament to adopt its position at first reading, taking over the Commission proposal as adapted
to the recommendations of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
According to the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, the proposal
in question contains a straightforward codification of the existing texts without any change in their substance.
The proposed Directive seeks to reduce the emissions of sulphur dioxide resulting from the combustion of certain types of liquid fuels and
thereby to reduce the harmful effects of such emissions on man and the environment.
In order to ensure coherence with international law as well as to secure proper enforcement of new globally established sulphur standards in
the Union, the codified Directive should be in line with the revised Annex VI to MARPOL.

2014/0216(COD) - 09/03/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 665 votes to 24, with 5 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a directive of the
European Parliament and of the Council relating to a reduction in the sulphur content of certain liquid fuels (codified text).
Parliament adopted its position at first reading, taking over the Commission proposal. This proposal in question aims to codify Council
Directive 1999/32/EC which has been substantially amended several times. The proposal contains a straightforward codification of the existing
texts without any change in their substance.
The proposed Directive seeks to reduce the emissions of sulphur dioxide resulting from the combustion of certain types of liquid fuels and
thereby to reduce the harmful effects of such emissions on man and the environment. It lays down the maximum permitted sulphur content of
heavy fuel oil, gas oil, marine gas oil and marine diesel oil used in the Union.
With regard to the limit on the sulphur content of heavy fuel oil, the proposal provides for: (i) derogations in Member States and regions where
the environmental conditions allow; (ii) derogations for their use in combustion plants which comply with the emission limit values laid down in
Directive 2001/80/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, or in Annex V to Directive 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and
of the Council.
To recall, the Union and the individual Member States are Contracting Parties to the UN-ECE Convention of 13 November 1979 on
Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution. The second UN-ECE Protocol on transboundary pollution by sulphur dioxide stipulates that the
Contracting Parties should reduce sulphur dioxide emissions in line with or beyond the 30 % reduction specified in the first Protocol.
In 2008, the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) adopted a resolution to amend Annex VI to the Protocol of 1997 to amend the
International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto (MARPOL),
containing regulations for the prevention of air pollution from ships.
The revised Annex VI to MARPOL introduces, inter alia, stricter sulphur limits for marine fuel in SOx Emission Control Areas (1,00 % as of 1
July 2010 and 0,10 % as of 1 January 2015) as well as in sea areas outside SOx Emission Control Areas (3,50 % as of 1 January 2012 and, in
principle, 0,50 % as of 1 January 2020).
Most Member States are obliged, in accordance with their international commitments, to require ships to use fuel with a maximum sulphur
content of 1,00 % in SOx Emission Control Areas as of 1 July 2010.
In order to ensure coherence with international law as well as to secure proper enforcement of new globally established sulphur standards in
the Union, the codified Directive should be in line with the revised Annex VI to MARPOL.

2014/0216(COD) - 11/05/2016 Final act

PURPOSE: codification of Council Directive 1999/32/EC relating to a reduction in the sulphur content of certain liquid fuels.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Directive (EU) 2016/802 of the European Parliament and of the Council relating to a reduction in the sulphur content of
certain liquid fuels.
CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and rationality, this Directive codifies and repeals Council Directive 1999/32/EC, which has been
substantially amended several times.
The Directive aims to reduce the emissions of sulphur dioxide resulting from the combustion of certain types of liquid fuels and thereby to
reduce the harmful effects of such emissions on man and the environment. It lays down the maximum permitted sulphur content of heavy fuel
oil, gas oil, marine gas oil and marine diesel oil used in the Union.
Heavy fuel oil and gas oil: Member States shall ensure that the following are not used within their territory:
heavy fuel oils if their sulphur content exceeds 1.00 % by mass;
gas oils if their sulphur content exceeds 0.10 % by mass.
With regard to the limit on the sulphur content of heavy fuel oil, the Directive provides for: (i) derogations in Member States and regions where
the environmental conditions so allow;(ii) derogations for their use in combustion plants which comply with the emission limit values laid down
in Directive 2001/80/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, or in Annex V to Directive 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and
of the Council.
Marine fuel: in 2008, the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) adopted a resolution to amend Annex VI to the Protocol of 1997 to amend
the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto (MARPOL),
containing regulations for the prevention of air pollution from ships.
In order to ensure coherence with international law, the Directive conforms with Annex VI to MARPOL introduces, which entered into force on
1 July 2010. Annex VI to MARPOL introduces, inter alia, stricter sulphur limits for marine fuel in SOx in emission Control Areas (1.00 % as of 1
July 2010 and 0.10 % as of 1 January 2015) as well as in sea areas outside SOx Emission Control Areas (3.50 % as of 1 January 2012 and, in
principle, 0.50 % as of 1 January 2020).
Emission abatement methods: the Directive facilitates access to emission abatement methods. Those methods can provide emission
reductions at least equivalent to, or even greater than, reduction achievable using low sulphur fuel, provided that they have no significant
negative impacts on the environment, such as marine ecosystems, and that they are developed subject to appropriate approval and control
mechanisms.
Sampling and monitoring: in order to ensure the proper implementation of the Directive, Member States must: (i) ensure sufficiently frequent
and accurate sampling of marine fuel placed on the market or used on board ship as well as regular verification of ships' logbooks and bunker
delivery notes; (ii) establish a system of effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties for non-compliance with the provisions of the
Directive.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 11.6.2016.
DELEGATED ACTS: the Commission may adopt delegated acts in respect of the amendment of the equivalent emission values for, and the
criteria for the use of, emission abatement methods laid down in Annexes I and II to the Directive, in order to adapt them to scientific and
technical progress. The power to adopt delegated acts is conferred on the Commission for a period of five years from 17 December 2017
(which may be tacitly extended for the same period). The European Parliament or the Council may raise objections to a delegated act within
three months of notification (which may be extended by three months.) If Parliament or Council raise objections, the delegated act will not
enter into force.

2014/0216(COD) - 28/06/2017 Follow-up document
The Commission presents a report on the exercise of the power to adopt delegated acts conferred on the Commission pursuant to Directive
2016/802/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council relating to a reduction in the sulphur content of certain liquid fuels.
To recall, the Directive empowers the Commission to adopt delegated acts to adapt certain Articles and Annexes to scientific and technical
progress, not least, to ensure consistency with the relevant instruments adopted by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and, as
appropriate, with other EU or international standards.
The power to adopt such delegated acts is conferred on the Commission for a period of five years from 17 December 2012 (which may be
tacitly extended for an identical period).
This report discharges the Commissions obligation to prepare a report in respect of the delegation of power, at the latest 9 months before the
end of the five-year period.
Exercise of the delegation: over the last five years, the Commission has not exercised the delegated powers conferred to it under Directive
2016/802/EU.
This is due to the fact that there have been no significant developments in the area of fuel specifications and sulphur in fuel verification
standards or emission abatement methods that require the Commission to use the delegated powers conferred by the Directive.
However, the entry into force on 1 January 2020, by virtue of the Directive, of the stricter 0.50% sulphur in fuel requirement for ships sailing in
EU waters outside the Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SOx-ECAs) as well as globally, means that new marine fuels and emission abatement
methods may enter the EU market to ensure compliance with the stricter requirement.
Both developments would likely require the Commission to use its delegated powers to ensure the Directive is adapted to scientific and
technical progress, and consistent with standards adopted by the IMO.
