2014/0321(NLE) - 30/10/2014 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to allow Croatia to adhere to the Convention of 29 May 2000, established by the Council in accordance with Article 34 of the
Treaty on European Union, on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union and its Protocol of
16 October 2001.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: the Act of 2011 concerning the conditions of accession of Croatia to the European Union simplified its accession to the
conventions and protocols concluded by the Member States on the basis of Article 34 of the Treaty on European Union. It is no longer
necessary to negotiate and conclude specific accession protocols (which would have to be ratified by the 28 Member States): the Act of
Accession simply state that Croatia accedes to the conventions and protocols by virtue of the Act.
Accordingly, the Council will take a decision determining the date on which these conventions will enter into force in relation to Croatia and
making all the adjustments required by reason of the accession of this new Member State to these conventions (including at the very least the
adoption of the conventions in the Croatian language so that this version can be equally authentic). The Council will act on a recommendation
by the Commission, after consulting the European Parliament.
CONTENT: this proposal recommends the Council to allow Croatia to adhere to the Convention of 29 May 2000, established by the Council in
accordance with Article 34 of the Treaty on European Union, on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the
European Union and its Protocol of 16 October 2001.
N.B.: Annex I of the Act of Accession lists the six conventions and protocols concerned in the area of justice and home affairs.

2014/0321(NLE) - 12/05/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs unanimously adopted the report by Birgit SIPPEL (S&D, DE) on the
recommendation for a Council decision on the accession of Croatia to the Convention of 29 May 2000, established by the Council in
accordance with Article 34 of the Treaty on European Union, on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the
European Union and its Protocol of 16 October 2001.
The Committee recommended that the European Parliament give its consent to the Commission recommendation.
To recall, the Act of 2012 concerning the conditions of accession of the Republic of Croatia to the European Union simplified its accession to
the conventions and protocols concluded by the Member States on the basis of Article 34 of the Treaty on European Union (ex Article K.3
TEU). It is no longer necessary to negotiate and conclude specific accession protocols (which would have to be ratified by the 28 Member
States): Article 3(4) and (5) of the Act of Accession simply state that Croatia accedes to the conventions and protocols by virtue of the Act.
Annex I to the Act of Accession lists the six conventions and protocols concerned in the area of justice and home affairs. The list includes the
Convention of 29 May 2000, established by the Council in accordance with Article 34 of the Treaty on European Union, on Mutual Assistance
in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union.
This Commission Recommendation for a Council Decision is intended to make the adjustments required by reason of the accession of Croatia
to the aforementioned Convention and Protocol, in accordance with Article 3(4) and (5) of the Act of Accession.

2014/0321(NLE) - 10/06/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading

on European Union, on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union and its Protocol of 16
October 2001.
Parliament approved the Commission recommendation which seeks to allow Croatia to adhere to the Convention of 29 May 2000, established
by the Council in accordance with Article 34 of the Treaty on European Union, on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member
States of the European Union and its Protocol of 16 October 2001.
N.B: Annex I to the Act of Accession lists the six conventions and protocols concerned in the area of justice and home affairs.
