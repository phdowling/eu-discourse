Summary

2014/2220(INI) - 19/03/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Foreign Affairs adopted the own-initiative report by Arnaud DANJEAN (PPE, FR) on the implementation of the Common
Security and Defence Policy (based on the Annual Report from the Council to the European Parliament on the Common Foreign and Security
Policy).
Stressing that the current level of instability at the EUs borders and in its immediate neighbourhood was unprecedented since the late 1990s,
Members were concerned that the Union might not jointly be able to be a key player in addressing each of these threats and that it might all
too often be reduced to relying on the initiatives of one or a few Member States, or on ad hoc alliances in which it had only a peripheral or
reserve role to play.
The Union and its Member States must, as a matter of the utmost urgency, adapt to the new security challenges, in particular by (i) making
effective use of the existing CSDP tools, including by linking these better to the EUs foreign affairs tools, humanitarian assistance, and
development policy, (ii) coordinating national actions and pooling resources more closely and, where appropriate, (iii) introducing in a
pragmatic and flexible manner new arrangements for the expression of European solidarity.
Members found regrettable, especially with regard to the increasing external instabilities, the fact that the injection of political stimulus by the
European Council in 2013 did not lead to enhanced cooperation and the substantial and rapid implementation of practical measures.
They considered that the upcoming European Council meeting in June 2015 on defence should take decisions that will lead to the
improvement of the capacity of the Union and the Member States as regards territorial defence, in total complementarity with NATO as well as
their ability to:
respond to internal security challenges;
develop the deployable capabilities needed to ensure a meaningful contribution by the EU to crisis management, strengthen the
European Defence Agency and the European Defence and Industrial Base,
initiate the elaboration of a comprehensive security concept that will integrate the internal and external dimensions of security.
CSDP missions and operations: the report was concerned that the most recent civilian and military operations under the CSDP had continued
to be dogged by structural shortfalls, which had been evident for several years, namely (i) inefficiency as regards immediate reactions to
civilian and military actions, (ii) lengthy and inflexible decision-making processes, (iii) the need for greater solidarity among Member States in
funding missions, (iv) mission mandates which were unsuited to the operational environment, (v) the problem of force generation, and (vi)
logistical and financial inertia.
Members welcomed the Councils intention to initiate a process of strategic reflection on the challenges and opportunities for the foreign and
security policy. They called, furthermore, on the VP/HR to initiate a wide-reaching process to develop an even more ambitious white paper on
European security and defence in order to streamline the EUs strategic ambitions and capability development processes
Members underlined the importance of achieving a common level of cybersecurity among the Member States and called furthermore, for a
coherent European strategy to secure critical (digital) infrastructure against cyber attacks, while also protecting and promoting citizens digital
rights and freedoms.
Capabilities: Members considered that the reduction in national defence budgets due to the effects of the 2008 economic and financial crisis
took place without coordination between the Member States, thus jeopardising the Unions strategic autonomy.
They stressed the importance of:
upfront planning on strategic investment in the purchase and renovation of equipment among Member States;
developing the EU institutional framework both civilian and military in order to implement the European Maritime Security Strategy;
continuing to implement the European Defense Agency (EDA)s code of conduct on pooling and sharing equipment, ensuring the strict
avoidance of duplication of initiatives already underway elsewhere and for greater attention to be paid to the identification of ways in
which real value could be added;
ensuring that such space services, particularly Copernicus, were put on an operational footing to help meet the high-resolution satellite
imaging needs of CSDP missions and operations.
The Union should encourage Member States to meet NATO capacity targets, which require a minimum level of defence spending of 2 % of
GDP and a minimum 20 % share of the defence budget for major equipment needs, including for research and development.
The defence industry: Members believed that all the measures in question depend on the prior joint determination of what falls within the
European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB) so that potential beneficiary companies or strategic activities can be targeted,
with due regard for the capacity differences between the Member States defence industries.

This definition could be based on a number of criteria, such as (i) the development within the EU of equipment and technology, (ii) control by
companies of the property and utilisation rights for the equipment and technology they develop, and (iii) the assurance in the event of foreign
ownership that foreign owners do not have excessive voting rights, which would jeopardise control by companies over their activities.
The Commission was asked to clearly identify and mobilise EU financial means and instruments aimed at assisting in the establishment of a
European Common Defence Industry Market.

2014/2220(INI) - 21/05/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 361 votes to 236, with 54 abstentions, a resolution on the implementation of the Common Security and
Defence Policy (based on the Annual Report from the Council to the European Parliament on the Common Foreign and Security Policy CFSP).
Adapting to emerging security challenges: Parliament considered that the threats such as the conflict in eastern Ukraine, the conflicts in Syria
and Iraq, with the rise of the ISIS terrorist organisation, the Libyan crisis and the terrorist threat in Africa (in particular in the Sahel, Libya and
the Horn of Africa) are direct threats to the Unions security.
Stressing that the current level of instability at the EUs borders and in its immediate neighbourhood was unprecedented since the late 1990s,
Parliament was concerned that the Union might not jointly be able to be a key player in addressing each of these threats and that it might all
too often be reduced to relying on the initiatives of one or a few Member States, or on ad hoc alliances in which it had only a peripheral or
reserve role to play.
The Union and its Member States must, as a matter of the utmost urgency, adapt to the new security challenges, in particular by:
making effective use of the existing CSDP tools, including by linking these better to the EUs foreign affairs tools, humanitarian
assistance, and development policy;
coordinating national actions and pooling resources more closely and, where appropriate;
introducing in a pragmatic and flexible manner new arrangements for the expression of European solidarity.
Parliament found regrettable, especially with regard to the increasing external instabilities, the fact that the injection of political stimulus by the
European Council in 2013 did not lead to enhanced cooperation and the substantial and rapid implementation of practical measures.
It considered that the upcoming European Council meeting in June 2015 on defence should take decisions that will lead to the improvement of
the capacity of the Union and the Member States as regards territorial defence, in total complementarity with NATO as well as their ability to:
respond to internal security challenges;
develop the deployable capabilities needed to ensure a meaningful contribution by the EU to crisis management;
strengthen the European Defence Agency and the European Defence and Industrial Base;
initiate the elaboration of a comprehensive security concept that will integrate the internal and external dimensions of security.
The June 2015 European Council meeting must encourage recalcitrant Member States to invest more resources in defence, and that it must
also focus its efforts on those area of crisis management in which the EU can genuinely add value.
CSDP missions and operations: Parliament was concerned that the most recent civilian and military operations under the CSDP had continued
to be dogged by structural shortfalls, which had been evident for several years, namely (i) inefficiency as regards immediate reactions to
civilian and military actions, (ii) lengthy and inflexible decision-making processes, (iii) the need for greater solidarity among Member States in
funding missions, (iv) mission mandates which were unsuited to the operational environment, (v) the problem of force generation, and (vi)
logistical and financial inertia.
Members welcomed the Councils intention to initiate a process of strategic reflection on the challenges and opportunities for the foreign and
security policy. They called, furthermore, on the VP/HR to initiate a wide-reaching process to develop an even more ambitious white paper on

continuing to implement the European Defense Agency (EDA)s code of conduct on pooling and sharing equipment, ensuring the strict
avoidance of duplication of initiatives already underway elsewhere and for greater attention to be paid to the identification of ways in
which real value could be added;
putting in place EU-level tax incentives for cooperation and pooling;
ensuring that such space services, particularly Copernicus, were put on an operational footing to help meet the high-resolution satellite
imaging needs of CSDP missions and operations.
The Union should encourage Member States to meet NATO capacity targets, which require a minimum level of defence spending of 2 % of
GDP and a minimum 20 % share of the defence budget for major equipment needs, including for research and development.

companies of the property and utilisation rights for the equipment and technology they develop, and (iii) the assurance in the event of foreign
ownership that foreign owners do not have excessive voting rights, which would jeopardise control by companies over their activities.
Members also pointed out that Union programmes in other areas such as internal and border security, disaster management and development
offer a significant prospect of jointly developing capabilities relevant to those policies and to the conduct of CSDP missions.
The Commission was asked to clearly identify and mobilise EU financial means and instruments aimed at assisting in the establishment of a
European Common Defence Industry Market.
