2014/0206(COD) - 02/07/2014 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to codify Council Regulation (EC) No 594/2008 on certain procedures for applying the Stabilisation and Association Agreement
between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, of the other part, and for applying
the Interim Agreement on trade and trade-related matters between the European Community, of the one part, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, of
the other part.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and rationality, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No
594/2008 of 16 June 2008 on certain procedures for applying the
Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Bosnia and
Herzegovina, of the other part, and for applying the Interim Agreement on trade and trade-related matters between the European Community,
of the one part, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, of the other part.
Council Regulation (EC) No 594/2008 has been substantially amended. It is recalled that on 1 April 1987 the Commission decided to instruct
its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement.
The Conclusions of the Presidency of the December 1992 Edinburgh European Council confirmed this, stressing the importance of
codification.
The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an
accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments.
The new proposed Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it; this proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being
codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise
itself.

2014/0206(COD) - 30/01/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Legal Affairs adopted the report by Andrzej DUDA (ECR, PL) on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament
and of the Council on certain procedures for applying the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and
their Member States, of the one part, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, of the other part, and for applying the Interim Agreement on trade and
trade-related matters between the European Community, of the one part, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, of the other part (codified text).
It recommended the European Parliament to adopt its position at first reading taking over the Commission proposal as adapted to the
recommendations of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
According to the Consultative Working Party, the proposal in question contains a straightforward codification of the existing texts without any
change in their substance.

2014/0206(COD) - 29/04/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 628 votes to 53, with 18 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council on certain procedures for applying the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the
European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, of the other part, and for applying the Interim
Agreement on trade and trade-related matters between the European Community, of the one part, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, of the other
part (codified text).
Parliament adopted its position at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure taking over the Commission proposal.
The Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission concluded that the
proposal in question contains a straightforward codification of the existing texts without any change in their substance.
The proposed codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 594/2008 lays down certain procedures for the adoption of detailed rules for the
implementation of certain provisions of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member
States, of the one part, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, of the other part (SAA). The Interim Agreement entered into force on 1 July 2008.
The proposal seeks to:
lay down provisions regulating the management of tariff quotas for fishery products originating in Bosnia and Herzegovina which may
be imported into the Union;
provide that the trade defence measures should be adopted in accordance with the general provisions laid down in Regulation (EU)
2015/478 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Regulation (EU) 2015/479 of the European Parliament and of the Council,
Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 or, as the case may be, Council Regulation (EC) No 597/2009;
state that where a Member State provides information to the Commission on a possible fraud or failure to provide administrative
cooperation, the relevant Union legislation shall apply;
provide that the for the purposes of implementing the relevant provisions of this Regulation, the Commission should be assisted by the
Customs Code Committee;
stipulates that the implementation of the bilateral safeguard clauses of the SAA requires uniform conditions for the adoption of
safeguard and other measures should be adopted in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and
of the Council (comitology);
enable the Commission to adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases relating to exceptional and
critical circumstances, imperative grounds of urgency so require.

2014/0206(COD) - 09/06/2015 Final act
PURPOSE: the codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 594/2008 on certain procedures for applying the Stabilisation and Association

part, and for applying the Interim Agreement on trade and trade-related matters between the European Community and Bosnia-Herzegovina.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Regulation (EU) 2015/940 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 June 2015 on certain procedures for
applying the Interim Agreement on trade and trade-related matters between the European Community, of the one part, and Bosnia and
Herzegovina, of the other part (codified text).
CONTENT: Council Regulation (EC) No 594/2008 has been substantially amended several times. Consequently, in the interests of clarity and
rationality, it was decided to codify the Regulation.
The Regulation lays down the procedures for applying certain measures of the Interim Agreement between the European Community and
Bosnia and Herzegovina on trade and trade-related matters which provided for the early entry into force of the trade and trade-related
provisions of the SAA. The Interim Agreement entered into force on 1 July 2008.
The Regulation specifically seeks to:
lay down the rules governing fishery products originating in Bosnia-Herzegovina may be imported into the Union at a reduced customs
duty, within the limits of tariff quotas;
require that any trade defence measures should be adopted in accordance with the general provisions of Regulation (EU) 2015/478 of
the European Parliament and of the Council, Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 or, as the case may be, Council Regulation (EC)
No 597/2009;
indicate the relevant legislation to apply where a Member State provides information to the Commission on a possible fraud or failure
to provide administrative cooperation;

provide that the Commission should be assisted by the Customs Code Committee;
stipulate that any safeguard measures should be adopted in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European
Parliament and the Council;
provides for full exemption of duties when the preferential rate involves the application of ad valorem duties of 1% or less or specific
duties of EUR 1 or less;
enable the Commission to adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases relating to exceptional and
critical circumstances arising, imperative grounds of urgency so require.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 15.7.2015. Regulation (EC) No 594/2008 is repealed.
