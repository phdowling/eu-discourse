PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the European Training Foundation (ETF) for the
financial year 2013, together with the Foundations reply.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit concerned, amongst others, the annual accounts of the European Training Foundation (ETF).
Statement of assurance: pursuant to the provisions of Article 287 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the Court
has audited:
the annual accounts of the Foundation, which comprise the financial statements and the reports on the implementation of the budget
for the financial year ended 31 December 2013;
the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying those accounts.
Opinion on the reliability of the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the Foundations annual accounts present fairly, in all material respects, its
financial position as at 31 December 2013 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the
provisions of its Financial Regulation and the accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
Opinion on the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the transactions underlying the annual
accounts for the year ended 31 December 2013 are legal and regular in all material respects.
The report also makes a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of the Foundation, accompanied by the latters
response. The main observations may be summarised as follows:
The Courts observations:

budgetary management: at the end of 2013, the Foundation had EUR 7.5 million in accounts at a single bank with a low credit rating.
The Foundations replies:
budgetary management: the Foundation agreed with the Court's finding and confirms its intention to participate in 2014 in a joint
procurement procedure for banking services launched by the Commission. The high bank balance at 31 December 2013 is due to the

Budget: EUR 22 million, of which EUR 19.9 million was funded by a Commission subsidy.
Activities:

Board: supporting EU policies and projects, providing policy analyses, disseminating and exchanging information and experience and
supporting partner-country capacity building, human capital development;

capital development in the EU and its Member States to the context of the partner countries;

education and training (VET) policies and systems, was validated in a corporate conference organised in May with a title Torino
Process: Moving Skills Forward;
responses to direct requests from the European Commission throughout the year.

2014/2104(DEC) - 30/03/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading

The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Ryszard CZARNECKI (ECR, PL) on discharge in respect of the implementation of
the budget of the European Training Foundation (ETF) for the financial year 2013.
The committee recommended that the European Parliament grant the Director of the Foundation discharge in respect of the implementation of
the Foundations budget for the financial year 2013.
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the Foundation for the financial
year 2013 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Members called on the Parliament to approve the closure of
the Foundations accounts. They made, however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is
granted, in addition to the general recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of
EU agencies.
Foundations financial statements: Members noted that the final budget of the Foundation for the financial year 2013 was EUR 20 143
500, representing a decrease of 0.01 % compared to 2012. The entire budget of the Foundation derives from the Union budget.
Carryovers: Members noted that budget monitoring efforts during the financial year 2013 resulted in a budget implementation rate of
99.78%, and that the payment appropriations execution rate was 95.72%. They noted from the Court's report that at the end of 2013,
the Foundation had EUR 7 500 000 in accounts at a single bank with a low credit rating. However, they noted the Foundation's
intention to participate in a joint procurement procedure for banking services launched by the Commission.
Members also made a series of observations on the prevention and management of conflicts of interests, recruitment, procurement
procedures and internal audits.
With regard to performance, the committee acknowledged from the Foundation that the general public was a key target of its communication
activities. It observed that the first level of information on the Foundation's website was aimed at interested citizens and contained general
information, concrete activities and results. The Foundation also used other channels of communication such as social media.
Lastly, Members welcomed the fact that an agreement on the Foundation's premises was concluded with the authorities of the Piedmont
region, in Italy, which ensured the continuation of the Foundation's activities for the 2013-2015 period.
