Summary

2014/2946(RSP) - 19/11/2014 Resolution/conclusions adopted by Council
The Council adopted the conclusions welcoming the Commissions sixth report on cohesion, in which it noted that cohesion policy is the main
investment policy at EU level for pursuing economic, social and territorial cohesion at a time when Europe is facing challenges in terms of
competitiveness, high and persistent unemployment, poverty and social exclusion.
Recalling that in the current programming period cohesion policy continues to play a key role for the re-launch of growth and jobs across the
EU, the Council welcomed the commitment to support growth and jobs. It noted that it supports the incoming Commission's intention to launch
an initiative mobilising EUR 300 billion of additional investment from public and private sources over the period 2015-2017.
The Council called on the Commission and the Member States to accelerate the negotiation and the procedures leading to adoption of all the
Partnership Agreements and all the 2014-2020 Programmes. It stressed the negative impacts that could derive from a late adoption of the
programmes.
The Council stressed the importance of ensuring the availability of the allocated resources, as agreed within the Multi-annual Financial
Framework 2014-2020. It urged the Commission and the Member States to cooperate and explore all the possibilities in order to facilitate the
prompt and timely implementation of the programmes 2014-2020 and to speed up all procedural steps needed to preserve the availability of
the financial resources within the EU budget.
The conclusions also focused on:
the importance of continuing efforts to simplify the implementation of cohesion policy, in order to enhance the result orientation of the
policy and to reduce administrative burdens at all levels;
the need to take account of the cohesion policys role in the context of the Europe 2020 strategy review and its potential contribution to
prepare EU economy for the future;
the need to explore by the Member States opportunities linked to sound and transparent financial instruments and to involvement of
private resources, while minimising the risks and
ensuring that no additional burdens are put in the long-term on public budgets;
the Commission to implement measures to link the effectiveness of ESI Funds to sound economic governance in dialogue with
Member States;
reprogramming which should be used only in cases where it could indeed have a direct impact on the correction of the challenges
identified in the relevant country-specific recommendations under the economic governance mechanisms;
reinforcing the institutional and administrative capacity to ensure the efficiency and the effectiveness of the investments by facilitating
the exchange of good practice and knowledge in that respect;
further analysing and developing the territorial dimension of cohesion policy.
Lastly, the Council recommended that a regular debate in the General Affairs Council takes place among relevant ministers to discuss on the
implementation and results of the European structural and investment funds.

2014/2946(RSP) - 27/11/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 608 votes to 31, with 27 abstentions, a resolution on delays in the start-up of cohesion policy for
2014-2020.
The resolution adopted in plenary was tabled on behalf of the EPP, S&D, ECR, ALDE, GUE/NGL, Greens/EFA and EFDD groups.
Parliament recalled that cohesion policy represents the main EU-wide investment policy in the real economy and is an established catalyst for
growth and jobs in the EU, with a budget of over EUR 350 billion until 2020, targeted at a limited number of strategic goals with
growth-enhancing potential, such as innovation and research, the digital agenda, support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the
low-carbon economy, training, education and infrastructure.
In accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, Partnership Agreements should have been adopted by the end of August 2014 and
Operational Programmes by the end of January 2015 at the latest.
However, there is a clear delay in the programming process, with only a limited number of Operational Programmes (just over 100) expected
to be adopted by the end of 2014.
Two scenarios are envisaged for the adoption of Operational Programmes, both implying further delays as regards the start of implementation,
namely:
(i) the carry-over procedure for those programmes considered ready for adoption by 31 December 2014, and
(ii) the rebudgeting of the unused 2014 allocation for the European Structural and Investment Funds entailing a technical revision of the
multiannual financial framework (MFF) for those considered not ready for adoption by the end of 2014.
According to the timeline presented by the Commission, Operational Programmes could be adopted between 15 February and 31 March 2015
under the carry-over procedure, and after 1 May 2015 under the rebudgeting procedure.

In this context, Parliament expressed its serious concern as regards the significant delay in the implementation of cohesion policy for the
2014-2020 period, while stressing that the current delays are challenging national, regional and local authorities capacity to plan effectively
and implement the European Structural and Investment Funds for the 2014-2020 period.
Implementation of the 2014-2020 programming period: Parliament urged the Commission and the Member States to show responsibility and
do their utmost to speed up the adoption of a maximum number of Operational Programmes in 2014 , and to ensure that as many programmes
as possible are ready for adoption by 31 December 2014 so that they can benefit from the carry-over procedure.
As regards the second scenario, applicable to those Operational Programmes not ready for adoption by the end of 2014, Parliament invited
the Commission to engage as soon as possible in discussions with Parliament and the Council in order to lay out a credible roadmap that
ensures the adoption of the MFF revision as early as possible in 2015.
The Commission is asked to present to Parliament the measures it envisages taking to facilitate, as soon as possible, the implementation of
the Operational Programmes, together with the timeline it envisages.
Backlog in payments: in addition to the delay in implementation for the 2014-2020 programming period, cohesion policy also faces a backlog
in payments amounting to some EUR 23 billion for the 2007-2013 programming period.
Parliament stresses the importance and the urgency of reaching an agreement on the subject, on the basis of new proposals from the
Commission, by the end of 2014.
The Commission is called upon to explain the impact of this delay in payments on the start of implementation of the new Operational
Programmes, and to put forward solutions for limiting the damage as far as possible.
Lastly, Parliament requested that the EUR 315 billion investment package to be announced by the Commission be fully complementary with
the 2014-2020 cohesion policy.
