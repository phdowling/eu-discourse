Summary

2014/2676(DEA) - 03/04/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament decided to raise no objections to Commission delegated regulation supplementing Regulation (EU) No 223/2014 of
11 March 2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD).
This Regulation empowers the Commission to adopt delegated acts as regards the non-essential elements of the FEAD (in terms of

management of data relating to the implementation of the Funds).
Parliament decided to raise no objections to the delegated regulation given that it has repeatedly stressed that it is essential for the Fund for
European Aid to the Most Deprived to become operational without delay.
