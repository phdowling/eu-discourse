2014/2205(INI) - 13/05/2014 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: to propose a framework for action to give a stronger role to the private sector in developing countries.
BACKGROUND: the private sector provides some 90% of jobs in developing countries. It is thus an essential partner in the fight against
poverty.
It is also needed as an investor in sustainable agricultural production if the world is to meet the challenge of feeding 9 billion people by 2050.
Given the private sectors potential for generating inclusive and sustainable growth in developing countries, private stakeholders including
businesses, financial intermediaries, associations and workers and employers organisations are emerging as ever more active in the
development field, both as a source of finance and as partners for governments, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and donors.
A recent evaluation of EU support for private sector development between 2004 and 2010 confirmed the important contribution made by the
Commission to private sector development in partner countries, and identified ways of improving future programmes and strategies, which
include putting more emphasis on decent job creation, mainstreaming private sector engagement across the EUs support portfolio.
Building on these results, this Communication proposes a strategic framework for strengthening the role of the private sector in achieving
inclusive and sustainable growth.
CONTENT: the Communication offers a general framework linking actions by its Member States, development financing institutions and other
development partners.
It provides principles, priorities and action targets as well as an intervention framework for modalities of finance and dialogue.
Principles: EU support to the development of the private sector and its engagement in relation to the local and international private sector will

be guided by the following principles:
putting more emphasis on decent job creation, inclusiveness and poverty reduction;
taking into account the diversity of the private sector in developing countries (individual entrepreneurs, large enterprises, multinational
financial institutions, cooperatives, etc);
market-based solutionsmaking the most of the potential of local enterprises;
the adoption of clear criteria to give direct support to private sector actors, while avoiding market distortions;
taking into account different local contexts and fragile situations in order to ensure the greatest impact and best value for money of EU
support;
putting strong emphasis on results;
observing policy coherence in areas affecting the private sector in partner countries in close coordination between relevant
Commission services and Member States;
at all levels of intervention and investment, the promotion of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) criteria in developing countries.
Priorities for action and action targets: the Communication proposes a series of key actions through which the private sector in developing
countries could be strengthened:
·

creating a business environment conducive to private sector initiativeby providing support for improving the business and investment
climate, especially for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SME);

·

supporting micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in job creation and raising working conditions in the informal economy;

·

empowering women as entrepreneurs;

·

increasing access to finance both for households and micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, to promote inclusive credit,
savings, insurance and inclusive payment services, and microfinance;

·

for all of the actions taken, facilitating public-private partnerships (PPPs) and multi-stakeholder alliances (such as Non-Governmental
Organisations (NGOs).

As regards the action targets, the Commission envisages the following main areas:
agriculture and agri-food,
sustainable energy,
infrastructures and the social sector,
environment and climate change,
migration and risk management,
raw materials and natural resources,
health care and pharmaceutical products,
sustainable tourism,
food.
The Commission will, in line with partner governments policies, develop ways to better integrate private sector development objectives in
support strategies, and will identify modalities for using the private sector as an implementing and financing partner in these areas.
Funding and financial resources: the Commission will use a combination of interventions under its national, regional and thematic programmes
to implement and mainstream its approach to private sector development in its cooperation and development objectives. Implementing the
approach and priorities outlined above will mean adapting existing approaches and tools, and adding new ones to the portfolio of instruments
of EU development cooperation.
In its Communication, the Commission recognises blending, which combines EU grants with loans or equity from other public and private
financiers, as an important vehicle for leveraging additional resources for development and increasing the impact of EU aid. It is working
together with finance institutions on increasing the catalytic effect of blending in crowding in more private financing through greater use of
financial instruments (principally, guarantees, equity and other risk-sharing instruments for infrastructure investments). In this context, the
Commission is also exploring options to expand the scope of blending in new areas such as sustainable agriculture and social sectors.
Lastly, the Commission will continue to seek synergies between budget support and direct interventions for achieving private sector
development objectives. Budget support, and the associated policy dialogue, can usefully underpin business environment reforms in partner
countries by promoting the stability of macroeconomic frameworks, sound public financial management, transparency and oversight of the
budget.

2014/2205(INI) - 26/02/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Development adopted the own-initiative report by Nirj DEVA (ECR, UK) on the private sector and development.
The private sector accounts for 84% of GDP in developing countries and has the capacity to provide a sustainable base for domestic resource
mobilisation, leading to less aid dependency, as long as it is properly regulated.
The committee made the following recommendations:
Long-term strategy for working with the private sector: the report acknowledged that private sector investment in developing countries can
contribute to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals if properly regulated. To this effect, the private sector should commit to
ensuring good governance, poverty reduction and wealth creation through sustainable investment, as well as to reducing inequalities,
promoting human rights and environmental standards and empowering local economies.
All partnerships and alliances with the private sector must:
focus on shared value priorities that align business goals with the EU's development objectives and observe international standards on
development effectiveness;

be co-designed and co-managed with the partner countries in question to ensure that risks, responsibilities and profits are shared, be
cost-effective;
have precise development targets, regular milestones, clear accountability and transparency.
The future partnerships within the 2030 sustainable development agenda must focus more extensively on tackling poverty and inequality.
Support for the local private sector in developing countries: Members noted that micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMMEs) in
developing countries can face much heavier regulatory burdens than those within the EU, and that they lack legal protection and property
rights and operate in the volatile informal economy. They emphasised, in this regard the importance of land registration systems.
The report stressed the need for the EU to:
promote the local private sector in developing countries, e.g. through access to finance and by promoting entrepreneurship;
promote nationally-owned development strategies shaping private sector contributions to development by engaging with the private
sector in a development framework that focuses on domestic cooperatives and SMEs and micro enterprises, in particular smallholder
farmers;
increase support towards partnering with developing countries to modernise their regulatory frameworks by creating a friendly
environment for private initiatives, providing support mechanisms for businesses, while at the same time finding the right balance
between creating a climate conducive to investment and protecting public interests and the environment through regulation;
facilitate the establishment of reliable banking systems and tax administrations in developing countries and strengthen the capacity of
developing countries to mobilise domestic revenue in order to combat tax evasion, corruption and illicit financial flows.
Engaging the European and international enterprise sector for achieving sustainable development: the report called for European development
efforts to play a significant role in the implementation of agreed international standards, such as the UN Guiding Principles on Business and
Human Rights and the International Labour Organisation standards, including working with enterprises and investors to ensure compliance
with the Guiding Principles and the OECD Guidelines on Multinational Enterprise in their business activities and in their supply chains in
developing countries.
Well-designed and efficiently implemented public-private partnerships (PPPs) have the capacity to mobilise long-term private and public
finance, generate innovation in technologies and business models, and incorporate built-in mechanisms to ensure that such partnerships are
held accountable to development results.
PPPs in developing countries are so far mostly concentrated in energy, infrastructure and telecommunications, while the potential in sectors
such as agriculture, water and sanitation, education, green technologies, research and innovation, healthcare and property rights remains
largely untapped.
Agriculture: Members highlighted the vast potential for PPPs in agriculture, under a clearly defined and strong legislative framework for
property rights and land tenure security, to prevent land grabbing and ensure increased and effective agricultural production. The
Commission is urged to couple any PPPs in the agricultural sector involving EU money with comprehensive measures to protect
smallholder farmers, pastoralists and other vulnerable land users against the potential loss of access to land or water.
Green energy: the report recommended that the EU should continue to support renewable and green energy projects in developing
countries, in particular in remote rural areas, in a sustainable manner. Members welcomed the fact that one of the priorities of the
EIB's IFE is investment in energy, widely recognised as a key element in unlocking economic growth in Africa.
Healthcare: the EU should become a facilitator in opening avenues for cooperation beyond access to medicines towards reforming
dysfunctional healthcare systems in developing countries. Support for local SMEs/SMIs can be enhanced not only through financing
instruments, but also through technology transfers, capacity building, sustainable supplier development and business linkages.
Education: the Commission is called upon to facilitate programmes and support PPPs that involve all the stakeholders concerned,
from schools, universities, training centres and private sector actors in order to offer opportunities for training and education that are
relevant to the marketplace.
Steps to be taken: in order to make the private sector a sustainable partner in development policy, Members call for:
the establishment of a clear, structured, transparent and accountable framework governing partnerships and alliances with the private
sector in developing countries;
the setting-up at EU level of sectoral, multi-stakeholder platforms, bringing together the private sector, CSOs, NGOs, think tanks,
partner governments, donors, cooperative organisations, social enterprises and other stakeholders, in order to overcome the
reservations and the lack of trust among partners and resolve the challenges that inadvertently arise from collaborative development
interventions;
the expansion of the current EIB external lending mandate, in order to increase its role in achieving sustainable development and, in
particular, to take a more active part in the new private sector strategy, through blending, co-financing of projects and local private
sector development;
the guarantee that all EU delegations should have trained and qualified staff actively prepared to facilitate and implement partnerships
with private sector actors.
Lastly, the Commission is called upon for a stronger commitment on the part of the Commission, when it comes to leveraging its political
weight and pursuing avenues of dialogue with partner governments and local authorities, to facilitate a greater and more positive interaction
with the private sector.

2014/2205(INI) - 14/04/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 266 votes to 56 with 39 abstentions, a resolution on the private sector and development.
Members recalled that the private sector generates 90 % of jobs and income in developing countries and is the engine of wealth creation and
economic growth in all market economies. According to the United Nations, the private sector accounts for 84% of GDP in developing
countries and has the capacity to provide a sustainable base for domestic resource mobilisation, leading to less aid dependency, as long as it
is properly regulated.

Parliament made the following recommendations:
Long-term strategy for working with the private sector: the report acknowledged that private sector investment in developing countries could
contribute to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals if properly regulated. To this effect, the private sector should commit to
ensuring good governance, poverty reduction and wealth creation through sustainable investment, as well as to reducing inequalities,
promoting human rights and environmental standards and empowering local economies.
All partnerships and alliances with the private sector must:
·

focus on shared value priorities that align business goals with the EU's development objectives and observe international standards
on development effectiveness;

·

be co-designed and co-managed with the partner countries in question to ensure that risks, responsibilities and profits are shared,
be cost-effective;

·

have precise development targets, regular milestones, clear accountability and transparency.

The future partnerships within the 2030 sustainable development agenda must focus more extensively on tackling poverty and inequality.
Nevertheless, Parliament recalled that official development aid (ODA) must remain a key means of eradicating all forms of poverty and of
meeting basic social needs in developing countries, and cannot be replaced by private funding. It called for more public investment in public
services accessible for all, especially in the transport sector, access to drinking water, health and education.
Support for the local private sector in developing countries: 60 % of the developing worlds jobs are in the informal sector in micro, small and
medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) and 70 % of MSMEs receive no financing from financial institutions. Furthermore, 2,5 billion people, a
majority of them women and young people, remain excluded from business communities, the formal financial sector and property and land
ownership opportunities.
Parliament stressed the need for the EU to:
·

promote the local private sector in developing countries, e.g. through access to finance and by promoting entrepreneurship;

·

promote nationally-owned development strategies shaping private sector contributions to development by engaging with the private
sector in a development framework that focuses on domestic cooperatives and SMEs and micro enterprises, in particular
smallholder farmers;

·

increase support towards partnering with developing countries to modernise their regulatory frameworks by creating a friendly
environment for private initiatives, providing support mechanisms for businesses, while at the same time finding the right balance
between creating a climate conducive to investment and protecting public interests and the environment through regulation;

·

facilitate the establishment of reliable banking systems and tax administrations in developing countries and strengthen the capacity
of developing countries to mobilise domestic revenue in order to combat tax evasion, corruption and illicit financial flows.

Engaging the European and international enterprise sector for achieving sustainable development: Parliament called for European
development efforts to play a significant role in the implementation of agreed international standards, such as the UN Guiding Principles on
Business and Human Rights and the International Labour Organisation standards. Europe should work with enterprises and investors to
ensure compliance with the Guiding Principles and the OECD Guidelines on Multinational Enterprise in their business activities and in their
supply chains in developing countries. Members called on the Commission to champion the proposal from investors and other stakeholders to
support binding rules on social, environmental and human rights reporting by business.
Public-private partnerships (PPP): Parliament recognised that PPPs in developing countries are so far mostly concentrated in energy,
infrastructure and telecommunications, while the potential in sectors such as agriculture, water and sanitation, education, green technologies,
research and innovation, healthcare and property rights remains largely untapped.
·

Agriculture: Members highlighted the vast potential for PPPs in agriculture, under a clearly defined and strong legislative framework

dysfunctional healthcare systems in developing countries. Support for local SMEs/SMIs can be enhanced not only through financing
instruments, but also through technology transfers, capacity building, sustainable supplier development and business linkages.

·

Education: in order to close the gap between the education system and the existing job market in developing countries;

The Commission is called upon to facilitate programmes and support PPPs that involve all the stakeholders concerned, from schools,
universities, training centres and private sector actors in order to offer opportunities for training and education that are relevant to the
marketplace.
Principles of engagement with the private sector: Parliament highlighted the fact that engagement with the enterprise sector requires a flexible
approach, and recommended a differentiated approach with regard to least developed countries and fragile states. It called on the
Commission and the Member States to ensure that enterprises involved in development partnerships are aligned with the SDGs and abide by
and respect the principles of corporate social responsibility (CSR). It also stressed the need for EU trade and development policy to observe
the political and economic policy space of developing countries, in particular in least developed countries, to maintain key import tariffs where
needed.
Steps to be taken: in order to make the private sector a sustainable partner in development policy, Members call for:
·

the establishment of a clear, structured, transparent and accountable framework governing partnerships and alliances with the

private sector in developing countries;
·

the setting-up at EU level of sectoral, multi-stakeholder platforms, bringing together the private sector, CSOs, NGOs, think tanks,
partner governments, donors, cooperative organisations, social enterprises and other stakeholders, in order to overcome the
reservations and the lack of trust among partners and resolve the challenges that inadvertently arise from collaborative development
interventions;

·

particular, to take a more active part in the new private sector strategy, through blending, co-financing of projects and local private

partnerships with private sector actors.

Lastly, the Commission was called upon for a stronger commitment on the part of the Commission, when it comes to leveraging its political
weight and pursuing avenues of dialogue with partner governments and local authorities, to facilitate a greater and more positive interaction
with the private sector.
