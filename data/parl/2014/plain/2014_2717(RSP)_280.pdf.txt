Summary

The European Parliament adopted by 497 votes to 121, with 21 abstentions, a resolution on Ukraine.
The resolution was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ECR, ALDE, Greens/EFA groups as well as Valentinas MAZURONIS (EFDD, LT) and Iveta
GRIGULE (EFDD, LV).
Association Agreements (AA) and European perspectives of Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia: Parliament welcomed the signing of the
remaining provisions of the AA, including the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA), and is convinced that it will be a driving
force for political and economic reform, bringing about modernisation, strengthening the rule of law and stimulating economic growth. It
stresses that the AA/ DCFTA is in no way connected to NATO integration.
In addition, Parliament warmly welcomed the signing of the Association Agreements with Georgia and Moldova. It refuted the adoption of
punitive trade measures by Russia against those countries that have signed Association Agreements with the EU, as these agreements do not
pose threats to Russia. It stressed that these moves are in contradiction with World Trade Organisation rules, are politically motivated and are
therefore not acceptable.
It reiterated its view that the AAs with Ukraine and the other EaP countries do not constitute the final goal in their relations with the EU.
Members stressed that, in this connection that, pursuant to Article 49 of the Treaty on European Union, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine like
any other European state have a European perspective and may apply to become members of the Union provided that they adhere to the
principles of democracy, respect fundamental freedoms and human and minority rights and ensure the rule of law.
President Porochenko: Members welcomed the election of President Poroshenko and supported his decisive actions to guarantee the unity,
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. They urged Russia to fulfil its international obligations, to genuinely commit to peaceful
settlement negotiations and to use its real influence to stop any violence. They called for a new meeting of the Trilateral Contact Group on the
settlement in south-eastern Ukraine, and supports new forms of communication between the parties.
Unity of Ukraine: Members reiterated that the international community supports the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and
urged the Ukrainian security forces to fully respect international humanitarian law (IHL) and international human rights law (IHRL) when
conducting so-called anti-terrorist operations. They called on rebels and mercenaries to do the same and not use civilians as human shields.
Parliament condemned Russias aggression on Crimea as a grave violation under international law of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial
integrity and rejected the Russian policy of the fait accompli in foreign relations.
It considered that the annexation of Crimea to be illegal and refused to recognise Russian de facto rule on the peninsula. Parliament is deeply
concerned about the safety of ordinary people who remain trapped in the Donetsk and Luhansk areas and called on Russia to support the
peace plan with true determination.
Sanctions and embargos: Parliament welcomed the extension of the current sanctions to a further 11 people, most of whom are officials of the
so-called separatist authorities. They called for an arms and dual-use technology embargo. It also called for a collective ban on the sale of
arms to Russia and urged its implementation until the situation in eastern Ukraine has normalised. It warned that any further steps by Russia
to destabilise Ukraine will lead to additional and far-reaching consequences for EU-Russian relations.
The European Council is urged to adopt a more coherent and firmer strategy and to speak with one voice vis-Ã -vis the Ukrainian crisis and
the behaviour of the Russian Government, including on matters related to EU energy security. Members deplored the fact that some Member
States are showing disunity in this regard and a lack of EU solidarity.
Independent investigation and reconciliation process: Members called for an independent and impartial investigation of all the deadly events
and crimes against humanity that have taken place in all parts of Ukraine since November 2013, with the inclusion of a strong international
component and under the supervision of the Council of Europe, and for those responsible to be brought to justice. They underlined the need
for confidence-building between various communities in society, and called for a sustainable reconciliation process. They emphasised, in this
context, the importance of establishing an inclusive national dialogue and of avoiding propaganda, hate speech and rhetoric including from
Russia which may further aggravate the conflict. In parallel, they considered that it is of the utmost importance to start a gradual process of
decentralising central powers to regional and municipal administrations without undermining the internal balance of powers or the effective
functioning of the state.
European mission: Parliament welcomed the decision to establish a robust civilian common security and defence policy mission to Ukraine
and called on the VP/HR and the Member States to speed up its deployment. It reiterated its support for President Poroshenkos intention to
hold early parliamentary elections.
Parliament also expressed deep concern over the worsening human rights and humanitarian situation in eastern Ukraine and Crimea (torture,
killings, disappearances of journalists and activists, and hostage taking, including cases of child abduction) and supported the call to establish
a single and regularly updated register of incidents of reported abductions.
Gas supply: lastly, Parliament underlined the need to find a clear, fair and stable solution to ensure the security of gas supply from Russia to
Ukraine, as this is a necessary prerequisite for the economic development and stability of Ukraine. In this regard, the EU should continue to
play its role in facilitating an agreement allowing Ukraine to pay a competitive price, which is not politically motivated, for its gas purchases. It
stressed that the use of energy resources as a foreign policy tool undermines the long-term credibility of Russia as a reliable trading partner
for the EU. It called on the Member States to ensure sufficient gas supply through reverse gas flow from neighbouring states in the EU.
