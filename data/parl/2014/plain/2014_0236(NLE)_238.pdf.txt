2014/0236(NLE) - 28/04/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Development adopted the report by Davor Ivo STIER (EPP, HR) on the draft Council decision on the conclusion, on behalf
of the European Union and its Member States, of the Additional Protocol to the Agreement on Trade, Development and Cooperation between
the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of South Africa, of the other part, to take account of the
accession of the Republic of Croatia to the European Union.
The committee recommended that Parliament give its consent to the conclusion of the Protocol.
The Trade, Development and Cooperation Agreement (TDCA) between the EU and its Member States, on the one part, and the Republic of
South Africa, on the other part, was signed in Pretoria on 11 October 1999 and entered into force on 1 May 2004. It was revised in Kleinmond
(South Africa) on 11 September 2009.
On 1 July 2013, the Republic of Croatia acceded to the EU and became its 28th Member State. The proposed Council decision aims to
approve the Additional Protocol to the EU-South Africa TDCA taking account of Croatia's accession to the EU.
The Additional Protocol only aims to make, into the TDCA, the few technical and linguistic adaptations that Croatia's accession to the EU
necessitates.
