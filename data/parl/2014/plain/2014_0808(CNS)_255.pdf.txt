2014/0808(CNS) - 20/06/2014 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to amend Regulation (EC) No 2533/98 concerning the collection of statistical information by the European Central Bank.
PROPOSED ACT: Recommendation for a Council Regulation.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to
follow its opinion.
BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 2533/98 is a key component in the legal framework supporting the statistical information
collection tasks of the European Central Bank (ECB) assisted by the national central banks (NCB).
The ECB has consistently relied on this Regulation to carry out and monitor the coordinated collection of statistical information necessary to
undertake the tasks of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB), including the task of contributing to the smooth conduct of policies
pursued by the competent authorities relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions and the stability of the financial system.
Council Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013 confers on the ECB specific tasks concerning policies relating to the prudential supervision of credit
institutions and the stability of the financial system within the Union and individual Member States.
To minimise the reporting burden on reporting agents and to enable proper performance of supervision of financial institutions, markets and
infrastructures conferred on all competent authorities, it is necessary to amend Regulation (EC) No 2533/98.
CONTENT: in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 129(4) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and in Article
41 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank, the recommendation presented by the ECB
intends to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 2533/98 concerning the collection of statistical information by the ECB. It aims to:
specify that the ECB, on which specific functions in the field of prudential supervision of credit institutions have been conferred by
Council Regulation 1024/2013, similarly to the NCBs on which specific functions in the field of prudential supervision have been
conferred, may use confidential statistical information for the performance of these functions;
clarify that transmission of confidential statistical information between ESCB members and other authorities of the Member States and
the Union responsible for (a) the supervision of financial institutions, markets and infrastructures, and (b) the stability of the financial

system, to the European Stability Mechanism (ESB) may take place to support to respective tasks.
Authorities may include, inter alia, the competent authorities responsible for supervision and macro-prudential oversight, the European
Supervisory Authorities (ESA), the European Systematic Risk Board (ESRB) as well as authorities authorised to resolve credit
institutions.

2014/0808(CNS) - 12/11/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs adopted in the framework of a special legislative procedure (Parliaments consultation), the
report by Roberto GUALTIERI (S&D, IT) on the draft Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 2533/98 concerning the collection of
statistical information by the European Central Bank.
The committee approved the draft proposed in the recommendation of the European Central Bank (ECB) which aims to amend Regulation
(EC) 2533/98 with a view to taking into account the ECBs new supervisory tasks under Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013 conferring specific
tasks on the European Central Bank concerning policies relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions ( SSM regulation).
It has introduced a number of amendments aiming to clarify the following issues:
any exemption of reporting agents shall be in the form of a motivated written decision. In addition, the decision shall be transparent
and hence public;
the ECB shall respect the principle of proportionality in the definition and imposition of statistical reporting requirements;
the right of verification is not necessarily exhausted with the right to access documents, books and records;
the ECB shall have access to paper and computer databases containing unprocessed data points for the conduct on comparative
statistical analyses;
it is important to distinguish when imposing sanctions the types of misconduct and whether the infringement is intentional or negligent.
Hence, incorrect information should refer to errors and not to intentional falsification or tampering;
the ex-post falsification of data after submission of statistical information should be included amongst the bad faith conducts.
Lastly, Members considered that that such significant empowerment to transmit confidential data to a number of authorities needs to be
balanced by a requirement of the receiving authorities to take all necessary regulatory, administrative, technical and organisational measures
to ensure the physical and logical protection of the confidential statistical information concerned.

2014/0808(CNS) - 26/11/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 541 votes to 98, with 49 abstentions, in the framework of a special legislative procedure (Parliaments
consultation), a legislative resolution on the draft Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 2533/98 concerning the collection of
statistical information by the European Central Bank.
Parliament approved the draft proposed in the recommendation of the European Central Bank (ECB) which aims to amend Regulation (EC)
2533/98 with a view to taking into account the ECBs new supervisory tasks under Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013 conferring specific tasks on
the European Central Bank concerning policies relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions ( SSM regulation).
It has, however, introduced a number of amendments aiming to clarify the following issues:
any exemption of reporting agents shall be in the form of a motivated written decision. In addition, the decision shall be transparent
and hence public;
economic agents may be allowed to submit information through their regular reporting channel;
the ECB shall respect the principle of proportionality in the definition and imposition of statistical reporting requirements;
the right of verification is not necessarily exhausted with the right to access documents, books and records;
the ECB shall have access to paper and computer databases containing unprocessed data points for the conduct on comparative
statistical analyses;
it is important to distinguish when imposing sanctions the types of misconduct and whether the infringement is intentional or negligent.
Hence, incorrect information should refer to errors and not to intentional falsification or tampering;
the ex-post falsification of data after submission of statistical information should be included amongst the bad faith conducts.
Lastly, Parliament considered that that such significant empowerment to transmit confidential data to a number of authorities needs to be
balanced by a requirement of the receiving authorities to take all necessary regulatory, administrative, technical and organisational measures
to ensure the physical and logical protection of the confidential statistical information concerned.

2014/0808(CNS) - 05/03/2015 Final act
PURPOSE: to amend Regulation (EC) No 2533/98 concerning the collection of statistical information by the European Central Bank.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Council Regulation (EU) 2015/373 amending Regulation (EC) No 2533/98 concerning the collection of statistical
information by the European Central Bank
CONTENT: Council Regulation (EC) No 2533/98 is a key component in the legal framework supporting the statistical information collection
tasks of the European Central Bank (ECB) assisted by the national central banks (NCB).
Council Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013 confers on the ECB specific tasks concerning policies relating to the prudential supervision of credit
institutions and the stability of the financial system within the Union and individual Member States.
In the context and on the basis of an ECB recommendation presented on 20 June 2014, this Regulation amends Regulation (EC) No 2533/98
concerning the collection of statistical information by the European Central Bank.

In order to minimise the reporting burden on reporting agents, the Regulation stipulates that the ESCB may transmit confidential statistical
information to authorities or bodies of the Member States and the Union responsible for the supervision of financial institutions, markets and
infrastructures or for the stability of the financial system in accordance with Union or national law, and to the European Stability Mechanism
(ESM), only to the extent and at the level of detail necessary for the performance of their respective tasks.
Those authorities should include the competent authorities responsible for the supervision of financial institutions, markets and infrastructures
and macro-prudential oversight, the European Supervisory Authorities, the European Systemic Risk Board as well as authorities authorised to
resolve credit institutions.
The authorities or bodies receiving confidential statistical information shall take all the necessary regulatory, administrative, technical and
organisational measures to ensure the physical and logical protection of confidential statistical information.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 8.3.2015.
