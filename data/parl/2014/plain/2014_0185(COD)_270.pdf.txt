2014/0185(COD) - 26/06/2014 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to establish a programme on interoperability solutions for European public administrations, businesses and citizens (ISA2
programme).
PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: in its Communication of 19 May 2010 on a Digital Agenda for Europe (DAE), the Commission stressed that interoperability is
essential to maximise the social and economic potential of ICT and that, consequently, the Digital Agenda can take off only if interoperability is
ensured.
As mentioned in its 2013 annual growth survey, the Commission considers the cross-border interoperability of online services and the
digitisation of European public administrations to be important contributors to growth and increased efficiency.
To enable efficient and effective interaction with citizens and businesses, Member States should modernise their administrations and provide
interoperable digital services at national and European level.
However, because it takes place at national level and lacks European-level interoperability, such change very often throws up electronic
barriers (e-barriers) that prevent citizens and businesses from using public services efficiently and impede the smooth functioning of the
internal market.
Activities under the programmes put in place by the Commission since 1995 (IDA, IDABC and ISA) have contributed significantly to ensuring
interoperability in the electronic exchange of information between European public administrations. In its Resolution of 20 April 2012, the
European Parliament recognised the contribution and overarching role of the ISA Programme in defining, promoting and supporting the
implementation of interoperability solutions and frameworks for European public administrations. It also called for an increase in the financial
allocations for interoperability solutions between the EU public administrations for 2014-2020.
With the ISA Programme coming to an end on 31 December 2015, a new EU programme on interoperability solutions for European public
administrations, businesses and citizens is needed.
On 24 and 25 October 2013, the European Council adopted conclusions stressing that the modernisation of public administrations should
continue, with the swift implementation of services, such as e-government, e-health, e-invoicing and e-procurement that rely on
interoperability.
IMPACT ASSESSMENT: based on the 2012 interim evaluation for the ISA Programme, the Commission considers that the adoption of the
new programme will help reduce the cost and administrative burden of cross-border interaction for all concerned, further improve the internal
market and freedom of movement in the EU without administrative e-barriers, and contribute to the swift implantation of ICT systems
supporting EU legislation.
CONTENT: the proposed Decision seeks to establish, for 2016-2020, a programme on interoperability solutions for European public
administrations, businesses and citizens (the ISA2 programme). The proposed programme succeeds the ISA Programme and will consolidate,

promote and expand its activities.
The specific objectives of the programme are as follows:
improve, operate and re-use existing cross-border or cross-sector interoperability solutions;
develop, operate and re-use new cross-border or cross-sector interoperability solutions;
assess the ICT implications of proposed or adopted Union legislation and identify areas in which new legislation could promote
interoperability;
create a European Interoperability Reference Architecture (EIRA) to be used as the tool for building and assessing interoperability
solutions;
create an instrument to facilitate the re-use of existing interoperability solutions and to identify the areas in which such solutions are
still missing;
assess and promote existing common specifications and standards and develop new common specifications and standards;
introduce a mechanism that will measure and quantify the benefits of interoperability solutions.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the financial envelope for implementation of the new ISA2 Programme for the period 1 January 2016 to 31
December 2020 is EUR 130 928 000. The proposed envelope is consistent with the current Multiannual Financial Framework for the years
2014-2020.

2014/0185(COD) - 06/07/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Industry, Research and Energy adopted the report by Carlos ZORRINHO (S&D, PT) on the proposal for a decision of the
European Parliament and of the Council establishing a programme on interoperability solutions for European public administrations,
businesses and citizens (ISA 2) Interoperability as a means for modernising the public sector.
The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, exercising
their prerogatives as associated committees under Rule 54 of Parliaments Rules of Procedure, also gave their opinions on the report.
The committee recommended that the position of the European Parliament in first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure should
amend the Commission proposal as follows:
Subject matter and objectives: Members considered that the new programme should also focus on: (i) the end-user, particularly the needs of
citizens and SMEs; (ii) security, respect for privacy and a high level of data protection; (iii) privacy by default and by design; (iv) administrative
simplification and modernisation; (v) multi-channel delivery, namely maintenance of the possibility to access services by way of traditional
means in addition to electronic means, and the availability of technical support when using electronic means.
The report went on to suggest that the ISA 2 programme:
take into account social, economic and other aspects of interoperability, as well as the specific situation of micro enterprises and
SMEs, in order to improve interaction between European public administrations on the one hand, and businesses and citizens on the
other;
contribute to the development of a more effective, simplified and user-friendly e-administration at the national, regional and local levels
of public administration;
ensure a common understanding of interoperability and evaluate regularly its developments.
Through the ISA 2 Programme, the Union should work with: (i) Member States to identify and promote best practices, to develop guidelines, to
coordinate interoperability initiatives; (ii) industry and civil society and on all issues relevant to support interoperability and its relation to the
better provision of public services.
Common frameworks and solutions established under the ISA 2 Programme should encourage the exploitation of the potential of
e-government and e-democracy and ensure, facilitate and enable both cross-border and cross-sector interoperability.
Activities: the ISA 2 programme shall aim to support and promote, inter alia:
developing common semantics to link public administrations together and connect them to other sectors, thereby providing a way to
make the European economy more competitive overall;
update and promotion of new common specifications and open standards, particularly with regard to the security of data transmission,
processing and storage;
the maintenance and wider publication of a virtual one-stop shop acting as a platform for access and best practice resulting from the
ISA 2 Programme,;
the establishment of a common repository of reusable solutions and standards that is accessible to public administrations or upcoming
projects;
the development of mechanisms to safeguard privacy and security from the perspective of public administrations, citizens, and
businesses.
6 months after the date of entry into force of the Decision, the Commission should develop a communication and training strategy, aiming to
enhance information and to increase awareness with regard to the ISA 2 Programme.
Eligibility and selection criteria: in order to avoid duplication and to speed up the establishment of interoperability solutions, Members proposed
that the results achieved by other relevant Union and Member State initiatives must be taken into account and duplicate solutions must not be
eligible.
The report also contained a new article on implementation rules, which stressed that importance of sharing of experience, the exchange and
promotion of good practices and coordination with other relevant Union initiatives.
This should include a due consideration of the impact of interoperability solutions on privacy and data protection. The sharing of experience
and good practices between all stakeholders and relevant public consultations should be encouraged and facilitated by adequate means, such
as by means of a virtual repository. Particular focus should be placed on the engagement of Member States to secure the cooperation of

national experts on interoperability.
The Commission should bring together relevant stakeholders for the purposes of exchanging views among themselves and with the
Commission on issues addressed by the Programme.
Monitoring and evaluation: when evaluating the ISA 2 Programme the Commission should pay particular attention to whether the solutions
created and implemented have a positive or a negative impact on modernising the public sector and facilitating the needs of citizens and
SMEs, for example by reducing the administrative burden and costs for citizens and SMEs, by creating employment opportunities and by
enhancing the overall interconnection between public administrations on the one hand, and citizens and businesses, in particular SMEs, on the
other.

2014/0185(COD) - 11/11/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 569 votes to 31 with 24 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a decision of the
European Parliament and of the Council establishing a programme on interoperability solutions for European public administrations,
businesses and citizens (ISA 2) Interoperability as a means for modernising the public sector
Parliaments position, adopted in first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure, amended the Commission proposal as follows:
Subject matter and objectives: the Decision establishes, for 2016-2020, a programme on interoperability solutions and common frameworks for
European public administrations, businesses and citizens. It is recalled that Interoperability within local, national and European public
administrations facilitates the achievement of the goals set out by the European Parliament in its resolution of 29 March 2012 on the EU
Citizenship Report 2010: Dismantling the obstacles to EU citizens rights.
The amended text states that the objectives of the ISA2 Programme are to:
develop, maintain and promote a holistic approach to interoperability in the Union in order to eliminate fragmentation in the
interoperability landscape in the Union;
facilitate electronic cross-border or cross-sector interaction between European public administrations on the one hand, and between
European public administrations and businesses and citizens on the other,
identify, create and operate interoperability solutions supporting the implementation of Union policies and activities;
facilitate the re-use of interoperability solutions by European public administrations.
The ISA 2 Programme will take into account:
social, economic and other aspects of interoperability, as well as the specific situation of SMEs and micro-enterprises, in order to
improve interaction between European public administrations on the one hand, and between European public administrations and
businesses and citizens on the other.
ensure a common understanding of interoperability through the European Interoperability Framework (EIF) and its implementation in
Member States administrations.
Amongst the accompanying measures are information, communication of the benefits of the ISA2 Programme, and awareness-raising
measures, aimed at European public administrations and, where appropriate, at businesses and citizens.
Activities: the ISA2 Programme will support and promote, inter alia:
the development, establishment, bringing to maturity, operation and re-use of new cross-border or cross-sector interoperability
solutions and common frameworks ;
the identification of legislation gaps, at Union and national level, that hamper cross-border or cross-sector interoperability;
the development of mechanisms that measure and quantify the benefits of interoperability solutions including methodologies for
assessing cost-savings;
the mapping and analysis of the overall interoperability landscape;
the establishment and promotion of open specifications and standards through the Unions standardisation platforms and in
cooperation with European or international standardisation organisations as appropriate;
the maintenance and publication of a platform allowing access to, and collaboration with regard to, best practices, functioning as a
means of raising awareness and disseminating available solutions, including security and safety frameworks, and helping to avoid
duplication of efforts while encouraging the reusability of solutions and standards;
the identification and promotion of best practices, to develop guidelines to coordinate interoperability initiatives and to animate and
support communities working on issues relevant to the area of electronic cross-border or cross-sector interaction between end users.
9 months after the date of entry into force of the Decision, the Commission must develop a communication strategy, aiming to enhance
information and increase awareness with regard to the ISA2 Programme and its benefits, targeting businesses, including SMEs, and citizens,
and employing user-friendly means on the ISA² Programme's website.
Actions launched under the ISA2 Programme shall comply with the following principles, inter alia: (i) delivery of public services in such a way
as to prevent digital divide; (ii) data protection; (iii) administrative simplification and modernisation; (iv) avoidance of duplication ; (v) solutions
which, insofar as possible, are future-proof .
Prioritisation: actions that meet the eligibility criteria shall be prioritised in accordance with the following prioritisation criteria: (i) the contribution
of the action to the interoperability landscape; (ii) the scope of the action across the sectors concerned; (iii) the geographical reach of the
action; (iv) the urgency of the action; (v) the reusability of the action (vi) the re-use by the action of existing common frameworks and elements
of interoperability solutions; (vii) the link of the action with Union initiatives.
Implementation: the Commission shall bring together relevant stakeholders and organise conferences, workshops and other meetings on
issues addressed by the ISA 2 Programme. The ISA 2 Programme shall build on the sharing of experience and promote community building
activities around frameworks and solutions of common interest, involving relevant stakeholders including non-profit organisations and
universities.

The funding of an action may be suspended or terminated in accordance with the results of monitoring and control and based on an
assessment of whether the action continues to meet the identified needs, and of the effectiveness and efficiency of the action.
