Summary

The European Parliament adopted by 498 votes to 88, with 111 abstentions, a resolution on recognition of Palestine statehood.
The resolution was tabled by the EPP, GUE/NGL, ALDE, S&D and Greens/EFA groups.
Members stated their support in principle recognition of Palestinian statehood and the two state solution, and felt that these should go hand in
hand with advanced peace talks. They decided to launch a Parliamentarians for Peace initiative aiming to bring together cross-party Members
of European, Israeli and Palestinian Parliaments to help advance an agenda for peace and to complement EU diplomatic efforts. Parliament
also reiterated its strong support for the two-state solution on the basis of the 1967 borders, with Jerusalem as the capital of both states, with
the secure State of Israel and an independent, democratic, contiguous and viable Palestinian State living side by side in peace and security. It
underlined that settlements were illegal and called on both parties to refrain from any action that may undermine the viability and the prospects
of the two-state solution.
It condemned in the strongest terms all acts of terrorism or violence, warning particularly about the risks of further escalation of violence
involving holy sites, which could transform the Israeli-Palestinian conflict into a religious conflict. Members wanted to see political leaders from
all sides working together through visible actions to de-escalate the situation.
They went on to support the efforts of the Palestinian national consensus government and urged all Palestinian factions, including Hamas, to
accept the commitments of the PLO and end internal divisions.
Parliament called for continued EU support and assistance for Palestinian institutional capacity-building. It believed that the European Union
should become a genuine actor and facilitator in the Middle East peace process , through a common approach and a comprehensive strategy
for a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It called on the HR/VP to facilitate a common EU position in this regard.
