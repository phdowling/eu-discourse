Summary

2014/0359(NLE) - 09/01/2015 Initial legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to approve, on behalf of the European Union, the Amendment to the 1998 Protocol to the 1979 Convention on Long-Range
Transboundary Air Pollution on Heavy Metals.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: the Union is a Party to the UNECE Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution following its approval in 1981.
The Convention is the main international legal framework for cooperation and measures to limit and gradually reduce and prevent air pollution
and its adverse effects upon human health and the environment in the UNECE region.
To date, the Convention has been extended by eight Protocols, including the 1998 Aarhus Protocol on Persistent Organic Pollutants which
aims to control, reduce or eliminate discharges, emissions and losses of persistent organic pollutants (POPs).
The Parties present at the 31st session of the Executive Body of the UNECE Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution adopted
by consensus Decisions 2012/5 and 2012/6 amending the Protocol to the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution on Heavy
Metals.
Decision 2012/6 entered into force and has become effective. However, Decision 2012/5 requires ratification by the Parties to the Protocol.
CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve, on behalf of the European Union, the Amendment to the Protocol to the
Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution on Heavy Metals.
This Protocol aims to reduce and control anthropogenic emissions into the air of lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd) and mercury (Hg), as harmful heavy
metals subject to long-range transboundary atmospheric transport, with a view to further protecting human health and the environment. In this
respect, it requires Parties to reduce their total annual emissions of lead, cadmium and mercury below their levels in 1990 (or an alternative
year between 1985 and 1995).
The amended Protocol sets out, in particular, stricter emission limit values for dust emissions from certain major stationary sources as well as
flexible transitional arrangements that shall benefit those Parties that will accede the Protocol, as amended, between 1st January 2014 and 31
December 2019.
The amendment to the Protocol is largely covered by current EU law notably via existing emission source control legislation, including
above-mentioned Directive 2010/75/EU and the Commission Implementing Decisions adopted in accordance with this Directive and which
establish the applicable BAT conclusions for various industrial sectors, such as the manufacture of glass and the production of iron and steel,
cement, lime and magnesium oxide and chlor-alkali.
This amendment shall be further transposed in particular via a new Directive setting updated national emission ceilings for certain atmopsheric
pollutants and providing for annual national emission inventories that shall cover, among others, emissions of lead, cadmium and mercury.

2014/0359(NLE) - 02/06/2015 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to approve, on behalf of the European Union, the Amendment to the 1998 Protocol to the 1979 Convention on Long-Range
Transboundary Air Pollution on Heavy Metals.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.

BACKGROUND: the Union is a Party to the UNECE Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution following its approval in 1981.
The Convention is the main international legal framework for cooperation and measures to limit and gradually reduce and prevent air pollution
and its adverse effects upon human health and the environment in the UNECE region.
To date, the Convention has been extended by eight Protocols, including the 1998 Aarhus Protocol on Heavy Metals which seeks to further
protect human health and the environment, including through the updating of emission limit values addressing emissions of air pollutants at
source.
The Union is a party to the 1998 Protocol to the 1979 Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution on Heavy Metals, following its
approval on 4 April 2001.
In 2012, the parties present at the 31st session of the Executive Body of the Convention adopted by consensus Decisions 2012/5 and 2012/6
amending the Protocol. The scope was extended with a view to further improving the protection of human health and the environment,
including through the updating of emission limit values that addressed emissions of air pollutants at source.
The amendments set out in Decision 2012/6 entered into force and became effective, whereas the amendments set out in Decision 2012/5
require acceptance by the parties to the Protocol.
The amendments to the Protocol set out in Decision 2012/5 should therefore be accepted on behalf of the Union,
CONTENT: the Council is invited to approve, on behalf of the European Union, the amendments to the 1998 Protocol to the 1979 Convention
on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution on Heavy Metals.
Scope of the Protocol: this Protocol aims to reduce and control anthropogenic emissions into the air of lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd) and mercury
(Hg), as harmful heavy metals subject to long-range transboundary atmospheric transport, with a view to further protecting human health and
the environment. In this respect, it requires Parties to reduce their total annual emissions of lead, cadmium and mercury below their levels in
1990 (or an alternative year between 1985 and 1995).
The amended Protocol sets out, in particular, stricter emission limit values for dust emissions from certain major stationary sources as well as
flexible transitional arrangements that shall benefit those Parties that will accede the Protocol, as amended, between 1st January 2014 and 31
December 2019.
The amendment to the Protocol is largely covered by current EU law notably via existing emission source control legislation, including
above-mentioned Directive 2010/75/EU and the Commission Implementing Decisions adopted in accordance with this Directive and which
establish the applicable BAT conclusions for various industrial sectors, such as the manufacture of glass and the production of iron and steel,
cement, lime and magnesium oxide and chlor-alkali.
This amendment shall be further transposed in particular via a Directive setting updated national emission ceilings for certain atmospheric
pollutants and providing for annual national emission inventories that shall cover, among others, emissions of lead, cadmium and mercury.

2014/0359(NLE) - 07/01/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety adopted the report by Giovanni LA VIA (EPP, IT) on the draft Council
decision on the acceptance of the Amendments to the 1998 Protocol to the 1979 Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution on
Heavy Metals.
The committee recommended the European Parliament to give its consent to acceptance of the Amendments to the Protocol.
To recall, the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution is intended to protect the human environment against air pollution.
Signed in 1979 and entering into force in 1983, the Convention was the first international legally binding instrument in this area.
The 1998 Aarhus Protocol on Heavy Metals aims to reduce and control anthropogenic emission into the air of lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd) and
mercury (Hg). It requires Parties to reduce their total annual emissions for these three metals below their levels in 1990 or an alternative year
between 1985 and 1995.
The accession of the Community to the 1998 Protocol was approved on behalf of the Community by Council Decision 2001/379/EC. The
Protocol, which entered into force on 29 December 2003, has been transposed into EU law through several instruments.
In December 2012, the Protocol was amended by Decisions 2012/5, 2012/6 and 2012/7.
The amended Protocol sets out, in particular, stricter limit values for dust emissions from certain major stationary sources, as well as flexible
transitional arrangements that shall benefit those Parties that will accede the amended Protocol before the end of 2019, including countries in
Eastern and South-Eastern Europe.
As set out in the short justification in the recommendation, the amendment to the Protocol is already largely covered by EU legislation, and will
be further transposed via a new Directive setting updated national emission ceilings for certain atmospheric pollutants and providing for annual
national emission inventories that shall cover, among others, emissions of lead, cadmium and mercury.
The draft Council Decision lists the text of the amendment to the Protocol via Decision 2012/5 in its Annex. The amendment is fully consistent
with existing EU legislation.
The ratification of the amendment will be an important step towards a higher level of protection of human health and the environment from
transboundary air pollution. Members therefore welcomed the draft Council Decision and proposed that Parliament gives its consent.

2014/0359(NLE) - 02/02/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 617 votes to 25, with 30 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the draft Council decision on the
acceptance of the Amendments to the 1998 Protocol to the 1979 Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution on Heavy Metals.

Following the recommendation from its Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, Parliament gave its consent to acceptance
of the Amendments to the Protocol.
To recall, the 1979 Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution is intended to protect the human environment against air pollution.
The 1998 Aarhus Protocol on Heavy Metals aims to reduce and control anthropogenic emission into the air of lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd) and
mercury (Hg).
