Analysis of the accounts of the European Medicines Agency (EMEA).

with the priorities set by the European Parliament and the Council in the multi-annual financial framework (MFF), the European Commission

The consolidated annual accounts of the EU provide information on the activities of the institutions, agencies and other bodies of the EU from
a budgetary and accrual accounting perspective.
The consolidated reports on the implementation of the general budget of the EU include the budget implementation of all Institutions. Agencies
do not have a separate budget inside the EU budget; and they are partially financed by a Commission budget subsidy.
Each agency is subject to its own discharge procedure.
EMEA: in 2013, the tasks and budget of this agency were as follows:
description of the Agency's tasks: the European Medicines Agency, which is located in London, was created by Council Regulation
(EEC) No 2309/93, which was replaced by Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council and its role is

2014/2102(DEC) - 30/03/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Ryszard CZARNECKI (ECR, PL) on discharge in respect of the implementation of
the budget of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the financial year 2013.
The committee recommended that the European Parliament grant the Executive Director of the Agency discharge in respect of the
implementation of the Agencys budget for the financial year 2013.
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the Agency for the financial
year 2013 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Members called on the Parliament to approve the closure of
the Agencys accounts. They made, however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is
granted, in addition to the general recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of
EU agencies.
Centres financial statements: Members noted that the final budget of the Centre for the financial year 2013 was EUR 251.56,

representing an increase of 13.07 % compared to 2012. The overall contribution of the Union to the Centre's budget for 2013
amounted to EUR 40 937 951.
Commitments and carry-overs: Members noted that budget monitoring efforts during the financial year 2013 resulted in a relatively low
budget implementation rate of 96.76 % and that the payment appropriations execution rate was 83.49%. They noted the Agency's
compliance with the principle of annuality and the timely execution of its budget.
Members also made a series of observations on transfers, procurement and recruitment procedures, internal controls and internal audits and
the prevention and management of conflicts of interest.
They acknowledged from the Agency that the transparency criteria for partner, patient, healthcare and consumer organisations had been
revised during 2014 in order to increase the transparency of funding. They noted the adoption of the document with detailed criteria regarding
the evaluation of financial information from patients, consumers and healthcare professionals organisations. This document was used to
assess the organizations eligibility to participate in the dialogue with the Agency.
The committee regretted that the policies on proactive publication of clinical trial data recently adopted by the Agency went against the
transparency provisions of Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 by allowing companies to redact data based on potential jeopardy of commercial
interests. It called on the Agency to report to the discharge Authority on this issue.

2014/2102(DEC) - 29/04/2015 Final act
PURPOSE: to grant discharge to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the financial year 2013.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision (EU) 2015/1663 of the European Parliament on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of
the European Medicines Agency for the financial year 2013.
CONTENT: with this Decision, the European Parliament gives discharge to the Executive Director of the European Medicines Agency for the
implementation of the Agencys budget for 2013.
The Decision is consistent with the European Parliaments resolution adopted on 29 April 2015 and includes a series of observations that form
an integral part of the discharge decision (refer to the summary of the opinion of 29 April 2015).
Amongst the main observations made, Parliament called on the Agency to ensure complete transparency as regards to the origins of its
budget and to shed light on the recruitment procedures.

2014/2102(DEC) - 29/04/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 556 votes to 110, with 26 abstentions, a decision to grant discharge to the Executive Director of the
European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the financial year 2013. The vote on the discharge decision approved the closure of the accounts (in
accordance with Annex VI, Article 5(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament.
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the Authority for the financial
year 2013 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Parliament adopted by 570 votes to 81, with 29 abstentions,
a resolution containing a number of recommendations that form an integral part of the discharge decision and as well as the general
recommendations that appear in the resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies:
Centres financial statements: Parliament noted that the final budget of the Centre for the financial year 2013 was EUR 251.56 million,
representing an increase of 13.07% compared to 2012. The overall contribution of the Union to the Centre's budget for 2013
amounted to EUR 40 937 951.
Commitments and carry-overs: Parliament noted that budget monitoring efforts during the financial year 2013 resulted in a relatively
low budget implementation rate of 96.76% and that the payment appropriations execution rate was 83.49%. It noted the Agency's
compliance with the principle of annuality and the timely execution of its budget.
Parliament also made a series of observations on transfers, procurement and recruitment procedures, internal controls and internal audits and
the prevention and management of conflicts of interest. It acknowledged from the Agency that the transparency criteria for partner, patient,
healthcare and consumer organisations had been revised during 2014 in order to increase the transparency of funding.
Transparency and data confidentiality: Parliament regrets that the policies on proactive publication of clinical trial data recently adopted by the
Agency go against the transparency provisions of Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 of the European Parliament and the Council1 (the Clinical
Trials Regulation) by allowing companies to redact data based on potential jeopardy of commercial interests. It notes with regret that the
Agency's understanding of what constitutes commercial confidential information (CCI) is far too broad and includes companies to redact key
data about the trial design, methods. It called on the Agency to properly implement the provisions of the Clinical Trials Regulation especially
with regard to clinical trial data not to be considered CCI.
Parliament also called on the Agency to publish on its website detailed reports of the scientific advice provided by the Agency to
pharmaceutical companies during the drug development and pre-registration process at the time of trial authorisation and in any case not later
than 12 months after the end of the trial.
Lastly, it noted that advice provided by regulators to companies on drug development and pre-registration plans cannot be considered CCI
since there is an overriding public interest in disclosure.
