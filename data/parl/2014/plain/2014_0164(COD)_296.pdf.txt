2014/0164(COD) - 28/05/2014 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 452/2003 of 6 March 2003 on measures that the Community may take in relation to the
combined effect of anti-dumping or anti-subsidy measures with safeguard measures.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 452/2003 has been substantially amended several times. It is recalled that in 1987, the
Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum
requirement. The Edinburgh European Council in December 1992 confirmed the importance of codification as it offers certainty as to the law
applicable to a given matter at a given time.
The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an
accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments.
CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and transparency of Union law, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council
Regulation (EC) No 452/2003 on measures that the Community may take in relation to the combined effect of anti-dumping or anti-subsidy
measures with safeguard measures.
The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it; it fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does
no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself.
The proposed Regulation establishes specific provisions to enable the Commission, where it considers it appropriate, to take action to avoid
that a combination of anti-dumping or anti-subsidy measures with safeguard tariff measures on one and the same product could place an

undesirably onerous burden on certain exporting producers seeking to export to the Union, which may have the effect of denying them access
to the Union market.
The Commission may consider it appropriate to: (i) amend, suspend or repeal antidumping and/or anti-subsidy measures or: (ii) provide for
exemptions in whole or in part from any anti-dumping or countervailing duties which would otherwise be payable, or: (iii) adopt any other
special measures.
Any suspension or amendment of, or exemption from, anti-dumping or anti-subsidy measures should be granted only for a limited period of
time.

2014/0164(COD) - 14/11/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Legal Affairs adopted the report by Andrzej DUDA (ECR, PL) on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament
and of the Council on measures that the Union may take in relation to the combined effect of antidumping and anti-subsidy measures with
safeguard measures (codified text).
It recommended the European Parliament to adopt its position at first reading, taking over the Commission proposal as adapted to the
recommendations of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
The Consultative Working Party stated that the proposal in question contains a straightforward codification of the existing texts without any
change in their substance.

2014/0164(COD) - 11/02/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 636 to 51, with 13 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation of the European
Parliament and of the Council on measures that the Union may take in relation to the combined effect of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy
measures with safeguard measures (codified text).
Parliament adopted its position at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure taking over the Commission proposal as adapted to
the recommendations of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
According to the Consultative Working Party, the proposal in question contains a straightforward codification of the existing texts without any
change in their substance.
The proposed regulation establishes specific rules to enable the Commission, where it considers it appropriate, to take action with a view to
ensuring that a combination of anti-dumping or anti-subsidy measures with safeguard tariff measures on the same product does not place an
undesirably onerous burden on certain exporting producers seeking to export to the Union, which may have the effect of denying them access
to the Union market.

2014/0164(COD) - 11/03/2015 Final act
PURPOSE: to codify Council Regulation (CE) n° 452/2003 on measures that the Community may take in relation to the combined effect of
anti-dumping or anti-subsidy measures with safeguard measures.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Regulation (EU) 2015/477 of the European Parliament and of the Council on measures that the Union may take in relation
to the combined effect of anti-dumping or anti-subsidy measures with safeguard measures (codification).
CONTENT: this Regulation codifies and repeals Council Regulation (EC) n° 452/2003 which has been substantially amended several times.
The importation of certain goods may be subject to both anti-dumping or anti-subsidy measures on the one hand and safeguard tariff
measures on the other. The new Regulation has specific provisions to enable the Commission, where it considers it appropriate, to take action
with a view to ensuring that a combination of anti-dumping or anti-subsidy measures with safeguard tariff measures on the same product does
not impose on exporting producers seeking to export to the Union onerous burdens and to ensuring that they continue to have access to the
Union market.
Where the Commission considers that a combination of anti-dumping or anti-subsidy measures with safeguard tariff measures on the same
imports could lead to effects greater than is desirable in terms of the Union's trade defence policy, it may adopt:
measures to amend, suspend or repeal existing anti-dumping and/or anti-subsidy measures;
measures to exempt imports in whole or in part from anti-dumping or countervailing duties which would otherwise be payable;
any other special measures considered appropriate in the circumstances.
Any amendment, suspension or exemption shall be limited in time and shall apply only when the relevant safeguard measures are in force.
In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers are conferred on the Commission.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 16.4.2015.
