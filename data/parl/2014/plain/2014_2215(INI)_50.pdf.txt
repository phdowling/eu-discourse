2014/2215(INI) - 26/11/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Petitions adopted a joint own-initiative report by Roberta
METSOLA (EPP, MT) and Ska KELLER (Greens/EFA, DE) on the Special Report of the European Ombudsman in own-initiative inquiry
OI/5/2012/BEH-MHZ concerning Frontex.
The report was adopted in line with Article 55 of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament on the procedure with joint committee
meetings.
Parliament recalled that Frontex, like any other EU institution, body, office or agency, has to comply in its activities with the Charter of
Fundamental Rights.
Against this background, in 2012 the European Ombudsman opened an own-initiative inquiry into the implementation by Frontex of its
fundamental rights obligations. It further issued a Special Report, in which the implementation of an individual complaints mechanism was
insisted upon.
Frontex's operational cooperation with the competent authorities of partner countries is conducted through working arrangements which are
not legally binding and fall outside the scope of international law, and whose practical implementation is not to be regarded as fulfilment of
international obligations by Frontex and the EU. This situation constitutes an element of legal uncertainty which may be seen as in
contradiction with Frontex's human rights obligations.
Frontex and the Member States have shared but distinct responsibilities regarding the actions of the officers deployed in Frontex operations
and pilot project. Most participants in Frontex operations are guest officers sent by Member States other than that hosting the Frontex
operation, in support of that operation.
Members noted that Frontex has already established an incident reporting system which involves internal complaints received from Frontex
staff and guest officers, and consequently does not cater for direct complaints by individuals claiming a breach of their fundamental rights.
Therefore, Member considered that Frontex should set up an individual complaints mechanism.
Ombudsman report: Members welcome the Special Report of the European Ombudsman in the framework of the own-initiative inquiry
concerning Frontex and supported the recommendation by the European Ombudsman that Frontex should deal with individual complaints
regarding infringements of fundamental rights in the course of its operations and should provide adequate administrative support for that
purpose.
They expressed deep concern at the legal vacuum that surrounds the deployment of third-country officers during joint return operations. They
believed that in view of the ever-growing humanitarian and legal challenges at the EUs external borders and the strengthening of Frontex
operations there is a need for a mechanism that is capable of processing individual complaints about alleged breaches of fundamental rights
occurring in the course of Frontex operations or cooperation with third countries, thus becoming a first-instance body for complaints. They
noted that such a mechanism would be compliant with EU law and the principle of good administration and would reinforce the effective
implementation of the Agencys fundamental rights strategy.
Structure of the individual complaints mechanism: in general, Members considered that it is a legitimate expectation to believe that the actions
of those involved in Frontex operations are attributable to Frontex and more generally to the EU. They stressed the need for an official central
structure within Frontex for the processing of individual complaints and recommended that the office of the Frontex Fundamental Rights Officer
should play a crucial role in handling complaints (notably in terms of checking the admissibility of complaints).

Lodging and admissibility of complaints: Members took the view that persons who consider they have been harmed by border guards wearing
the Frontex emblem should have the right to submit a complaint. Frontex is urged to guarantee full confidentiality. They acknowledged that
safeguards are needed to prevent misuse of the complaints mechanism and that anonymous complaints should not be accepted.
However, this does not exclude complaints submitted by third parties acting in good faith in the interest of a complainant.
They suggested that only complaints based on violations of fundamental rights as protected by EU law should be admitted .
Members emphasised the need for clear criteria for the admissibility of complaints and recommended the creation of a standardised complaint
form which should be accessible in languages that migrants and asylum seekers understand and should available both in
smartphone-compatible electronic format on its website. Frontex should set a reasonable time limit for the submission of a complaint.
Complaints against guest officers: Members acknowledged that potential complaints may refer to the conduct of guest officers who fall under
the particular authority of a Member State but wear the Frontex emblem. They considered it crucial to involve national ombudsmen or any
other relevant bodies competent for fundamental rights that are empowered to investigate national authorities and officials, given that the
Fundamental Rights Officer does not have the right to do so.
Members recalled that the Frontex Disciplinary Procedure may also apply to seconded guest officers and seconded national experts if the
relevant Member State agrees. They also considered that the possibility of withdrawing financial support from Member States or the
suspension of a Member State from joint operations in case of serious fundamental rights violations should be explored.
General considerations: lastly, the report noted the general conditions as regards the complaints mechanism. Members insisted therefore on
creating effective information campaigns and a well-structured admissibility check on complaints.
Members insisted on the need for Frontex to:
be adequately equipped and staffed to handle the complaints received including the necessary additional resources for this purpose;
inform the European Parliament about the use of funds by Frontex;
establish close cooperation with the European Ombudsmas in order to improve the protection of individuals from possible acts of
maladministration regarding the activities of Frontex;
ensure special protection of unaccompanied minors, women who are victims of gender-based persecution, LGBTI persons and other
vulnerable groups;
provide publicly accessible information on the complaints mechanism;
include provisions on the individual complaints mechanism in the forthcoming review of the Frontex Regulation.

2014/2215(INI) - 02/12/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 488 votes to 114, with 33 abstentions, a resolution on the Special Report of the European Ombudsman
in own-initiative inquiry OI/5/2012/BEH-MHZ concerning Frontex.

such a mechanism would be compliant with EU law and the principle of good administration and would reinforce the effective implementation
of the Agencys fundamental rights strategy. They stressed that this lack of transparency applies in particular in the case of Frontex's working
arrangements, over which Parliament cannot exercise democratic scrutiny.
Structure of the individual complaints mechanism: in general, Parliament considered that it is a legitimate expectation to believe that the
actions of those involved in Frontex operations are attributable to Frontex and more generally to the EU. It stressed the need for an official
central structure within Frontex for the processing of individual complaints and recommended that the office of the Frontex Fundamental Rights

Parliament suggested that only complaints based on violations of fundamental rights as protected by EU law should be admitted . It also
emphasised the need for clear criteria for the admissibility of complaints and recommended the creation of a standardised complaint form
which should be accessible in languages that migrants and asylum seekers understand or may be reasonably supposed to understand and
should available both in smartphone-compatible electronic format on its website. Frontex should set a reasonable time limit for the submission
of a complaint.
Complaints against guest officers: Parliament acknowledged that potential complaints may refer to the conduct of guest officers who fall under
the particular authority of a Member State but wear the Frontex emblem. It considered it crucial to involve national ombudsmen or any other

relevant Member State agrees. They also considered that the possibility of withdrawing financial support from Member States or the
suspension of a Member State from joint operations in case of serious fundamental rights violations should be explored.
Parliament also recommends that:
gender-based training should be mandatory for both Frontex staff and guest officers before joining a Frontex operation, notably in
order to raise awareness concerning gender-based violence;
Frontex cooperate closely not only with the national border authorities but also with the national human rights bodies.
General considerations: lastly, the resolution noted the general conditions as regards the complaints mechanism. Members insisted therefore
on creating effective information campaigns and a well-structured admissibility check on complaints.
Furthermore, Parliament insisted on the need for Frontex to:
be adequately equipped and staffed to handle the complaints received including the necessary additional resources for this purpose;
inform the European Parliament about the use of funds by Frontex;
establish close cooperation with the European Ombudsmas in order to improve the protection of individuals from possible acts of

ensure special protection of unaccompanied minors, women who are victims of gender-based persecution, LGBTI persons and other
vulnerable groups;
provide publicly accessible information on the complaints mechanism;
include provisions on the individual complaints mechanism in the forthcoming review of the Frontex Regulation;
ensure that the use of funds by Frontex is regularly reported on to Parliament and made public on the Frontex website.
It should be noted that a motion for a replacement resolution, tabled by the ENF group, was rejected in plenary.
