Summary

The European Parliament adopted a resolution on the situation in Libya.
The text adopted in plenary was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ECR, ALDE, Greens/EFA and EFDD groups.
Parliament strongly condemned the sharp escalation of violence in Libya, particularly targeting civilians and called on all parties to the conflict
to accept the freeze in military operations proposed by UN Special Representative Bernardino Le√≥n in order to create a favourable
environment.
It called on all sides involved in the violence to commit to an unconditional ceasefire and reiterated its strong and full support for the United
Nations Support Mission in Libya. Parliament also called on the EU to support these efforts by immediately enacting its own targeted sanctions
, including asset freezes and travel bans, for those responsible for armed violence and human rights violations.
It reiterated its support for the House of Representatives in Tobruk as the sole legitimate body emanating from the June 2014 elections.
Deeply concerned by the increasing presence of Al-Qaeda-linked terrorist groups, Islamic State militias and other extremist organisations and
movements in Libya, Parliament recalled the EUs strong commitment to the unity and territorial integrity of Libya and the need to prevent the
spread of terrorism.
Stressing the destabilising impact of the Libyan conflict on other countries in the Sahel region as well as on European security, the resolution
called on neighbouring countries and regional players, especially Egypt, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the UAE, to refrain from actions
which might exacerbate current divisions and undermine Libyas democratic transition.
Parliament emphasised the following issues:
the need for a common and coordinated action by the Member States under the supervision of the High Representative, to coordinate
Member States action and focus their support on statebuilding and institution-building and to assist in the creation of effective and
nationally commanded and controlled security forces (armed forces and police forces) that can ensure peace and order in the country,
as well as supporting the initialling of a ceasefire and designing a mechanism to monitor it; as well as giving priority to assisting with
reform of the Libyan justice system;
consideration to be given to establishing a UN Commission of Inquiry or similar mechanism to investigate violations of human rights
and international humanitarian law;
guaranteeing the safety and freedom of Christians and other religious minority groups who are facing increasing discrimination and
persecution and find themselves in the crossfire and the need to ensure that future bilateral agreements include effective monitoring
mechanisms for the protection of the human rights of religious minorities;
preserving the neutrality of key Libyan institutions, notably the Central Bank, the National Oil Corporation and the sovereign wealth
fund, which are authorised by the UN to receive oil revenues from abroad;
Members reiterated their concern as regards the proliferation of weapons, ammunition, explosives and smuggling of arms, which poses a risk
to the population and to the stability of Libya and of the region.
Lastly, Parliament reiterated its call on the High Representative to review the mandate of the European Union Border Mission (EUBAM) in
Libya, currently on hold and stationed in Tunisia, in order to take account of the dramatically changed situation in the country, and with a view
to designing a properly coordinated Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) mission to operate in articulation with the UN and regional
partners in the event that a political settlement is found.
That CSDP mission should be aimed at supporting the implementation of a political settlement, should give priority to security sector reform
(SSR) and disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration (DDR) and should also respond to other urgent needs of governance.
In the face of prolonged war in Libya and deepening instability and serious threats to European security, the CSDP mission should be
prepared to participate in a UNSC-mandated and coordinated action to stabilise Libya.
