Summary

2014/2014(IMM) - 30/01/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Legal Affairs adopted the report by Bernhard RAPKAY (S&D, DE) in which it recommended the European Parliament to
defend the immunity and privileges of Lara COMI (EPP, IT).
To recall, Lara Comi, MEP, requested the defence of her parliamentary immunity in response to a summons to appear before the Court of
Ferrara with which she was served on 1 October 2013 in respect of an action for damages brought in connection with statements allegedly
made by her during a televised political debate.

This request, which related to criminal proceedings, was followed by a second request from Ms Comi, submitted on 16 October 2013 in
response to a summons, served on her on 1 October 2013, to appear in civil proceedings for damages based on the same facts as those
criminal proceedings. The two requests to defend Ms Comis immunity concern the same facts (see procedure file IMM/2013/2190).
Ms Comi exercised her right to be heard on both matters by the Committee on Legal Affairs at its meeting of 5 November 2013.
Given that Ms Comi was invited to the television broadcast in her capacity as a Member of the European Parliament to discuss issues of
general interest (public procurement and organised crime) in which she had always taken an interest at European level, the Committee on
Legal Affairs recommended the European Parliament to defend the immunity and privileges of Lara COMI, as it did during the previous request
for defense of immunity in January 2014.

2014/2014(IMM) - 04/02/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading

Given that Ms Comi was invited to the television broadcast in her capacity as a Member of the European Parliament to discuss issues of
general interest (public procurement and organised crime) in which she had always taken an interest at European level and that the opinions
were expressed in the performance of her duties as a Member of Parliament, Members considered that the immunity and privileges of Lara
COMI should be defended.
