Summary

2014/2531(RSP) - 06/02/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a resolution on the situation in Syria.
The resolution was tabled by the ECR, ALDE, S&D, EPP, Greens/EFA and EFD groups. It strongly condemned the widespread violations of
human rights by the Assad regime, and also condemned any human rights abuses by armed groups opposing the regime. It supported the
EUs call on all foreign fighters in Syria, including Hezbollah, to withdraw immediately, and to cease all external funding and support. Members
expressed concern at the increasing involvement of extremist Islamist groups and foreign fighters in the conflict in Syria, and the continued
internal divisions within the opposition. They continued to encourage the National Coalition of Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces to
create a more united, inclusive and organised opposition front both internally and externally.
Parliament fully supported the Geneva II Conference on Syria, and stressed the fundamental importance of keeping the Geneva II process
going. A lasting solution to the current crisis in Syria could only be achieved through a Syrian-led, inclusive political process with the backing of
the international community. Parliament reiterated its call for President Assad to step aside. It stressed the crucial importance of
confidence-building measures and wanted agreement on local ceasefires, the lifting of sieges on certain urban areas, including Homs, the
release or exchange of prisoners and the facilitation of humanitarian access to civilians in need, as stepping stones to substantive negotiations
on the basis of the Geneva Communiqué.
It welcomed the USD 2.4 billion in pledges raised in Kuwait and welcomed also the commitments made by the EU and its Member States, as
the biggest donor in terms of financial aid and future pledges. However, further significant efforts were required in order to meet the
humanitarian needs in Syria, and Parliament called, therefore, for additional financial contributions from international actors.
Members stressed that alleviating the suffering of millions of Syrians in need of basic goods and services must be a priority for the EU and the
international community at large. The crisis in Syria required a coherent common approach by the EU and its Member States in the field of
humanitarian aid delivery and beyond, and Parliament continued to support VP/HR Catherine Ashton and Commissioner Kristalina Georgieva
in their efforts to ensure better coordination in this field.
It called on Russia and China, as permanent members of the UNSC, to fulfil their responsibilities and facilitate the adoption of a humanitarian
resolution. The EU and its Member States must live up to their humanitarian responsibilities and increase their assistance to Syrian refugees,
and coordinate their efforts more effectively in this field. Parliament condemned the consistent thwarting of attempts to deliver humanitarian aid
and called on all parties involved in the conflict, and in particular the Assad regime, to facilitate the provision of humanitarian aid across
borders and conflict lines. It highlighted the fact that deliberate starvation of civilians and attacks on health facilities are prohibited under
international law and would be considered war crimes.
Parliament paid tribute to host communities and to Syrias neighbouring countries, but reiterated its grave concern regarding the humanitarian,
social, economic, political and security impact of the Syrian crisis on the entire region, especially Lebanon and Jordan. It reiterated its calls for
the EU to convene a humanitarian conference on the Syrian refugee crisis, with priority being given to actions directed at host countries in the
region so as to support them in their efforts to host ever-growing refugee populations and maintain an open-door policy.
Parliament moved to call for the following:
·

the establishment of safe havens along the Turkish-Syrian border, and possibly within Syria, and for the creation of humanitarian
corridors by the international community;

·

the immediate, unconditional and safe release of all political prisoners, medical personnel, humanitarian workers, journalists,
religious figures and human rights activists, including 2011 Sakharov Prize winner Razan Zeitouneh, and for coordinated EU action
to secure her release;

·

strengthening civil society actors in Syria, and of the active and meaningful participation of women, young people and civil society
representatives in the Geneva II process and in the rebuilding of the country;

·

all actors providing protection to particularly vulnerable groups in Syrian society, such as ethnic and religious minorities, including
Christians, in the current crisis, and of their participation in the Geneva II process,

·

zero tolerance with regard to the killing, abduction and recruitment of children in particular;

·

special attention to be paid to the situation of Palestinian refugees in Syria, and particularly the alarming humanitarian situation in the
Yarmouk refugee camp;

·

the UNSC to refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court for a formal investigation and for the Vice-President / High
Representative (VP/HR) to take action in this direction;

On the matter of Syrias chemical weapons, Members were concerned at reports that, by the end of January 2014, only 5 % of Syrias chemical
weapons stockpile had been removed from the country for destruction, and urged the Syrian authorities to abide by the timetable laid down in
UNSC resolution 2118 (2013).
