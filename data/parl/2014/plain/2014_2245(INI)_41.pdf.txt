2014/2245(INI) - 23/07/2014 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: to present the 6th report on economic, social and territorial cohesion: investment for jobs and growth.
BACKGROUND: the crisis has had a profound impact on national and regional budgets availability across all investment areas. In the EU as a

whole, public investment declined by 20% in real terms between 2008 and 2013. In Greece, Spain and Ireland, the decline was around 60%.
In the central and eastern European countries, where Cohesion Policy funding is particularly significant, public investment (measured as gross
fixed capital formation) fell by a third. Without cohesion policy, investments in the Member States most affected by the crisis would have fallen
by an additional 50%.
The crisis also led to increases in poverty and social exclusion. For example, in 210 of the 277 EU regions, there was an increase in
unemployment between 2007 and 2012. In 50 of these regions, the unemployment rate more than doubled. The situation is particularly
worrying for young people as, in 2012, youth unemployment rate was over 20% in about half the regions. As a result, many regions have not
yet been able to contribute to meeting the Europe 2020 headline target of 75% employment in the population aged 20-64 by 2020.
This Communication summarises the achievements of cohesion funding in the programming period 2007-2013. It describes the main elements
of the cohesion policy reform introduced for the period 2014-20, and the trends emerging from the ongoing programme negotiations between
the Commission and Member States.
CONTENT: in its report, the Commission sets out the effect of cohesion policy investments between 2007 and 2012:
·

the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) created nearly 600,000 jobs, invested in 200,000 small and medium-sized
enterprise (SME) projects and 80,000 start-ups, financed 22,000 projects involving research and business sector cooperation,
provided broadband coverage to 5 million people and connected 5.5 million people to waste water treatment;

·

the European Social Fund (ESF) supported 68 million individual project participations, ensured 5.7 million unemployed or inactive
people became employed, and saw more than 400.000 reported cases of new start-ups and people becoming self-employed.

The effects of these investments will increase over the next few years as Member States have until the end of 2015 to use the funds from the
2007-13 programmes.
With a total budget of over EUR 450 billion (including national co-financing) for the 2014-20 programming period, Cohesion Policy will be the
main investment arm of the EU. It will provide the largest contribution to supporting SMEs, R&D and innovation, education, the low carbon
economy, the environment, the fight against unemployment and social exclusion, to developing infrastructure connecting EU citizens and to
modernising public administrations.
Evolution of cohesion policy: while remaining true to its roots, cohesion policy has developed and progressed. In its early years, the policy had
a purely national focus, financing predetermined projects in Member States, with little European influence. Over time, key principles were
introduced such as multi-annual programming, more strategic investment and greater involvement of regional and local partners.
The bulk of financial support under the policy has consistently focused on less developed regions and Member States. There has, however,
been a shift of investment away from infrastructure and towards SME support, innovation, more innovative employment and social policies.
By tailoring investments according to levels of economic development, cohesion policy has been able to adjust to the changing needs of each
region over time.
However, the evolution of the policy has not been as decisive as might have been expected. Evidence suggests, for example, that the
introduction in 2007-13 of compulsory earmarking of part of funding to EU priorities was a step forward, but results have been mixed and funds
are still spread too thinly.
It has also become increasingly clear that the effectiveness of cohesion policy depends on sound macro-economic policies, a favourable
business environment and strong institutions. Gaps have also remained when it comes to transposing EU legislation into national law in areas
directly related to cohesion policy.
Lastly, implementation of the funds has focused more on spending and compliance with management rules than on achieving objectives.
Setting targets is complex and some Member States have set targets which were not ambitious enough. This has limited the capacity to
evaluate the effects of interventions and to understand which measures were most effective and why.
The new programming period 2014-2020: bearing these observations in mind, several factors have re-directed the new cohesion policy:
·

better governance: in order to avoid unsustainable fiscal or economic policies that undermine the effectiveness of EU support during
the 2014-20 period, funding may be suspended when a Member State does not comply with the recommendations it received under
the EU economic governance process;

·

maximising added value: Member States and regions need to concentrate funding on a limited number of areas of EU relevance. A
large share of the ERDF will be allocated to four priorities at the centre of the Europe 2020 strategy: innovation and research, the
digital agenda, support for SMEs and the low-carbon economy. ESF concentration on up to five investment priorities will support the
consolidation of outputs and results at European level. At least 20% of the ESF budget will be ring-fenced for supporting social
inclusion and combating poverty and discrimination ;

·

policy based on results: when designing programmes, Member States and regions must specify the results they intend to achieve by
the end of the programming period. Each programme will have a performance framework to increase transparency and
accountability. To provide an additional incentive, approximately EUR 20 billion (or 6% of the Cohesion Policy budget) has been set
aside, to be allocated in 2019 to those programmes which show they are on track to deliver their objectives;

·

a stronger voice to cities: around half of ERDF will be spent in cities in 2014-20. The new cohesion policy also aims to empower
cities to design and implement policies that contribute to meeting the Europe 2020 objectives, by setting a minimum amount (5% of
ERDF) for integrated investment in sustainable urban development ;

·

include partners at all levels: the 2014-20 policy framework is based on the premise that all partners at national, regional and local
levels, respecting the principles of multi-level governance and including social partners and civil society organisations, will be
involved at all stages of programming.

The new programming period brings, therefore, a clear shift in terms of funding priorities compared to 2007-13. Member States and regions
will invest more on the ERDF priorities (R&D and innovation, ICT, SMEs, and low-carbon economy) and on the ESF priorities (employment,

social inclusion, education, and governance). In turn, less money will be invested in network and environmental infrastructure. The decrease of
investment in infrastructure is particularly marked in more developed Member States. These are the first elements emerging from negotiations
with Member States and regions in the first phase of programming.
Follow-up: the Commission states that it will submit an initial progress report on the programmes to the European Parliament and Council in
2017. This will give an overview of progress by Member States and regions towards the objectives set in their programmes, indicating whether
or not they are delivering the intended results.

2014/2245(INI) - 27/05/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Regional Development adopted the report by Tamás DEUTSCH (EPP, HU) on Investment for jobs and growth: promoting
economic, social and territorial cohesion in the Union.
Members began by recalling the determining role of EU cohesion policy in reducing regional disparities, and promoting economic, social and
territorial cohesion among the regions of Member States. They also recalled that the policy was an established tool for growth and jobs, with a
budget of over EUR 350 billion until 2020
In this context, Members analysed the achievements and challenges of cohesion policy during the previous programming period (2007-2013),
underlining that cohesion policy funding was equivalent to 21 % of public investment in the EU as a whole and to 57 % in the cohesion
countries taken together.
They highlighted that cohesion policy had proven its capacity to react quickly with flexible measures to tackle the investment gap for Member
States and regions, such as redirecting 13 % of total funding (EUR 45 billion) to support economic activity and employment with direct effects.
Members considered it essential, therefore, to carry out a substantial in-depth medium-term review of objectives and funding levels in line with
any developments affecting the social and economic situation of the Member States or any of their regions.
Whilst welcoming the recent reforms to cohesion policy, Members stressed that the policy must be aligned closely with sectoral policies and
synergies achieved with other EU investment schemes. Furthermore, they pointed out that although cohesion policy had softened the impact
of the crisis, regional disparities remained high and that the cohesion policy objective to reduce economic, social and territorial disparities,
providing special support to less developed regions, had not yet been reached everywhere.
Implementation and payment problems: expressing serious concern about the significant structural delays in the start-up of the cohesion policy
programming periods, Members noted that this delay might increase the pressure on payments, especially in 2017 and 2018. They remarked
on the regrettable backlog in payments, amounting to EUR 25 billion for the 2007-2013 programming period. They recalled that the issue of
the persistent payments backlog concerned cohesion policy more than any other EU policy area, with EUR 24.8 billion of unpaid bills at the
end of 2014 for the European Social Fund (ESF), the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the Cohesion Fund (CF) 2007-2013
programmes, i.e. a 5.6 % increase compared with 2013. The committee encouraged the Commission to use all available means to cover these
outstanding bills. The Commission was reminded of its commitment to put forward a payment plan as soon as possible, and in any event
before the presentation of the 2016 draft budget.
As a general point, Members underlined that the aforementioned backlog under Heading 1b of the EU budget was in fact the most important
immediate factor endangering the implementation of cohesion policy, both in the previous and, prospectively, in the current 2014-2020
programming period. They stressed that it was imperative to start the implementation of the Operational Programmes as soon as they were
adopted, in order to maximise the results. The Commission should do its utmost to speed up the implementation of the Operational
Programmes, especially in order to avoid decommitments of funds in 2017.
Cohesion policy at the core of smart, sustainable and inclusive investments 2014-2020: Members welcomed the new European Fund for
Strategic Investment (EFSI) and its potential leverage effect. However, there must be enhanced coordination and consistency among all EU
investment and development policies, particularly cohesion policy. Nevertheless, they warned that the EFSI should not undermine the strategic
coherence and long-term perspective of cohesion policy programming. The flexibility allowed in selecting projects for EFSI funding posed a
risk that investments were channelled to more developed Member States, undermining the economic, social and territorial cohesion.
Effectiveness, efficiency and performance orientation of cohesion policy 2014-2020: the committee called on Member States and the
Commission to ensure coherence between National Reform Programmes and Operational Programmes with the aim of addressing the
Country Specific Recommendations adequately and of providing full alignment with the economic governance procedures, thus limiting the risk
of early reprogramming.
They recalled, in this context, Parliaments initial opposition, and demanded that the Commission and the Council provide full, transparent and
timely information on the criteria for, and on the entire procedure that could trigger reprogramming or a suspension of commitments or
payments of, the ESIF. Members considered that the decision on the suspension of commitments or payments should be taken as a last
resort.
They pointed out that irregularities in the implementation of cohesion programmes stemmed to a considerable degree from complex
requirements and regulations. These could be reduced through the simplification of management and procedures, and early transposition of
the newly adopted relevant directives.
Employment, SMEs, youth and education: Members emphasised the key role of SMEs in job creation and points to their potential for
promoting smart growth and the digital and low-carbon economies. They called for a favourable regulatory environment for running of such
enterprises, underlining that SMEs made up 99 % of the EUs corporate fabric and accounted for 80 % of jobs in the Union. The committee
expressed its concern over the too low ceiling (EUR 5 million) set by the Commission on ERDF support to small-scale cultural and sustainable
tourism infrastructures. It also recalled the alarming rates of youth unemployment and insisted that advancing the integration of young people
into the job market must remain a top priority, which required the integrated use of the ESF, the ERDF, the Cohesion Fund and the Youth
Employment Initiative (YEI).
Governance of the policy and the territorial dimension: Members emphasised that cohesion policy needed to be conducted within the spirit of
properly functioning multi-level governance associating regional and national governments. They recommended that cohesion policy resources

and knowledge be used to bolster the administrative capacity of public authorities in a significant way, especially at local and regional levels,
so that their ability to offer quality services to the public is improved. They called on the Commission not to approve programmes in which the
involvement of partners has not been sufficient, as detailed in the Code of Conduct.
Members went on to stress the need for the inclusion of all the cross-border and macro-regional aspects in an integrated and territorial
approach to cohesion policy. This approach was essential, in particular when it came to environmental and energy matters. A territorial
approach should also be taken into account regarding urban issues, given the importance of cities in the globalised economy and their
potential impact in terms of sustainability. Members also called for closer coordination between cohesion policy, the Instrument for
Pre-accession and the EU Neighbourhood Policy
Cohesion policy in the long-term perspective: the report recalled, in view of all of its main recommendations, the necessity for a new dynamic
to be given to the EU cohesion policy debate . It stated that the 2019 European Parliament election year would be decisive, as the then
newly-elected Parliament, and new Commission, would have to deal with the termination of the Europe 2020 strategy and an upcoming new
MFF.
Lastly, Members called on the Commission to consider pre-financing in order to facilitate the full use of funds by the Member States concerned
in the 2014-2020 period, while always ensuring that the principle of budgetary accountability was upheld. Member States were asked to
conduct regular, high-level political debate within national parliaments on the effectiveness, efficiency and timely implementation of the ESIF
and on the contribution of cohesion policy to the fulfilment of macroeconomic objectives.

2014/2245(INI) - 09/09/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 552 votes to 76 with 68 abstentions a resolution responding to the Commissions sixth report on
economic, social and territorial cohesion entitled Investment for jobs and growth: promoting development and good governance in EU regions
and cities of 23 July 2014
Parliament recalled the determining role of EU cohesion policy in reducing regional disparities, and promoting economic, social and territorial
cohesion among the regions of Member States. They also recalled that the policy was an established tool for growth and jobs, with a budget of
over EUR 350 billion until 2020

States and regions, such as redirecting 13 % of total funding (EUR 45 billion) to support economic activity and employment with direct effects.
Parliament considered it essential, therefore, to carry out a substantial in-depth medium-term review of objectives and funding levels in line
with any developments affecting the social and economic situation of the Member States or any of their regions.
Whilst welcoming the recent reforms to cohesion policy, Parliament stressed that the policy must be aligned closely with sectoral policies and
synergies achieved with other EU investment schemes. Furthermore, it pointed out that although cohesion policy had softened the impact of
the crisis, regional disparities remained high and that the cohesion policy objective to reduce economic, social and territorial disparities,
providing special support to less developed regions, had not yet been reached everywhere .
Parliament called on all actors to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of the implementation of the new legislative framework for cohesion
policy and to establish properly functioning, multilevel governance and coordination mechanisms to ensure consistency between programmes,
support to the Europe 2020 strategy and the Country Specific Recommendations.
Implementation and payment problems: expressing serious concern about the significant structural delays in the start-up of the cohesion policy
programming periods, Members noted that this delay might increase the pressure on payments, especially in 2017 and 2018. They remarked
on the regrettable backlog in payments, amounting to EUR 25 billion for the 2007-2013 programming period. They recalled that the issue of

coherence and long-term perspective of cohesion policy programming. The flexibility allowed in selecting projects for EFSI funding posed a
risk that investments were channelled to more developed Member States, undermining the economic, social and territorial cohesion.
Parliament highlights the need to ensure the additionality of EFSIs resources and, hence, the complementarity and synergy between it and
ESIF. It also underlined that cohesion policy legislation provides for the extended use of financial instruments in order to double their
contribution to about EUR 25-30 billion in 2014-2020 by extending their thematic scope and offering more flexibility to Member States and
regions. It highlighted the role of financial instruments in mobilising additional public or private co-investments in order to address market
failures.
Effectiveness, efficiency and performance orientation of cohesion policy 2014-2020: Parliament highlighted the importance of all measures
aimed at increasing the effectiveness, simplification, efficiency, and result and performance orientation of cohesion policy. It called on the
Member States and the Commission to ensure coherence between National Reform Programmes and Operational Programmes with the aim

of addressing the Country Specific Recommendations adequately and of providing alignment with the economic governance procedures, thus
limiting the risk of early reprogramming. It recalled, in this context, Parliaments initial opposition, and demanded that the Commission and the

newly-elected Parliament, and new Commission, would have to deal with the termination of the Europe 2020 strategy and an upcoming new
MFF.
It stressed the crucial importance of administrative capacities and called on policy makers at all governance levels to favour targeted technical
assistance for the implementation of cohesion policies in general, and in particular for the extended use of financial instruments in combination
with the ESIF.
Lastly, Parliament called on the Commission to consider pre-financing in order to facilitate the full use of funds by the Member States
concerned in the 2014-2020 period, while always ensuring that the principle of budgetary accountability was upheld. Member States were
asked to conduct regular, high-level political debate within national parliaments on the effectiveness, efficiency and timely implementation of
the ESIF and on the contribution of cohesion policy to the fulfilment of macroeconomic objectives.
