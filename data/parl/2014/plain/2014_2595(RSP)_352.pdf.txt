Summary

The European Parliament adopted a resolution on the situation in Ukraine.
The resolution was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ALDE, Greens/EFA, ECR, and EFD groups.
It welcomed the democratic spirit and resilience of the Ukrainian people after two months of courageous protests which had met with a brutal
response from the authorities, and expressed its support for the peoples efforts for an independent Ukraine and its European perspective.
Members called strongly for a political solution to the crisis, and stated that any forcible crackdown or declaration of a state of emergency
would be considered as a criminal act and a violation of fundamental rights with profound international consequences . They condemned the
escalation of violence against peaceful citizens, and called on the Ukrainian authorities to fully respect peoples civil rights and fundamental
freedoms, demanding that President Yanukovych cease the shameful deployment of Berkut riot police and other security forces in provoking,
kidnapping, harassing, torturing, beating and humiliating supporters of the EuroMaidans, as well as arbitrary arrests and over-extended
pre-trial detentions. Parliament also called on the Maidan protesters to refrain from the use of force and to maintain the legitimacy of their
cause in a peaceful way. Members regretted that the amnesty law turning victims into hostages was approved on 29 January 2014 without the
consent of the opposition and took the view that an unconditional release of protesters would greatly facilitate the talks and appease society.
Following numerous requests by ordinary Ukrainian citizens, Parliament felt that the active involvement of Members of the European
Parliament in Kyiv could prevent a further escalation of the crisis and called for the establishment of a permanent European Parliament
mission in Ukraine with a view to defusing tension and facilitating dialogue between the parties. It instructed the Conference of Presidents to
set up this mission as soon as possible, and stressed the need for the continued engagement of the EU to mediate and facilitate a process
leading to a de-escalation.
In addition, the resolution called for the EU institutions and Member States to take immediate action, including increased diplomatic pressure
and the preparation of personalised targeted measures (travel sanctions and asset and property freezes) with regard to all those Ukrainian
officials and legislators and their business sponsors (oligarchs) who are responsible for the crackdowns on and deaths of protestors, and to
step up efforts to stop money laundering and tax evasion by Ukrainian companies and business people in European banks.
At the same time, Members called for the EU, the US, the IMF, the World Bank, the EBRD and the EIB to continue to prepare a long-term
package of concrete financial support to help Ukraine tackle its worsening financial and social situation.
Furthermore, the EU institutions and the Member States were asked to commit to a broad opening to Ukrainian society, in particular through a
swift agreement on a cost-free visa regime and ultimately a visa-free regime . The visa fee should immediately be drastically reduced for young
Ukrainians, along with strengthened research cooperation, expanded youth exchanges and increased availability of scholarships.
Members considered that further efforts should be made to include Ukraine in the EUs energy market through the Energy Community. They
underlined the fact that it is for the Ukrainian people and only for them to decide, free from foreign interference, on the geopolitical orientation
of the country and on which international agreements and communities Ukraine should join. In this respect, the resolution called on Russia to
adopt a constructive attitude and to stop retaliatory measures and undue pressure aimed at undermining the sovereign right of its neighbours
freely to determine their future. The EU and its Member States must speak to Russia with one voice in support of the European aspirations of
the Eastern Partnership (EaP) countries that freely choose to deepen their relations with the EU.
