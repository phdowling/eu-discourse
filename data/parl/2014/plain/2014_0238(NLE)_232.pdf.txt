2014/0238(NLE) - 02/09/2014 Initial legislative proposal

PURPOSE: to conclude a Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and Senegal and the Implementation
Protocol thereto.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: the Council authorised the European Commission to negotiate, on behalf of the European Union, the renewal of the
Agreement between the Government of Senegal and the European Economic Community on fishing off the coast of Senegal, which entered
into force on 1 June 1981, and a Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution.
At the end of the negotiations, a new draft Agreement and Protocol were initialled by the negotiators on 25 April 2014.
It is now necessary to conclude the draft Agreement and the Protocol on behalf of the European Union.
CONTENT: the new Fisheries Partnership Agreement lays down the following:
Main objectives of the Agreement: the main aim of the new Agreement is to provide an updated framework taking into account the priorities of
the reformed Common Fisheries Policy and its external dimension, with a view to establishing a strategic partnership between the European
Union and Senegal in the field of fisheries.
The aim of the Protocol is to grant fishing opportunities to European Union vessels in Senegalese waters taking into account available
scientific assessments, in particular those of the Fishery Committee for the Eastern Central Atlantic (CECAF), and in accordance with the best
available scientific advice and the recommendations of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), within
the limits of the available surplus.
The aim is also to enhance cooperation between the EU and Senegal to promote a sustainable fisheries policy and sound exploitation of
fisheries resources in the Senegalese fishing zones, in the interests of both parties.
Fishing opportunities: the Protocol provides for fishing opportunities in the following categories:
28 tuna seiners;
8 pole-and-line vessels;
2 trawlers (targeting black hake, a deep-sea demersal species).
Financial contribution: the annual financial contribution has been set at:
EUR 1 808 000 for the first year,
EUR 1 738 000 for the second, third and fourth years,
EUR 1 668 000 for the fifth year,
based on:
1. a reference tonnage of 14 000 tonnes for tunas and a volume of authorised catches of 2 000 tonnes for black hake, the amounts
linked to such access having been set at EUR 1 058 000 for the first year, EUR 988 000 for the second, third and fourth years, and at
EUR 918 000 for the fifth year; and
2. support for the development of the sectoral fisheries policy of Senegal amounting to EUR 750 000 per year.
This support meets the objectives of the national fisheries policy and in particular the needs of the Republic of Senegal in terms of support for
scientific research, for monitoring and fighting against illegal fishing, and for small-scale fishing, including the rehabilitation of degraded
ecosystems to allow the recovery of juvenile stocks.
Duration of the Agreement: the new Agreement repeals and replaces the existing Agreement; it covers a period of five years from its entry into
force, renewable by tacit agreement. The new Protocol covers a period of five years from the date on which it was signed by the parties.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the financial statement annexed to the draft Agreement sets out an overall amount of EUR 9.61 million in
commitment and payment appropriations from 2014 to 2018 (including administrative expenses for the management of the Agreement).
