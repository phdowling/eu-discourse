2014/0272(COD) - 24/09/2014 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to codify Council Regulation (EC) No 779/98 on the import into the Community of agricultural products originating in Turkey.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the Council and the European Parliament.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 779/98 has been substantially amended. It is recalled that on 1 April 1987, the Commission
decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement.
The Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this, stressing the importance of codification.
The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an
accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments.
CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and rationality, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No
779/98 of 7 April 1998 on the import into the Community of agricultural products originating in Turkey, repealing Regulation (EEC) No 4115/86
and amending Regulation (EC) No 3010/95.
The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it; it fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does
no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself.
Main provisions codified: Decision No 1/98 of the EC-Turkey Association Council establishes the system of preferences applicable to imports
into the Union of agricultural products originating in Turkey.
The proposed Regulation sets out uniform conditions for the implementation of this system. Implementing powers are conferred on the
Commission in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the

European Parliament and of the Council (examination procedure).
In the case of products for which Union regulations require a certain import price to be observed, the application of the preferential tariff system
shall be subject to the observance of that price. The same goes for certain fishery products.
It should be noted that the future Regulation shall repeal Regulation (EC) No 779/98.

2014/0272(COD) - 04/12/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Legal Affairs adopted the report by Andrzej DUDA (ECR, PL) on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament
and of the Council on the import into the Union of agricultural products originating in Turkey (codified text).
The committee recommended the European Parliament to adopt the Commission proposal as adapted to the recommendations of the
Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
According to the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, the proposal
in question contains a straightforward codification of the existing texts without any change in their substance.

2014/0272(COD) - 11/03/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 538 votes to 112, with 8 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council on the import into the Union of agricultural products originating in Turkey (codified text)
Parliament adopted its position at first reading in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure taking over the Commission proposal, as
adapted to the recommendations of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the
Commission.
The Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, stated that the proposal in
question contains a straightforward codification of the existing texts without any change in their substance.
The proposal seeks to empower the Commission, by means of implementing acts, to adopt rules necessary for the application of the import
regime for the products listed in Annex I to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union which originate in Turkey and which are
imported into the Union under the conditions laid down in Decision No 1/98 of the EC-Turkey Association Council.
Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure.

2014/0272(COD) - 29/04/2015 Final act
