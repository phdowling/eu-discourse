Summary

2014/2165(REG) - 28/01/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Legal Affairs adopted the report by Pavel SVOBODA (EPP, CZ) on the verification of credentials.
The committee proposed that the Parliament declare valid, subject to any decisions by the competent authorities of Member States in which
the election results have been disputed, the mandate of the Members of the European Parliament listed in the annex to this decision whose
election has been notified by the competent national authorities and who have made the written declarations as regards their professional
activities and any other remunerated functions or activities.
The list of Members of the European Parliament whose mandate is declared valid is annexed to the draft decision of the European Parliament.
The authorities of the Member States are called upon to:
notify the Parliament of all the names of the elected candidates and also to forward the names of any substitutes, together with their
ranking in accordance with the results of the vote;
complete without delay the examination of the disputes referred to them and to notify Parliament of the results.
Members noted that the nationals of certain Member States who have been living in another country for a given period of time can be deprived
of the right to vote in their home Member State (disenfranchisement). They stated that under no circumstances may disenfranchisement apply
to European elections and called on the Commission to ensure that none of the Member States provides for that possibility.
Member States are called upon to ensure that the registration formalities relating to the participation of nationals of other Member States in the
European elections are simplified.

2014/2165(REG) - 11/02/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament by 657 votes to 27, with 24 abstentions declared valid, subject to any decisions by the competent authorities of
Member States in which the election results have been disputed, the mandate of the Members of the European Parliament listed in the annex
to this decision whose election has been notified by the competent national authorities and who have made the written declarations as regards
the offices that are incompatible with the office of Member of the European Parliament, their professional activities and any other remunerated
functions or activities.
The list of Members of the European Parliament whose mandate is declared valid is annexed to the draft decision of the European Parliament.
The authorities of the Member States are called upon to:
notify the Parliament of all the names of the elected candidates and also to forward the names of any substitutes, together with their
ranking in accordance with the results of the vote;
complete without delay the examination of the disputes referred to them and to notify Parliament of the results.
Members noted that the nationals of certain Member States who have been living in another country for a given period of time can be deprived
of the right to vote in their home Member State (disenfranchisement). They considered that disenfranchisement is tantamount to punishing
nationals who have exercised the right of free movement within the EU, to denying them their right to vote and to stand as candidates in
elections to the European Parliament in their Member State of residence and to violating the principle of direct universal suffrage.
They stated that under no circumstances may disenfranchisement apply to European elections and called on the Commission to ensure that
none of the Member States provides for that possibility.
Parliament called on the Member States to ensure that the registration formalities relating to the participation of nationals of other Member
States in the European elections, whether as voters or as candidates, are simplified.
