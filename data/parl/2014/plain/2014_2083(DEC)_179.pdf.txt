OJ L 255 30.09.2015, p. 0131 Summary

2014/2083(DEC) - 30/07/2014 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: presentation by the Commission of the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2013, as part of
the 2013 discharge procedure.
Analysis of the accounts of the EU Institutions: Committee of the Regions.
Legal reminder: the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the year 2013 have been prepared on the basis of the
information presented by the institutions and bodies under Article 148(2) of the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the
European Union. They were prepared in accordance with Title IX of this Financial Regulation.
(1) Purpose: the document helps to bring insight into the EU budget mechanism and the way in which the budget has been managed and
spent in 2013, including the different expenses of the European institutions. It should be recalled that only the Commission budget contains
administrative appropriations and operating appropriations. The other Institutions have only administrative appropriations.
The document also presents the different financial actors involved in the budget process (accounting officers, internal officers and authorising
officers) and recalls their respective roles in the context of the tasks of sound financial management.
Amongst the other legal elements relating to the implementation of the EU budget presented in this document, the paper focuses on the
following issues:
accounting principles applicable to the management of EU spending (business continuity, consistency of accounting methods,
comparability of information ...);
consolidation methods of figures for all major controlled entities (the consolidated financial statements of the EU comprise all
significant controlled entities institutions, organisations and agencies);
the recognition of financial assets in the EU (tangible and intangible assets, financial assets and other miscellaneous investments);
the way in which EU public expenditure is committed and spent, including pre-financing (cash advances intended for the benefit of an
EU organ);
the means of recovery following irregularities detected;
the modus operandi of the accounting system;
the audit process followed by the European Parliament's granting of the discharge.
Discharge procedure: the final control is the discharge of the budget for a given financial year. The discharge represents the political aspect of
the external control of budget implementation and is the decision by which the European Parliament, acting on a Council recommendation,
"releases" the Commission from its responsibility for management of a given budget by marking the end of that budget's existence. When
granting discharge, Parliament may make observations which it considers important and often recommends the Commission and the other
institutions to take actions concerning these matters.
The document also details specific expenditure of the institutions, in particular: (i) pensions of former Members and officials of institutions; (ii)
joint sickness insurance scheme and (iii) buildings.
The document also presents a series of tables and detailed technical indicators on (i) the balance sheet; (ii) the economic outturn account; (iii)
cashflow tables; (iv) technical annexes concerning the financial statements.
(2) Implementation of the Committee of the Regions appropriations for the financial year 2013: the document comprises a series of detailed
annexes, the most important concerning the implementation of the budget. The appropriations available for 2013 amounted to EUR 87 million
with 97% committed.
Additional information on the management of resources of the Committee can be found in the 2013 Report on the budgetary and financial
management of the Committee of the Regions.
(3) Budgetary implementation - conclusions: in more general and political terms, the implementation of the Committees budget in 2013 was
marked by the following:
the continuation of legislative monitoring with the adoption of opinions by the Committee of Regions (73 opinions in 2013 + 7
resolutions);
the continuation of cooperation with other EU institutions and regional and local authorities.
In 2013, the Committee met 6 times in plenary and organised 2 extraordinary sessions including one in Dublin and one in Vilnius under the
rotating Presidency of the EU.
Furthermore, the report also noted the following:
monitoring of specific platforms and networks established by the Committee, such as Europe 2020 Monitoring or Subsidiarity
Monitoring;
organising an interinstitutional dialogue on the Europe 2020 sustainable growth strategy with the presence Mr Van Rompuy (22 March

2013) and an Open Days, specifically dedicated to this issue;
monitoring of the 2014-2020 financial framework negotiations within the budgets for local investment;
organising debates with EU citizens in the framework of the European Year of Citizens 2013, devoted in particular to the European
elections in 2014;
strengthening the external dimension of the Committee's activities as regards foreign policy, the EU neighbourhood policy and
cooperation, with a focus on Mediterranean countries;
negotiation of a new administrative cooperation framework with the European Parliament and renewed framework for the
management of multilingualism within the institution.

2014/2083(DEC) - 31/03/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Ryszard CZARNECKI (ECR, PL) and called on the European Parliament to give
discharge to the Secretary General of the Committee of the Regions in respect of the implementation of the budget of the Court for the
financial year 2013.
It welcomed the fact that the Court of Auditors observed that no significant weaknesses had been identified in respect of the audited topics
relating to human resources and procurement for the Committee. The latter concluded that the payments as a whole for the year ended on 31
December 2013 for administrative and other expenditure of the institutions and bodies were free from material error.
Budgetary and financial management: Members observed that in 2013, the Committee had an approved budget of EUR 87 373 000, of which
EUR 84 800 000 were commitment appropriations with an utilisation rate of 97 %. They regretted the decrease of the utilisation rate in 2013
when compared to that of 98.2 % in 2012.
Actions of the Committee of the Regions: the report noted with satisfaction that the recommendations and requirements made by Parliaments
Committee on Budgetary Control were recorded by the budget service of the Committee in a central database and that the progress of
implementation was regularly monitored. It welcomed the fact that a committee, consisting of five members and an external expert, had been
set up for internal audit purposes and that the Court of Auditors' and Parliament's recommendations were so far being taken into account.
Members made a series of observations on the daily management of the Committee and asked for:
·

more information on the plans and budgetary consequences of measures taken regarding the Committee's political activities;

·

an assessment of the advantages that the Committee had ascertained when implementing the new budgetary system;

·

an individual assessment of the impact that the savings made from the Cooperation Agreement between the European Economic
and Social Committee (EESC), the Committee, and Parliament, which was eventually signed on 5 February 2014 and led to the
transfer of a large number of Committee staff to the new European Parliamentary Research Service (EPRS);

·

information on the Committees intention to rationalise translation requests and to standardise some types of documents;

·

more information on the common methodology agreed with other institutions to calculate and compare translation costs and other
indicators;

·

reduction in the costs of staff away days;

·

improvement in the rate of unused interpretation services and better planning meetings;

·

improvement in raising the Committees profile by stepping up the necessary information and communication policy;

·

establishment of an equality plan, particularly with regard to management posts;

·

clarifications on buildings policy ;

·

inclusion in its annual activity reports, in compliance with the existing rules on confidentiality and data protection, the results and
consequences of closed OLAF cases, where the institution or any of the individuals working for it were the subject of the
investigation.

Committee of the Regions in respect of the implementation of the budget of the Committee of the Regions for the financial year 2013.
In its resolution accompanying the discharge decision, adopted by 579 votes to 109, with 4 abstentions, Parliament welcomed the fact that the

an assessment of the advantages of the new budgetary system implemented by the Committee;
the establishment of a regular review of the savings made from the new Cooperation Agreement between the European Economic
and Social Committee (EESC), the Committee, and Parliament, which was eventually signed on 5 February 2014 and led to the

Parliament recalled that the Committee was enmeshed, from 2013, in the same case related to a whistleblowing. It stressed the considerable
cost to the taxpayers of the Union as well as the harm suffered by the informant. It demanded that the Committee of the Regions complies
within the shortest deadlines to the conclusions contained in the judgment of the European Union Civil Service Tribunal dated 7 May 2013, to
recognize the action of the applicant as being legitimate and finally closing the case.
Lastly, it stressed that the Parliament will not tolerate any unfavourable treatment against whistleblowers in its own ranks and in any other
institution of the Union.
