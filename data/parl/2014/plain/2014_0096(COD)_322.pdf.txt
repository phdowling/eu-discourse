Directive 2015/2203
OJ L 314 01.12.2015, p. 0001 Summary
Final legislative act with provisions for delegated acts

2014/0096(COD) - 20/03/2014 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to replace Directive 83/417/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to certain lactoproteins (caseins
and caseinates) intended for human consumption, in the new legal context created by the Lisbon Treaty.
PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: Council Directive 83/417/EEC provides for the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to certain
lactoproteins (caseins and caseinates) intended for human consumption.
Since the entry into force of that Directive several changes have taken place, notably the development of a comprehensive legal framework in
the area of food law and the adoption of an international standard by the Codex Alimentarius for edible casein products, which need to be
taken into account.
Directive 83/417/EEC confers powers on the Commission in order to implement some of its provisions. As a consequence of the entry into
force of the Lisbon Treaty, those powers need to be aligned to Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (the Treaty)
which allows the legislator to delegate to the Commission the power to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or
amend certain non-essential elements of a legislative act.
For the sake of clarity, Directive 83/417/EEC should therefore be repealed and replaced with a new Directive
CONTENT: the proposal is aimed at designing the Commission's empowerment in the new legal context created by the Lisbon Treaty. It also
takes account of the further development of legislation in the past years and of existing, updated international standards.
The proposal:
identifies the need for delegated power to be conferred on the Commission for the purpose of adopting amendments to Annexes I and
II and establishes the corresponding procedure for adoption of these acts in the new legal context determined by the entry into force of
Articles 290 and 291 of the TFEU;
adapts existing provisions to the further development of legislation notably in the field of food law;
adjust, where appropriate, the composition requirements of edible caseins to the corresponding Codex standard. This adjustment
results in two changes: the maximum moisture content of edible casein is increased from 10 to 12% and the maximum milk fat content
of edible acid casein is decreased from 2.25 to 2%. With this change, the compositional requirements laid down in the proposal are
fully in line with the international standard so as to avoid trade distortions.
Moreover the proposal takes into consideration the need for the Member States to have some margin to adapt the implementation to the
national legal and administrative environment, in particular with reference to the possible adoption of national measures in matters not
specifically harmonised by the proposal.

2014/0096(COD) - 05/03/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety adopted the report by Giovanni LA VIA (EPP, IT) on the proposal for a
directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to caseins and
caseinates intended for human consumption and repealing Council Directive 83/417/EEC.
The committee recommended that the European Parliaments position adopted at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure
should amend the Commission proposal. The amendments seek in particular to:
recall that under Regulation No 1169/20116 of the European Parliament and of the Council, sufficient information is to be provided in

business to business relations in order to ensure the presence and accuracy of food information for the final consumer;
update the definition of caseine, a technical update that will bring the legislation in line with Codex Standard N290 for edible casein by
using the same definitions (International food standards as defined by the FAO and WHO);
propose that the power to adopt delegated acts in order to adapt the Annexes to international standards and technical progress should
not be conferred on the Commission for an unlimited period of time, but rather for 5 years. In order for the co-legislators to decide
whether to extend the delegation of powers, the Commission shall draw up a report in this regard at the latest 9 months before the end
of the 5-year period;
propose to set an ambitious yet realistic date for the implementation of this Directive in the Member States (six months after the entry
into force of this Directive instead of 31 March).
To conclude, Members suggested a technical amendment in order to ensure that the Directive is perfectly aligned to the Codex Alimentarius
as well as an amendment aiming to calculate the milk protein content on the basis of the absolute weight of the product (instead of on the
basis of the dried extract).

2014/0096(COD) - 07/10/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 642 votes to 54, with 9 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a directive of the
European Parliament and of the Council on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to caseins and caseinates intended
for human consumption and repealing Council Directive 83/417/EEC.
The European Parliaments position adopted at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure amended the Commission proposal as
follows:
Objectives of the Directive: the Directive seeks to facilitate, through approximation of the laws of the Member States, the free movement of
caseins and caseinates intended for human consumption while providing a high level of protection of health, and to bring existing provisions
into line with general Union legislation on food and with international standards.
Updated definitions: for the purposes of this Directive, the following definitions apply:
edible acid casein means a milk product obtained by separating, washing and drying the acid-precipitated coagulum of skimmed milk
and/or of other products obtained from milk;
edible rennet casein means a milk product obtained by separating, washing and drying the coagulum of skimmed milk and/or of other
products obtained from milk; the coagulum is obtained through the reaction of rennet or other coagulating enzymes;
edible caseinate means a milk product obtained by action of edible casein or edible casein curd coagulum with neutralizing agents,
followed by drying.
This Directive should use the terms 'food additives' and 'processing aids' in respect of the standards applicable to edible caseins and edible
caseinates. Such use of terminology would also be in line with the Codex standard for edible casein products.
Under Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council, sufficient information is to be provided in business to
business relations in order to ensure the presence and accuracy of food information for the final consumer. It is stipulated that particulars shall
be marked on the packages, containers or labels of the milk products in easily visible, clearly legible and indelible characters.
Where the minimum milk protein content set out in Annexes I and II is exceeded in the milk products, this fact may, without prejudice to other
provisions of Union law, be adequately marked on the packages, containers or labels of the product.
Delegated acts: the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts to amend the standards set out in the Annexes. The power to
adopt delegated shall be conferred on the Commission for a period of five years which may be tacitly extended for periods of an identical
duration.
Transposition: the Directive shall be transposed at the latest 12 months after the entry into force of this Directive.

2014/0096(COD) - 25/11/2015 Final act
PURPOSE: to facilitate the free movement of caseins and caseinates intended for human consumption while providing a high level of
protection of health, and to bring existing provisions into line with general Union legislation on food and with international standards.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Directive (EU) 2015/2203 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the approximation of the laws of the Member
States relating to caseins and caseinates intended for human consumption and repealing Council Directive 83/417/EEC.
CONTENT: this Directive applies to caseins and caseinates which are intended for human consumption and mixtures thereof.
It repeals Council Directive 83/417/EEC which provides for the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to certain lactoproteins
(caseins and caseinates) intended for human consumption.
Since the entry into force of that Directive, several changes have taken place, in particular the development of a comprehensive legal
framework in the area of food law and the adoption of an international standard for edible casein products by the Codex Alimentarius
Commission which need to be taken into account.
In addition, Directive 83/417/EEC confers powers on the Commission in order to implement some of its provisions. As a consequence of the
entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, those powers need to be aligned to Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.
The new Directive:
updates definitions such as: edible acid casein; edible rennet casein; edible caseinate. This Directive should use the terms 'food
additives' and 'processing aids' in respect of the standards applicable to edible caseins and edible caseinates. Such use of
terminology would also be in line with the Codex standard for edible casein products;

adjust, where appropriate, the composition requirements of edible caseins to the corresponding Codex standard. This adjustment
results in two changes: the maximum moisture content of edible casein is increased from 10 to 12% and the maximum milk fat content
of edible acid casein is decreased from 2.25 to 2%;
lays down the obligations of Member States: the aim is to ensure that: (i) the milk products are marketed, under the names specified
therein, only if they comply with the rules laid down in this Directive; (ii) caseins and caseinates which do not comply with the
standards set out in the Directive are not used for the preparation of food, and, where lawfully marketed for other purposes, are named
and labelled in such a way that the purchaser is not misled as to their nature, quality or intended use;
provides labelling measures: under Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council, sufficient
information is to be provided in business to business relations in order to ensure the presence and accuracy of food information for the
final consumer. The Directive stipulated that particulars shall be marked on the packages, containers or labels of the milk products in
easily visible, clearly legible and indelible characters.
Lastly, the Directive seeks to align the provisions conferring implementing powers on the Commission with the rules introduced by the Lisbon
Treaty.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 21.12.2015.
TRANSPOSITION: 22.12.2016.
DELEGATED ACTS: the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the
standards applicable to edible caseins and edible caseinates laid down in Annexes I and II. The power to adopt delegated acts shall be
conferred on the Commission for a period of five years (renewable) from 21 December 2015. The European Parliament or the Council may
object to a delegated act within a period of two months from the date of notification (this period may be extended by two months). If the
European Parliament or the Council objects, the delegated act shall not enter into force.
