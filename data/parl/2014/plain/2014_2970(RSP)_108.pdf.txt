Summary

The European Parliament adopted a resolution on Serbia: the case of accused war criminal eelj.
The resolution adopted in plenary was tabled on behalf of the EPP, S&D, ECR, ALDE, Greens/EFA and EFDD groups.
Members recalled that Vojislav eelj, the president of the Serbian Radical Party, is indicted before the ICTY for persecutions on political, racial
or religious grounds, deportation, inhumane acts (forcible transfer) (crimes against humanity), and for murder, torture, cruel treatment, wanton
destruction of villages, etc. in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and parts of Vojvodina (Serbia), committed between 1991 and 1993.
Today, after more than eleven years of detention, eelj is on provisional release on the grounds of the deterioration of his health, subject to the
conditions that he: (i) does not influence witnesses and victims; and (ii) appears before the Chamber as soon as it so orders. However, eelj
has emphasised that he will not voluntarily return to the Tribunal when requested to do so. In his public statements, he repeatedly called for
the creation of Greater Serbia, publicly stating claims on neighbouring countries, including EU Member State Croatia, and inciting hatred
against non-Serb people.
Against this background, the European Parliament strongly condemned eeljs warmongering, incitement to hatred and encouragement of
territorial claims and his attempts to derail Serbia from its European path. It stressed that eeljs recent statements could have the effect of
undermining the progress made in regional cooperation and reconciliation and subverting the efforts of recent years.
Members reminded the Serbian authorities of their obligations under the framework for cooperation with the ICTY and of Serbias obligations as
an EU candidate country. In general, it noted with concern that the absence of an adequate political reaction and legal response by the
Serbian authorities regarding eeljs behaviour undermines the trust of the victims in the judicial process. It encouraged the Serbian authorities
to investigate whether eelj has violated Serbian law and to strengthen and fully apply the legislation outlawing hate speech, discrimination and
incitement to violence.
Lastly, Parliament encouraged the ICTY to take determined action and to take all necessary measures to bring perpetrators of war crimes to
justice which is an indispensable condition for a genuine and lasting reconciliation process.
