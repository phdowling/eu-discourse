Summary

2014/2630(RSP) - 13/03/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 52 votes to 0 with 1 abstention a resolution on security and human trafficking in Sinai. The resolution

was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ALDE, Greens/EFA, and ECR groups.
Parliament condemned the recent terrorist attacks against security forces and civilians in Sinai, and expressed its deep concern regarding the
reported cases of human trafficking there, noting that thousands of people had been kidnapped in eastern Sudan, taken to Egypt and tortured
in Sinai, more than 4 000 of whom have died since the beginning of 2008. It was believed that around 1 000 African refugees are currently
being held in captivity.
Members stressed the responsibility of the Egyptian and Israeli governments to combat human trafficking in this area. Noting that the Egyptian
interim Government seemed unable to bring the security crisis in Sinai under control, Parliament called for intensified efforts. It also underlined
the importance of coordinated regional action in restoring security and combating human trafficking in Sinai, and called for increased
international support and more cooperation in this field among the governments of Egypt, Israel, Libya, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Sudan, as well as
with relevant organisations, including the UN Multinational Force and Observers. Members called on the VP/HR and the Commission to:
·

make this a high-priority topic on the agenda of political dialogue with Egypt, Israel and Sudan;

·

actively work with the UNHCR to set up an action group with states involved in the various stages of the trafficking chain, including
sources, transit, and destination;

·

emphasise respect for human rights in its relations with the Eritrean Government, noting that up to 3 000 people flee from there every
month, according to the UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Eritrea.

Parliament emphasised once again the EUs offer to assist the authorities in improving the quality of the assistance and protection offered to
asylum seekers and refugees residing on, or transiting through, their territory. In this respect it welcomed the Sudanese Governments recent
call for EU support.
The resolution also stressed the importance of assistance to Sinai survivors, and called for full access of UN agencies and human rights
organisations to the areas affected. It noted, in this connection, that the Egyptian authorities did not allow the UNHCR access to asylum
seekers and migrants arrested in Sinai and did not attempt to identify potential trafficking victims among them. Members recalled also Israeli
law of 10 December 2013, which allowed for indefinite detention of asylum seekers . Destination countries authorities were asked to treat
asylum-seekers in line with international refugee and human rights law.
Parliament was also very concerned about reports from Europol that several EU Member States have had reports of blackmailing within the
EU on behalf of Bedouin organised criminal groups in Sinai, noting that many of the families of the victims live in Member States. It called on
EU Foreign Ministers and Ministers of Justice to take appropriate measures, and also on the EU institution to put pressure on Israel and Egypt
to take steps to tackle trafficking in Sinai and to drive forward the implementation of Europols forthcoming recommendations.
Lastly, Members recalled that one of the root causes of the crises was the marginalisation of the Bedouins in Sinai, and considered that any
possible solution to the crisis should include a comprehensive development programme aimed at improving the socioeconomic status and
conditions of the local Bedouin population, urging the EU to continue funding NGO-led projects in the region.
