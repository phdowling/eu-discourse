2014/2170(BUD) - 28/10/2014 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: to mobilise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) to assist Italy following redundancies in its manufacture of
electrical equipment sector.
PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
CONTENT: Article 12 of Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 laying down the multiannual financial framework for the years
2014-2020 provides that the EGF shall not exceed a maximum annual amount of EUR 150 million (2011 prices).
The rules applicable to financial contributions from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) are laid down in Regulation (EU) No
1309/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (2014-2020) and repealing
Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 (the 'EGF Regulation').
The Commission examined the application for mobilisation of the EGF to assist Italy and concluded the following:
Italy:application EGF/2014/010 IT/Whirlpool: the Italian authorities submitted application EGF/2014/010 IT/Whirlpool for a financial contribution
from the EGF, following redundancies in Whirlpool Europe S.r.l. and five suppliers and downstream producers in Italy. The authorities
submitted the application within the 12 week delay as set out in the EGF Regulation, which expires on 5 November 2014.
In order to establish the link between the redundancies and the global financial and economic crisis, Italy argues that in 2009, as a
consequence of the global financial and economic crisis, there was a significant downturn in the economy at EU-28 level, as well as in the
Italian economy. The Italian GDP growth rate was positive in 2010 (1.7%) and 2011 (0.4%) and negative since then (-2.4% in 2012 and -1.9%
in 2013).
This situation of recession has had a profound effect on the consumption choices of Italian households which had reconsidered their buying
decisions, in particular those related to buying durable goods. Domestic appliances belong to this group of goods.

According to data referred to by the Italian authorities, all five largest domestic appliance manufacturers in Italy (Electrolux, Indesit, Whirlpool
Europe, Franke and Antonio Merloni), have suffered a sharp decline in production over the period 2008-2012 due to the economic and
financial crisis.
The Commission states that to date, the manufacture of electrical equipment sector has been the subject of three EGF applications, all of them
based on the global financial and economic crisis. The arguments presented in previous EGF applications related to this sector remain valid.
Background to the French application: the Italian authorities submitted the application under the intervention criterion of Article 4(1)(a) of the
EGF Regulation, which requires at least 500 workers being made redundant or self-employed persons' activity ceasing, over a reference
period of four months in an enterprise in a Member State, including workers made redundant in its suppliers and downstream producers.
The Italian authorities voluntarily shortened the reference period of four months provided for in Regulation (EU) No 1309/2013. The reference
period is from 10 December 2013 to 31 March 2014.
The application relates to 608 workers made redundant in Whirlpool Europe S.r.l. and five providers and downstream producers. The primary
enterprise operated in the economic sector classified under NACE Rev. 2 division 27 ('Manufacture of electrical equipment'). The
redundancies made by the enterprises concerned are located in the NUTS level 2 region of Provincia Autonoma di Trento (ITH2).
Following its assessment of this application, the Commission has concluded, in accordance with all applicable provisions of the EGF
Regulation, that the conditions for awarding a financial contribution from the EGF are met.
In view of the Italian request, it is proposed to mobilise the EGF for the amount of EUR 1 890 000 to make a contribution to the package of
personalised services.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: having examined the application in respect of the conditions set out in Article 13(1) of the EGF Regulation, and
having taken into account the number of targeted beneficiaries, the proposed actions and the estimated costs, the Commission proposes to
mobilise the EGF for the amount of EUR 1 890 000, representing 60 % of the total costs of the proposed actions, in order to provide a financial
contribution for the application.
The proposed decision to mobilise the EGF will be taken jointly by the European Parliament and the Council, as laid down in point 13 of the
Interinstitutional Agreement of 2 December 2013 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline,
on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management.
At the same time as it presents this proposal for a decision to mobilise the EGF, the Commission will present to the European Parliament and
to the Council a proposal for a transfer to the relevant budgetary line for the requested amount.
When the Commission adopts this proposal for a decision to mobilise the EGF, it will also adopt a decision on a financial contribution, by
means of an implementing act, which will enter into force on the date at which the European Parliament and the Council adopt the proposed
decision to mobilise the EGF.

2014/2170(BUD) - 11/12/2014 Budgetary report tabled for plenary, 1st reading
The Committee on Budgets adopted the report by Daniele Viotti (S&D, IT on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the
Council on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, to the amount of EUR 1 890 000 in commitment and payment
appropriations in order to assist Italy following redundancies in the electrical equipment sector. Members recalled that the Union set up
legislative and budgetary instruments to provide additional support to workers who are suffering from the consequences of major structural
changes in world trade patterns and to assist their reintegration into the labour market.
Italys application: the Italian authorities submitted application EGF/2014/010 IT/Whirlpool on 18 June 2014 following the dismissal of 608
workers in Whirlpool Europe S.r.l., an enterprise which operated in the economic sector classified under NACE Rev. 2 division 27
('Manufacture of electrical equipment'), and five providers and downstream producers. Members noted that the Italian authorities submitted the
application under the intervention criterion of Article 4(1)(a) of the EGF Regulation, which requires at least 500 workers being made redundant
or self-employed persons' activity ceasing, over a reference period of four months in an enterprise in a Member State, including workers made
redundant or self-employed persons' activity ceasing in its suppliers and downstream producers. Therefore, Italy is entitled to a financial
contribution under the EGF Regulation.
Members welcomed the fact that, in order to provide workers with speedy assistance, the Italian authorities decided to initiate the
implementation of the personalised services to the affected workers on 4 February 2014, ahead of the final decision on granting the EGF
support for the proposed coordinated package and even of the application for a financial contribution from the EGF.
Nature of the redundancies: Members highlighted that due to the financial and economic crisis resulting in significant decline of household
consumption, the Italian market for big household appliances has dropped from EUR 3 174 billion in 2010 to EUR 2 649 billion in 2013, this
representing a decline by 16.5%. They noted that these redundancies will further aggravate the unemployment situation in the province of
Trento, where the unemployment rate has doubled since the beginning of the crisis, raising from 2.9% in 2007 to 6.1% in 2013.
A coordinated package of personalised services: Members noted that the personalised services which are to be provided consist of:
information sessions, intake and registration, counselling and guidance, skills assessment, general training and re-training, vocational training,
coaching, accompaniment after reintegration into work and accompaniment towards entrepreneurship. These services also include job-search
allowance as well as participation allowance.
Members noted that 16.78% of the targeted beneficiaries are non-EU citizens. They considered that certain elements of the coaching activity
could be particularly useful to help these beneficiaries to re-integrate into the labour market.
New EGF: Members welcomed the adoption of the EGF Regulation which reflects the agreement reached between the Parliament and the
Council to reintroduce the crisis mobilisation criterion, to increase Union financial contribution to 60% of the total estimated cost of proposed
measures, to increase efficiency for the treatment of EGF applications in the Commission and by the Parliament and the Council by shortening
time for assessment and approval, to widen eligible actions and beneficiaries by introducing self-employed persons and young people and to
finance incentives for setting up own businesses.

106 workers made redundant in five suppliers and downstream producers are also included in the number of eligible beneficiaries, which
amounts to 608 persons in total, all of them being counted as targeted beneficiaries of the EGF measures.

2014/2170(BUD) - 17/12/2014 Final act
PURPOSE: to mobilise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) to assist Italy following redundancies in its manufacture of
electrical equipment sector.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision (EU) 2015/42 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the mobilisation of the European
Globalisation Adjustment Fund, in accordance with point 13 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 2 December 2013 between the European
Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline, on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial
management (application EGF/2014/010 IT/Whirlpool, from Italy).
CONTENT: with this Decision, the European Parliament and the Council have decided to mobilise the sum of EUR 1 890 000 in commitment
and payment appropriations from European Globalisation Adjustment Fund within the framework of the general budget of the European Union
for the financial year 2014.
This amount shall assist Italy following redundancies in Whirlpool Europe S.r.l. and five suppliers and downstream producers.
Given that this application complies with the requirements for determining the financial contributions as laid down in Regulation (EU) No
1309/2013 (EGF Regulation 2014-2020), the European Parliament and Council have decided to grant the abovementioned amount.
To recall, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund was established to provide support for workers made redundant and self-employed
persons whose activity has ceased as a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation, as a result of a
continuation of the global financial and economic crisis addressed in Regulation (EC) No 546/2009 of the European Parliament and of the
Council, or as a result of a new global financial and economic crisis and to assist them with their reintegration into the labour market.
Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 laying down the multiannual financial framework for the years 2014-2020 provides that the EGF shall
not exceed a maximum annual amount of EUR 150 million.
