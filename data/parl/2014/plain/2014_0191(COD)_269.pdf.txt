2014/0191(COD) - 25/06/2014 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to codify Council Regulation (EC) No 1616/2006 on certain procedures for applying the Stabilisation and Association Agreement
between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Albania, of the other part, and for applying the Interim
Agreement between the European Community and Albania.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and rationality, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No
1616/2006 of 23 October 2006 on certain procedures for applying the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European
Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Albania, of the other part, and for applying the Interim Agreement between the
European Community and Albania.
Council Regulation (EC) No 1616/2006 has been substantially amended. It is recalled that on 1 April 1987 the Commission decided to instruct
its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement.
The Conclusions of the Presidency of the December 1992 Edinburgh European Council confirmed this, stressing the importance of
codification.
The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an
accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments.
The new proposed Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it; this proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being
codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise
itself.

2014/0191(COD) - 10/03/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Legal Affairs adopted the report of Andrzej DUDA (ECR, PL) on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament
and of the Council on certain procedures for applying the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and
their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Albania, of the other part (codified text).
The parliamentary committee recommended that the European Parliament adopts its position at first reading, taking over the Commission
proposal as adapted to the recommendations of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council
and the Commission.
The Consultative Working Party concluded that the proposal is a straightforward codification of existing texts, without any change in their
substance.

2014/0191(COD) - 29/04/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 622 votes to 52, with 19 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council on certain procedures for applying the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the
European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Albania, of the other part (codified text).
Parliament adopted its position at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure taking over the Commission proposal.
The Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission concluded that the
proposal in question contains a straightforward codification of the existing texts without any change in their substance.
Council Regulation (EC) No 1616/2006 lays down the procedures for applying certain provisions of the Stabilisation and Association
Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Albania, of the other part (SAA)
which was signed in Luxembourg on 12 June 2006 and entered into force on 1 April 2009.
The proposal seeks to:
lay down provisions regulating the management of tariff quotas for fishery products originating in Albania which may be imported into
the Union;
provide that the trade defence measures should be adopted in accordance with the general provisions laid down in Regulation (EU)
2015/478 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Regulation (EU) 2015/479 of the European Parliament and of the Council,
Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 or, as the case may be, Council Regulation (EC) No 597/2009;
state that where a Member State provides information to the Commission on a possible fraud or failure to provide administrative
cooperation, the relevant Union legislation shall apply;
provide that the for the purposes of implementing the relevant provisions of this Regulation, the Commission should be assisted by the
Customs Code Committee;
stipulates that the implementation of the bilateral safeguard clauses of the SAA requires uniform conditions for the adoption of
safeguard and other measures should be adopted in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and
of the Council (comitology);
enable the Commission to adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases relating to exceptional and
critical circumstances, imperative grounds of urgency so require.

Republic of Albania, of the other part (codified text).
CONTENT: Council Regulation (EC) No 1616/2006 has been substantially amended several times. Consequently, in the interests of clarity
and rationality, it was decided to codify the Regulation.
The codified Regulation lays down the procedures for applying the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European
Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Albania, of the other part, and for applying the Interim Agreement between the
European Community and Albania which was signed in Luxembourg on 12 June 2006 and entered into force 1 April 2009.
The Regulation specifically seeks to:
lay down the rules governing fishery products originating in Albania may be imported into the Union at a reduced customs duty, within
the limits of tariff quotas;
require that any trade defence measures should be adopted in accordance with the general provisions of Regulation (EU) 2015/478 of
the European Parliament and of the Council, Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 or, as the case may be, Council Regulation (EC)
No 597/2009;
indicate the relevant legislation to apply where a Member State provides information to the Commission on a possible fraud or failure
to provide administrative cooperation;
provide that the Commission should be assisted by the Customs Code Committee;
stipulate that any safeguard measures should be adopted in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European

Parliament and the Council;
enable the Commission to adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases relating to exceptional and
critical circumstances arising, imperative grounds of urgency so require.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 15.7.2015. Regulation (EC) No 1616/2006 is repealed.
