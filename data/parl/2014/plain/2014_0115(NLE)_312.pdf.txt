PURPOSE: the conclusion of the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for in the Fisheries
Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent.
BACKGROUND: on the basis of a mandate given by the Council, the Commission negotiated the renewal of the Protocol to the Fisheries
Partnership Agreement between the Union and São Tomé and Príncipe.
At the end of the negotiations a new draft protocol was initialled by the negotiators on 19 December 2013.
LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) and the seventh
subparagraph of Article 218(7) thereof.
CONTENT: under this proposal, the Council is called upon to approve on behalf of the European Union the Protocol to the Fisheries
Partnership Agreement with the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe.
Objectives: the main purpose of the Protocol to the Agreement is to grant fishing opportunities to European Union vessels in São Toméan
waters, in compliance with the best scientific opinions available and the recommendations of the International Commission for the
Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), within the limits of the available surplus. The Commission based itself in part on the results of an
ex-post evaluation of the previous Protocol carried out by external experts.
The aim is also to strengthen cooperation between the European Union and the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe with a view to
establishing a sustainable fisheries policy and sound exploitation of fisheries resources in the São Toméan fishing zone, in the interests of both
parties.
Financial contribution: the overall financial contribution under the Protocol is EUR 2 805 000 over 4 years It comprises:
an annual amount for access to the EEZ of São Tomé and Príncipe of EUR 385 000 for the first three years and EUR 350 000 for the
fourth year, equivalent to a reference tonnage of 7 000 tonnes per year, and
a specific amount of EUR 325 000 per year for four years to support the implementation of the sectoral fisheries policy of São Tomé
and Príncipe (small-scale fishing and the monitoring, control and combating of illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing).
If the overall annual quantity of catches by European Union vessels in São Toméan waters exceeds the annual reference tonnage, the total
amount of the annual financial contribution shall be increased by EUR 55 for the first three years and EUR 50 for the fourth year for each
additional tonne caught.
However, the total annual amount paid by the European Union shall not be more than twice the amount indicated in the protocol. Where the
quantities caught by European Union vessels exceed quantities corresponding to twice the total annual amount, the amount due for the
quantity exceeding that limit shall be paid the following year.
Fishing opportunities: the protocol provides for fishing opportunities in the following categories:
28 tuna seiners
6 surface longliners for fishing highly-migratory species listed in Annex 1 to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea
(1982) to be caught, with the exception of species protected or prohibited by ICCAT.
New fishing possibilities: as regards the operation of fisheries not covered by this Protocol, the authorities of São Tomé and Príncipe may call
on the European Union to consider the possibility of such fisheries, on the basis of the results of a scientific campaign taking account of best
scientific advice endorsed by scientific experts representing both parties. The parties shall then agree on the conditions applicable to these
new fishing opportunities, if necessary.
Duration of the agreement: the protocol will last four years from the date of its signature.
BUDGETARY IMPACT: the annual financial contribution is EUR 710 000 for the first three years and EUR 675 000 for the fourth year, based
on the reference tonnage indicated in the protocol.
