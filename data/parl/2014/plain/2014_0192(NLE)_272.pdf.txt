2014/0192(NLE) - 25/06/2014 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 994/98 of 7 May 1998 on the application of Articles 107 and 108 of the Treaty on the
Functioning of the European Union to certain categories of horizontal State aid.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to
follow its opinion.
BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 994/98 has been substantially amended. It is recalled that on 1 April 1987 the Commission
decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement.
The Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this requirement, stressing the importance of codification.
The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an
accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments.
CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and rationality, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No
994/98 on the application of Articles 107 and 108 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to certain categories of horizontal
State aid.
The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it; this proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and
hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself.
The proposal stipulates that the Commission may, by means of block exemption regulations, declare that certain categories of aid are
compatible with the internal market in accordance with Article 107 of the TFEU and are not subject to the notification requirements of Article
108 of the TFEU.
These categories include aid in favour of: (i) small and medium-sized enterprises; (ii) research, development and innovation; (iii) environmental
protection; (iv) basic broadband infrastructure; (v) employment and training; (vi) sports as well as aid that complies with the map approved by
the Commission for each Member State for the grant of regional aid.
These regulations shall specify for each category of aid:
the purpose of the aid,
the categories of beneficiaries,
thresholds limiting the exempted aid,
the conditions governing the cumulation of aid,
the conditions of monitoring.
Similarly, the Commission may decide to exempt certain aid from the notification procedure provided for in Article 108, provided that aid
granted to the same undertaking over a given period of time does not exceed a certain fixed amount ( de minimis aid).
When adopting regulations, the Commission shall impose detailed rules upon Member States to ensure transparency and monitoring of the aid

exempted from notification. Regulations shall apply for a specific period.

2014/0192(NLE) - 14/11/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Legal Affairs adopted the report by Andrzej DUDA (ECR, PL) on the proposal for a Council regulation on the application of
Articles 107 and 108 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to certain categories of horizontal state aid (codified text).
It recommended the European Parliament to approve the Commission proposal as adapted to the recommendations of the Consultative
Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
The Consultative Working Party stated that the proposal in question contains a straightforward codification of the existing texts without any
change in their substance.

2014/0192(NLE) - 29/04/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 636 votes to 52, with 11 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a Council regulation on
the application of Articles 107 and 108 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to certain categories of horizontal state aid
(codified text).
Parliament approved, without amendment, the Commission proposal as adapted to the recommendations of the Consultative Working Party of
the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
According to the Consultative Working Party, the proposal in question contains a straightforward codification of the existing texts without any
change in their substance.

2014/0192(NLE) - 13/07/2015 Final act
PURPOSE: codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 994/98 of 7 May 1998 on the application of Articles 107 and 108 of the Treaty on the
Functioning of the European Union to certain categories of horizontal State aid.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Council Regulation (EU) 2015/1588 on the application of Articles 107 and 108 of the Treaty on the Functioning of
the European Union to certain categories of horizontal State aid.
CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and rationality, this Regulation codifies Council Regulation (EC) No 994/98 on the application of Articles
107 and 108 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to certain categories of horizontal State aid. The new Regulation
supersedes the various acts incorporated in it. It fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them
together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself.
The main elements of the Regulation are as follows:
Exemptions by category: the Regulation stipulates that the Commission may, by means of block exemption regulations, declare that certain
categories of aid are compatible with the internal market in accordance with Article 107 of the TFEU and are not subject to the notification
requirements of Article 108 of the TFEU.
These categories include:
aid in favour of: (i) small and medium-sized enterprises; (ii) research, development and innovation; (iii) environmental protection; (iv)
employment and training; (v) culture and heritage conservation; (vi) making good the damage caused by natural disasters and making
good the damage caused by certain adverse weather conditions in fisheries; (vii) forestry; (viii) promotion of certain food sector
products; (ix) conservation of marine and freshwater biological resources; (x) sports; (xii) residents of remote regions, for transport,
when this aid has a social character; (xiii) basic broadband infrastructure,
as well as aid that complies with the map approved by the Commission for each Member State for the grant of regional aid.
These regulations shall specify for each category of aid:
the purpose of the aid,
the categories of beneficiaries,
thresholds limiting the exempted aid,
the conditions governing the cumulation of aid,
the conditions of monitoring.
De minimis: similarly, the Commission may decide to exempt certain aid from the notification procedure provided for in Article 108, provided
that aid granted to the same undertaking over a given period of time does not exceed a certain fixed amount ( de minimis aid).
Transparency and control: when adopting regulations, the Commission shall impose detailed rules upon Member States to ensure
transparency and monitoring of the aid exempted from notification. Regulations shall apply for a specific period.
Hearing of interested parties: where the Commission intends to adopt a regulation, it shall publish a draft thereof to enable all interested
persons and organisations to submit their comments to it within a reasonable time limit to be fixed by the Commission and which may not
under any circumstances be less than one month.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 14.10.2015.
