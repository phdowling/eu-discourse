Summary

2014/2208(INI) - 02/07/2014 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: to facilitate the transition to a circular economy guaranteeing new jobs and sustainable growth.
BACKGROUND: moving towards a more circular economy is essential to deliver the resource efficiency agenda established under the Europe
2020 Strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. Circular economy systems keep the added value in products for as long as possible
and eliminate waste. They keep resources within the economy when a product has reached the end of its life, so that they can be productively
used again and again and hence create further value.
Transition to a more circular economy requires changes throughout value chains, from product design to new business and market models,
from new ways of turning waste into a resource to new modes of consumer behaviour. This implies full systemic change, and innovation not
only in technologies, but also in organisation, society, finance methods and policies.
It is estimated that waste prevention, ecodesign, reuse and similar measures could bring net savings of 600 billion, or 8% of annual turnover,
for businesses in the EU, while reducing total annual greenhouse gas emissions by 2-4%. However, for this to happen the market barriers that
prevent these opportunities from being developed need to be overcome.
With the 2011 Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe, the Commission proposed a framework for action and underlined the need for an
integrated approach across many policy areas and levels. The main ideas of the Roadmap are now developed in the General Union
Environment Action Programme (7th EAP). The high-level European Resource Efficiency Platform, bringing together selected governments,
businesses and civil society organisations, called for action to move to a more circular economy, which relies more on reuse and high?quality
recycling and much less on primary raw materials.

CONTENT: the Communication shows how a more resource efficient use of resources can offer new perspectives on growth and employment.
The expected efficiency gains are innovative product design, more efficient and sustainable products and production processes,
future-oriented business models and technical progress which will convert waste into resources.
The Communication underlines the following points:
Supporting design and innovation for a more circular economy: the Commission demonstrates, under the EU Research and Innovation
Programme (Horizon 2020), the opportunities for moving towards a circular economy at European level with large-scale innovation projects
targeted at cooperation within and between value chains.
Unlocking investment in circular economy solutions: the Commission will examine innovative financial instruments under development, such as
the Natural Capital Financing Facility of the Commission and the European Investment Bank, as well as public private partnerships (PPP). It
will further integrate circular economy priorities into EU funding and encourage Member States to use available EU funding in programmes and
projects on the circular economy, in particular through the European Structural and Investment Funds.
Harnessing action by business and consumers and supporting SMEs: the Commission will assess the results of the Environmental Footprint
pilot phase which will run until 2016 and explain how the extent of the environmental impact can be used for product and process design and
applied to better inform consumers about sustainable environmental choices.
Defining waste targets for a move to a recycling society: in order to increase the economic, social and environmental advantages of a better
management of municipal waste, the Commission proposes the following approaches:
·

boost reuse and recycling of municipal waste to a minimum of 70% by 2030;

·

increase the recycling rate for packaging waste to 80% by 2030, with interim targets of 60% by 2020 and 70% by 2025, including
targets for specific materials;

·

ban the landfilling of recyclable plastics, metals, glass, paper and cardboard, and biodegradable waste by 2025, while Member
States should endeavour to virtually eliminate landfill by 2030;

·

further promote the development of markets for high quality secondary raw materials, including through evaluating the added value of
end-of-waste criteria for specific materials;

·

clarify the calculation method for recycled materials in order to ensure a high recycling quality level.

Setting a resource efficiency target: in the 7th EAP, Member States and the European Parliament agreed that the European Union should
establish indicators and set targets for resource efficiency, and assess whether it would be appropriate to include a lead indicator and target in
the European Semester.
The EU is already forecast to increase its resource productivity by 15% between 2014 and 2030 under a business-as-usual scenario. Policies
that encourage the transition to a more circular economy that promotes the European platform for efficient resource use could lead to doubling
this figure (to 30%), whilst stimulating job creation and growth.
The Commission also proposes: i) to simplify and improve the implementation of waste legislation at national level and to reduce the current
disparities; ii) to adopt tailor-made approaches to address particular waste challenges (waste prevention, marine litter, construction and
demolition waste, food waste, hazardous waste and plastic waste).

2014/2208(INI) - 25/06/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety adopted an own-initiative report by Sirpa PIETIKÄINEN (EPP, FI) on
resource efficiency: moving towards a circular economy in response to the Commission communication on the same issue.
Resource efficiency urgency: the unsustainable use of resources is both causing environmental damage and posing an economic risk. The
global economy uses the equivalent of 1.5 planets worth of resources to produce global output and absorb waste. By the 2030s this figure is
estimated to reach two planets. Members stressed that improving resource use through better design requirements, and through waste
legislation that ensures upward movement in the waste hierarchy (thereby fostering waste prevention, reuse, preparation for reuse and
recycling), could bring substantial net savings for EU businesses, public authorities and consumers, estimated at EUR 600 billion, or 8 % of
annual turnover, while also reducing total annual greenhouse gas emissions by 2-4 %. They recalled that resource efficiency is a priority
objective of the 7th Environment Action Programme, which emphasises the need to stimulate production and consumer demand for
environmentally sustainable products and services through policies that promote their availability, affordability, functionality and attractiveness.
In this regard, although endorsing the Commissions approach to designing and innovating for a circular economy, Members stressed that
legislative measures are needed to move towards a circular economy, and called on the Commission to come forward with an ambitious
proposal by the end of 2015.
Indicators and targets: the Commission is urged to propose, by the end of 2015, a lead indicator and a dashboard of sub-indicators on
resource efficiency, including ecosystem services. The use of these harmonised indicators should be legally binding as of 2018. It should also
propose, by the end of 2015, a binding target to increase resource efficiency at EU level by 30 % by 2030 compared with 2014 levels. These
indicators should be included in the European Semester and in all impact assessments.
Product policy and ecodesign: the report stressed the importance of a well-thought-out product policy that increases products expected
lifetime, durability, reusability and recyclability. The Commission is called upon to:
promote a lifecycle-oriented approach in product policies, in particular by establishing harmonised methods for evaluating products
environmental footprints;
present an ambitious work programme, and to comprehensively and ambitiously implement the ecodesign requirements of the existing
Ecodesign Directive in new and updated implementing measures;
propose a review of ecodesign legislation and other relevant product policy legislation by the end of 2016;
develop measures against planned obsolescence and to further develop a set of product standards for the circular economy, which

include refurbishment and repair, facilitating dismantling, and the efficient use of raw materials, renewable resources and recycled
materials in products;
take relevant actions to ensure that products are durable and easy to upgrade, reuse, refit, repair, recycle and dismantle for new
resources;
propose the extension of minimum guarantees for consumer durable goods;
immediately drop its unilateral moratorium on the processing of recommendations by ECHA with regard to the inclusion of substances
of very high concern in Annex XIV to REACH, and instead proceed swiftly with the inclusion of such substances.
For their part, Member States are urged to:
carry out effective market surveillance to ensure that both European and imported products comply with the requirements as regards
product policy and ecodesign;
advance without delay in the legislative procedure on the review of the market surveillance regulation.
Towards zero waste: Members urged the Commission to submit the announced proposal on the review of waste legislation by the end of 2015,
diligently applying the waste hierarchy. This proposal should, inter alia, set binding waste reduction targets for municipal, commercial and
industrial waste to be achieved by 2025.
They also called on the Commission to:
ensure that existing waste legislation and targets are completely and properly implemented, including in particular the obligation of separate
collection schemes;
ensure greater transparency and better controls in order to avoid shipping of waste to countries with lower environmental and social
standards than those in the EU;
propose a target to reduce marine litter by 50 % by 2025 compared with 2014 levels;
propose, by the end of 2015, targets, measures and instruments to efficiently tackle food waste, including setting a binding food waste
reduction target of at least 30 % by 2025 in the manufacturing, retail/distribution, food service/hospitability sectors and the household
sector.
Sustainable buildings: the report called on the Commission to propose the full implementation of the circular economy principles and
requirements in the building sector and to further develop the policy framework on resource efficiency in buildings.
Indoor air quality and the well-being and social needs of users should be integrated into the sustainability assessment of buildings.
Other measures: the Commission is urged to:
propose compulsory green public procurement procedures;
propose measures related to taxation, such as reduced VAT on recycled, reused and resource-efficient products;
present the communication on sustainable food, which has been postponed several times since 2013, during the first half of 2016;
ensure that all EU funding, including funding through the European Fund for Strategic Investment (EFSI), Horizon 2020, cohesion
funds and the European Investment Bank, is mobilised to promote resource efficiency;
examine whether existing and envisaged legislation is hindering the circular economy;
report back to Parliament about all the measures outlined above and to propose next steps by 2018.

2014/2208(INI) - 09/07/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
