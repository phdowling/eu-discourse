2014/0014(COD) - 30/01/2014 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to establish a common legal and financial framework for the distribution of fruit and vegetables and milk to children in schools.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: the School Milk Scheme and the School Fruit Scheme have developed independently and in different time periods: the
School Milk Scheme has been implemented since 1977, and the School Fruit Scheme came out of a political commitment in the context of the
2007 reform of the Common Market Organisation for fruit and vegetables. The current schemes operate within different legal and financial
frameworks, and have some important differences in their design and functioning. The Commission proposes changes to the programmes in
order to make them more efficient, and better respond to the overarching problems of declining fruit and vegetable and milk consumption and
rising obesity.
Furthermore, the Commission made a commitment in the context of the adoption of Council Regulation (EU) No 1370/2013 to review the
financing arrangements of the current schemes, namely aid for the distribution of milk as well as the co-financing of the school fruit scheme
costs.
IMPACT ASSESSMENT: of the three options considered, the option chosen is the "new framework" scenario that entails a considerable policy
change in the form of a common legal and financing framework for the distribution of a restricted number of products, complemented by an
orientation towards the long-term objectives through a strengthened educational dimension of the scheme.
CONTENT: it is proposed to establish a common legal and financial framework for the distribution of fruit and vegetables and milk to children
in schools, supported by strengthened educational measures to reaffirm the link with agriculture, as well as wider issues such as public health
and environmental matters.
The proposal sets out the key elements of the new scheme.
1) Distribution: it is proposed to focus the distribution of products in schools to two "core products": fresh fruit and vegetables (including
bananas) and drinking milk only, with the fat content of drinking milk to be decided upon by national health authorities. The distribution will take
place within a fixed budget, and will help reverse the declining consumption trends for these two groups of products.
2) Unify the financial provisions and improve financing conditions: in view of the differences between the products and their supply chains, as
well as different consumption situation across the Member States, separate "envelopes" would be allocated to Member States for fruit and
vegetables (including bananas) and milk. The envelope for fruit and vegetables is EUR 150 million and the envelope for milk is EUR 80 million.
Certain flexibility is provided for, where Member States can transfer limited shares of their allocations between the envelopes based on their
needs.
Accordingly, without exceeding the global ceiling of EUR 230 million Member States may transfer up to 15% of their indicative allocations for
fruit and vegetables including bananas or for milk to the other sector under conditions to be specified by the Commission by means of
delegated acts
Within the envelopes, thresholds are established for supporting measures and other eligible measures, such as evaluation, monitoring and
communication.
Based on experience gained so far, the level of EU contribution towards the price of products is limited through a maximum EU aid per portion
for fruit and vegetables and for milk, and not through the EU co-financing levels, as was the case for the School Fruit Scheme. This would be a
new element for fruit and vegetables, which would help alleviate the huge disparities in price for products distributed and would imply a
simplification in terms of a management. The level of EU subsidy for milk is increased. Member States will be allowed to continue providing
national top-ups or attract private funding in order to enlarge the scope and/or the intensity of their intervention of the school schemes.
The aid will be allocated to each Member State taking into account certain criteria including (i) the number of six- to ten-year old children as a
proportion of the population, (ii) the degree of development of the regions within a Member State so to ensure higher aid to less developed
regions and (iii) for milk, the historical use of funds.
Reinforce the educational dimension: supporting educational measures will also become a requirement for milk distribution, thus bridging the
gap between the current schemes. These measures will have a focus on agricultural issues, nutrition/health (balanced diets) and
environmental matters and aim to connect children with food, agricultural production and farmers. Member States could choose thematic
educational measures that could occasionally include agricultural products, other than the two core products, such as yoghurts, processed fruit
and vegetables, honey, or olive oil. The list of all products supplied under the scheme and their nutritional aspects have to be approved by
national health authorities. Supporting educational measures would have to be directly linked to the agricultural objectives of the scheme and
be in line with the objective of promoting healthy diets.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the impact of the proposal is budgetary neutral compared to the current situation.
For fruit and vegetables, the budgetary ceiling currently set in Regulation No 1308/2013 ( EUR 150 million per school year) is
maintained in this proposal.
For milk, the proposal includes an envelope of EUR 80 million per school year, corresponding to the expected budget execution and in
line with the overall amounts for market-related expenditure and direct aids taken into account in the Multiannual Financial Framework
2014-2020.
As regards distribution of expenditure, the greatest support will be given to the distribution and supporting educational measures. Other costs,
such as evaluation, monitoring and communication, will also be eligible to a more limited extent.
DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of
the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

2014/0014(COD) - 16/06/2014 Debate in Council
The Greek Presidency of the Union highlights the progress achieved in the first half of 2014 on the proposals for regulations merging the
schemes for the supply of fruit and vegetables, bananas and milk in schools. One of the proposals aims to streamline the existing schemes

with a view to increasing their efficiency and effectiveness and reducing the administrative burden.
The Presidency presented its report on the state of progress with the work on the Commission proposals for regulations merging the schemes
for the supply of fruit and vegetables, bananas and milk in schools.
This progress report can be summarised as follows:
1)

merger of proposals: most of the delegations considered that the choice of a merger of the two schemes was well-grounded and
seems preferable to the option of adjusting to keep the current separate setting while strengthening the school milk scheme
educational dimension and as well as the synergies between the two schemes;

2)

legal basis of the proposals: the delegations unanimously supported the Council Legal Service's view that Article 43(3) TFEU and
not Article 43(2) TFEU - is the correct legal basis for the fixing of the level of aid;

3)

the basic act and the delegated powers: many delegations voiced concerns on the overall balance between the basic act and
delegated acts. They considered that some of the issues for which the Commission had proposed to be empowered to adopt
delegated acts (for example, how the criteria for the allocation of funds would be applied or the conditions for the transfers of
allocations between the two components of the scheme) were essential provisions to be regulated in the basic act. Delegations also
pointed out that the issue of the legal basis has an impact on the general architecture of delegated and implementing acts of the
proposal;

4)

objective and the scope of the programme: in general, delegations shared the objective of merging the school schemes, thus
increasing their efficiency and effectiveness and consolidating the legal and financial framework. They also confirmed the original
objectives of the schemes, i.e., the promotion of the consumption of fruit, vegetables and milk, underlying the nutritional benefits for
children. However, while a few delegations could support a narrow list of products for regular distribution as suggested by the
Commission, many others considered the proposed scope unsatisfactory and preferred the scope of the existing schemes, in
particular, those relating to dairy products. Among the delegations wishing an extension of the scope,several called for dairy
products other than drinking milk - notably cheese, yoghurt, lactose - free milk - to be considered. Several delegations also called for
processed fruit and vegetables (notably fresh juices). A few also asked for honey, table olives and olive oil to be included. A number
of delegations made it clear that an enlarged scope could not justify an increased budget;

5)

financing provisions: if most delegations could support the amount of the total envelopes for fruit and vegetable, including bananas,
and for milk, the criteria for the allocation of Union aid were discussed extensively. On the financial provisions, most delegations
could support the amount of the total envelopes for fruit and vegetable, including bananas, and for milk. However a few delegations
considered the proposed EU aid for milk (80 million euros for school year) to be inadequate. Moreover, several delegations
contested the choice of the criterion of the historical use of funds under previous schemes for the supply of milk and milk products to
children to determine the milk envelope. They considered that it could be detrimental to those Member States that so far had not fully
benefited from the school milk scheme or had no historical record having joined the EU only recently. However, a number of other
delegations considered the criterion of the historical use of funds particularly important to ensure that there would be no disruption in
the functioning of the school milk scheme in their Member State. Some delegations contesting this criterion suggested using the
same criteria as that used for fruit and vegetables, i.e., the number of children and the degree of development of the regions within a
Member State. They stressed that this would further simplify of the scheme. Eventually, the Greek Presidency noted the Commission
intention to further consider the specific situation of Member States such as those that joined the EU very recently and that therefore
have no historical record of the use of milk funds. Finally, a few delegations insisted on the need to take into account the specificities
of small Member States and fix minimum envelopes of aid (as it is now the case of the school fruit scheme). The Commission
showed some understanding for their request. These minimum envelopes should be fixed in the basic act and not through delegated
acts.

6)

reduction of the administrative burden: finally, several delegations remained to be convinced that the merged scheme would not
increase the administrative burden both for national administrations and schools, notably in relation to the mandatory supporting
educational measures, the involvement of national health authorities, national strategies, monitoring and reporting, price monitoring
or the necessity to prove the added value of EU aid. The delegations notably called for national strategies to remain simple and for
requirements to remain proportionate. The Greek Presidency noted the suggestions made by delegations on how to simplify the
determination of the level of Union aid.

The European Parliament is expected to start its work on the proposal in autumn 2014.

2014/0014(COD) - 15/01/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development adopted the report by Marc TARABELLA (S&D, BE) on the proposal for a regulation of
the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 as regards the aid
scheme for the supply of fruit and vegetables, bananas and milk in the educational establishments.
The committee recommended that the European Parliaments position, adopted at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure,
should amend the Commission proposal as follows:
Promoting healthy eating habits: in the current context of declining consumption of fresh fruit and vegetables and milk products, especially
among children, and of an increasing incidence of child obesity as a result of consumption habits geared to highly processed foods which,
additionally, are often high in added sugars, salt, fat or additives, Members insisted on Union aid to finance the supply to children in
educational establishments of selected agricultural products should do more to promote healthy eating habits and the consumption of local
products.
Participation in the aid scheme and eligible products: Member States wishing to participate in the aid scheme shall prioritise the distribution of
products of either or both of the following groups:
fruit and vegetables and fresh products of banana sector;
drinking milk and its lactose-free versions.

However, in order to promote the consumption of specific products and/or to respond to particular nutritional needs of children in its territory, a
Member State may provide for the distribution of:
processed fruit and vegetable products in addition to fruit and vegetables and fresh products of banana sector;
cheese and curd, yoghurt and other fermented or acidified milk products without added flavouring, fruit, nuts or cocoa in addition to
drinking milk and its lactose-free versions.
Member States may additionally complement the distribution of fermented milk products without fruit juice, naturally flavoured, or with fruit
juice, naturally flavoured or non-flavoured or milk-based drinks with cocoa, fruit juice or naturally flavoured (category I) or naturally flavoured
and non-flavoured milk products with fruit, fermented or not (category II).
In such case the Union aid shall be paid only for the milk component of the distributed product which shall not be lower than 90% by weight for
Category I of Annex V and 75% by weight for Category II of Annex V.
Products distributed under the school scheme shall not contain added sugars, added salt, added fat, added sweeteners and added artificial
flavour enhancers E 620 to E 650.
However, any Member State may decide that eligible products may contain limited quantities of added sugar, added salt, and/or added fat
after obtaining the appropriate authorisation of their national authorities responsible for health and nutrition in line with their national
procedures.
Financing provisions: the aid under the school scheme allocated for the distribution of products, the accompanying educational measures and
the related costs shall not exceed EUR 250 million per school year, of which:
for school fruit and vegetables: EUR 150 million per school year;
for school milk: EUR 100 million per school year.
The amended text also provides that:
without exceeding the global ceiling of EUR 250 million resulting from the amounts referred to under points (a) and (b) of paragraph 1,
any Member State may transfer once per school year up to 20% of one or the other of its indicative allocations. However, that
percentage may be increased up to 25% for the Member States with outermost regions and in other duly justified cases, such as
where a Member State needs to address specific market situation in the sector covered by the school scheme, its particular concerns
of low consumption of one or the other group of products, or other societal changes;
Union aid may be used to extend the scope or effectiveness of any existing national school schemes or school distribution schemes
providing school fruit and vegetables and school milk but shall not replace funding for these existing national schemes, except for free
distribution of meals to children in educational establishments;
Member States may finance those payments by means of a levy on the sector concerned or by any other contribution from the private
sector;
the Union may also finance information, publicity, monitoring and evaluation measures relating to the school scheme, including raising
public awareness of its objectives, and related networking measures aimed at exchanging experience and best practices in order to
facilitate the implementation and management of the scheme.
Accompanying educational measures: these measures represent a critical tool to reconnect children with agriculture and the variety of Union
agricultural products, particularly those produced in their region, with the help of, for example, nutrition experts and farmers.
Moreover, Member States should be allowed to include in their thematic measures a wider variety of agricultural products, such as processed
fruit and vegetables without the addition of sugar, salt, fat, sweeteners and artificial flavours enhancers. Member States should also be allowed
to include other local, regional or national specialities, such as honey, table olives and olive oil.
Visibility of Union aid: in order to promote awareness of the school scheme and to increase the visibility of Union aid, the power to adopt
certain acts should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the obligation by Member States to clearly publicise the Union support for
implementing the scheme including in relation to publicity tools and, if appropriate, the common identifier or graphic elements.

2014/0014(COD) - 08/03/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 584 votes to 94, with 32 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 as regards the aid
scheme for the supply of fruit and vegetables, bananas and milk in the educational establishments.
Parliaments position, adopted at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure, amended the Commission proposal as follows:
Strengthen EU aid schemes: the amended text stressed the importance of the continuation and strengthening of the two school schemes in
the current context of declining consumption of fresh fruit and vegetables and milk products, especially among children, and of an increasing
incidence of child obesity as a result of consumption habits geared to highly processed foods which, in addition, are often high in added
sugars, salt, fat or additives. Parliament stressed the fact that the Union aid should finance the supply to children in educational establishments
of selected agricultural products should do more to promote healthy eating habits and the consumption of local products.
Participation in the aid scheme and eligible products: Member States wishing to participate in the aid scheme shall prioritise the distribution of
products of either or both of the following groups:
fruit and vegetables and fresh products of banana sector;
drinking milk and its lactose-free versions.
However, in order to promote the consumption of specific products and/or to respond to particular nutritional needs of children in its territory, a
Member State may provide for the distribution of:
processed fruit and vegetable products in addition to fruit and vegetables and fresh products of banana sector;
cheese and curd, yoghurt and other fermented or acidified milk products without added flavouring, fruit, nuts or cocoa in addition to

drinking milk and its lactose-free versions.
Member States may additionally complement the distribution of fermented milk products without fruit juice, naturally flavoured, or with fruit
juice, naturally flavoured or non-flavoured or milk-based drinks with cocoa, fruit juice or naturally flavoured (category I) or naturally flavoured
and non-flavoured milk products with fruit, fermented or not (category II).
In such case the Union aid shall be paid only for the milk component of the distributed product which shall not be lower than 90% by weight for
Category I of Annex V and 75% by weight for Category II of Annex V.
Elements excluded from the products distributed: products distributed under the school scheme shall not contain any of the following: added
sugars; added salt; added fat; added sweeteners; added artificial flavour enhancers E 620 to E 650.
However, any Member State may decide that eligible products may contain limited quantities of added sugar, added salt, and/or added fat
after obtaining the appropriate authorisation of their national authorities responsible for health and nutrition in line with their national
procedures.
Financing provisions: the aid under the school scheme allocated for the distribution of products, the accompanying educational measures and
the related costs shall not exceed EUR 250 million per school year, of which:
for school fruit and vegetables: EUR 150 million per school year;
for school milk: EUR 100 million per school year.
That aid should be allocated to each Member State taking into account the number of six- to ten-year-old children in that Member State and
the degree of development of the regions within that Member State, so as to ensure that higher aid is allocated to less developed regions.
As regards school milk, the historical use of the Union aid for the supply of milk and milk products to children should be taken into account.
All Member States are entitled to receive at least a minimum amount of Union aid per child.
The amended text also provides that:
without exceeding the global ceiling of EUR 250 million, any Member State may transfer once per school year up to 20% of one or the
other of its indicative allocations. However, that percentage may be increased up to 25% for the Member States with outermost
regions and in other duly justified cases, such as where a Member State needs to address specific market situation in the sector
covered by the school scheme, its particular concerns of low consumption of one or the other group of products, or other societal
changes;
Union aid may be used to extend the scope or effectiveness of any existing national school schemes or school distribution schemes
providing school fruit and vegetables and school milk but shall not replace funding for these existing national schemes, except for free
distribution of meals to children in educational establishments;
Member States may finance those payments by means of a levy on the sector concerned or by any other contribution from the private
sector;
the Union may also finance information, publicity, monitoring and evaluation measures relating to the school scheme, including raising
public awareness of its objectives, and related networking measures aimed at exchanging experience and best practices in order to
facilitate the implementation and management of the scheme.
Accompanying educational measures: these measure may:
provide for accompanying educational measures, which may include, inter alia, measures and activities aimed at reconnecting
children with agriculture through activities, such as farm visits, and the distribution of a wider variety of agricultural products;
be designed to educate children about related issues, such as healthy eating habits, local food chains, organic farming, sustainable
production or combating food waste.
Visibility of Union aid: the power to adopt delegated acts should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the obligation by Member States
to clearly publicise the Union support for implementing the scheme, including in relation to publicity tools and, if appropriate, the common
identifier or graphic elements. Member States participating in the school scheme shall publicise, at school premises or other relevant places,
their involvement in the scheme and the fact that it is subsidised by the Union. Member States may use any suitable publicity tools, which may
include posters, dedicated websites, informative graphic material, and information and awareness-raising campaigns.

2014/0014(COD) - 11/05/2016 Final act
PURPOSE: to promote the consumption of fruit and vegetables in schools.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Regulation (EU) 2016/791 of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulations (EU) No 1308/2013 and
(EU) No 1306/2013 as regards the aid scheme for the supply of fruit and vegetables, bananas and milk in educational establishments
CONTENT: the Regulation amends Regulations (EU) No 1308/2013 and (EU) No 1306/2013 in order to put in place a new framework for the
support of distribution of fruit and vegetables, bananas and milk to children in educational establishments, and includes provisions on the
amount of the Union aid, and the method of allocation in Member States.
Promotion of healthy food: experience gained showed that continuation and strengthening of the two school schemes is of great importance, in
particular in the current context of declining consumption of fresh fruit and vegetables and milk products, especially among children, and of an
increasing incidence of child obesity as a result of unhealthy consumption habits, often high in added sugars, salt, fat or additives.
Accordingly, the Union aid to finance the supply to children in educational establishments of selected agricultural products aims to promote
healthy eating habits and the consumption of local products.
Participation in the school scheme and eligible products: participation in the school scheme should continue to be voluntary for Member
States, taking into account the different consumption patterns across Member States.

Member States wishing to participate in the aid scheme shall prioritise the distribution of products of either or both of the following groups:
fruit and vegetables and fresh products of the banana sector;
drinking milk and lactose-free versions thereof.
However, in order to promote the consumption of specific products and/or to respond to particular nutritional needs of children in their territory,
Member States may provide for the distribution of:
processed fruit and vegetable products, in addition to fresh fruit and vegetables;
cheese, curd, yoghurt and other fermented or acidified milk products without added flavouring, fruit, nuts or cocoa, in addition to milk
and lactose-free milk.
As a condition for its participation in the school scheme, a Member State shall draw up, prior to its participation in the school scheme, and
subsequently every six years, at national or regional level, a strategy for the implementation of the scheme.
Elements excluded from products distributed: the amending Regulation specifies that products distributed under the school scheme shall not
contain added sugars, added salt, added fat, added sweeteners, or added artificial flavour enhancers E 620 to E 650.
Funding: the new scheme will have an overall yearly budget of EUR 250 million (milk products: EUR 100 million; fruit and vegetables: EUR
150 million). The EU contribution is allocated to Member States for the supply of these products in educational establishments. Union aid shall
not replace funding for those existing national schemes, except for free distribution of meals to children in educational establishments.
The aid should be allocated to each Member State taking into account the number of six- to ten-year-old children in that Member State and the
degree of development of the regions within that Member State. Higher aid should be allocated to less developed regions, to the smaller
Aegean Islands and to the outermost regions.
Accompanying educational measures: Member States shall determine in their strategies the list of all the products to be supplied under the
school scheme either through regular distribution or under accompanying educational measures.
These measures may:
include, inter alia, measures aimed at reconnecting children with agriculture through activities, such as farm visits, and the distribution
of a wider variety of agricultural products with the help, for example, of nutrition experts and farmers;
be designed to educate children about related issues, such as healthy eating habits, local food chains, organic farming, sustainable
production or combating food waste.
Visibility of aid: the Commission may adopt delegated acts to clearly publicise Union support for implementing the scheme, including in relation
to publicity tools and the common identifier or graphic elements.
Member States participating in the school scheme shall publicise, at school premises or other relevant places, their involvement in the scheme
and the fact that it is subsidised by the Union. They may use any suitable publicity tools, which may include posters, dedicated websites,
informative graphic material, and information and awareness-raising campaigns
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 13.6.2016.
APPLICATION: from 1.8.2017.
DELEGATED ACTS: the Commission may adopt delegated acts in respect of supplementing the list of excluded flavour enhancers set out in
the Regulation and defining the maximum levels for added sugar, added salt and added fat in processed products, to ensure the efficient and
targeted use of Union funds, the drawing up of the national or regional strategies and on the accompanying educational measures, the
identification of costs and measures that are eligible for Union aid, and to promote awareness of the school scheme and to increase the
visibility of Union aid.
