2014/0332(NLE) - 12/11/2014 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to amend Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1150/2000 implementing Decision 2007/436/EC, Euratom on the system of the European
Communities' own resources.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to
follow its opinion.
BACKGROUND: pursuant to Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1150/2000, the Commission should calculate and inform Member States of
adjustments to the own resources referred to in Council Decision 2007/436/EC, Euratom - VAT resources and the Gross National Income
(GNI) based own resource -, in time for them to enter these adjustments in the Commission?s account on the first working day of December.
These adjustments vary from year to year. Under exceptional circumstances these adjustments may result in very high amounts which may
exceed substantially, as regards some Member States, two monthly twelfths to be made available as VAT resources and the additional
resource, and in total, for all Member States, half of aggregate monthly twelfths.
For some Member States the obligation to make available such high amounts may represent a high financial burden which may cause a
severe fiscal strain on the country, particularly towards the end of the year.
According to the current rules in Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1150/2000, these adjustments have to be made available on the first working

day of December. There is no discretion to agree on a later date.
CONTENT: the proposal aims to amend Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1150/2000 in order to provide Member States with the possibility to
make available the amount resulting from these adjustments (the VAT and GNI balances) at any moment between the first working day of
December and the first working day of September of the following year in the following cases: excess of the individual threshold and or excess
of the general threshold.
According to the proposal :
any Member State which decides to apply this option should inform the Commission well in advance of the first working day of
December of the date or dates of making available the adjustments, in order to allow an efficient management of the Union?s cash
requirements;
any delay in making available those adjustments on the date or dates communicated to the Commission should give rise to interest
under the conditions of Article 11 of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1150/2000.
This option should be applicable for the first time for adjustments which, pursuant to Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1150/2000, would have to
be entered in the Commission?s accounts on the first working day of December 2014.
Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1150/2000 will be retroactively repealed by Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 609/2014. Therefore, the amendments
made by this proposal would need to be taken into due consideration in the context of the proposal to amend Regulation (EU, Euratom) No
609/2014, which the Commission has committed to present by the end of March 2015.

2014/0332(NLE) - 27/11/2014 Court of Auditors: opinion, report
Opinion No 7/2014 of the COURT OF AUDITORS
The Court takes note of the Commission's proposal amending Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1150/2000 to allow deferred payments of VAT
and GNI balances and adjustments in case of exceptional circumstances. While this proposed amendment does not tackle the issue of
Member States' budgetary uncertainty which remains a risk in the current system of own resources, the Court acknowledges that the VAT and
GNI balances and adjustments may result in exceptionally large amounts, as occurred in 2014.
It draws attention, however, to the fact that this provision may increase the complexity of the system of own resources and the Member States'
budgetary uncertainty. The Court therefore considers that this proposal should be completed to address the observations raised by the Court
in the context of the entry into force of the new Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 609/2014.The amended Regulation should thus set a common
pre-determined schedule for these deferred payments in order to limit uncertainty in respect of the dates, the number of instalments and the
amounts.

2014/0332(NLE) - 12/12/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Budgets adopted (Parliaments consultation) the report by Gérard DEPREZ (ALDE, BE) and Janusz LEWANDOWSKI
(EPP, PL) on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1150/2000 implementing Decision 2007/436/EC,
Euratom on the system of the European Communities' own resources.
In its motion for a legislative resolution, the committee underlined that this proposal to amend Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1150/2000 finds its
origin in the one-off consequences of the application of that Regulation for certain Member States. It appeared that a number of Member
States underpaid their due contributions to the Union budget over a number of years, while others overpaid theirs.
Certain Member States which had benefited from past underestimation of their GNI expressed their reluctance to pay by the legal deadline the
additional amounts due.
In accordance with the on-going legislative revision, seven Member States decided not to enter in the EU account their respective GNI and
VAT balances on the first working day of December 2014.
Members deplored that the issue of the deferral of national contributions adjustments took precedence, within the Council, over finding a
negotiating position on the 2014 and 2015 budgetary negotiations, which was only established on the final day of the 21-day conciliation
period provided for in Article 314 TFEU and contributed to the failure of the Conciliation Committee to reach an agreement.
The Committee on Budgets was concerned by the proposed larger discretion left to Member States as to the timing of their additional
contributions resulting from GNI adjustments to the Union budget. According to Members, this has created a precedent that could have an
impact on the Commission's treasury, the timing of payments to the beneficiaries of the Union budget and, ultimately, the credibility of the
Union's budget.
Members stressed the fact that this proposal makes the Own Resources system even more complex and is aimed at amending legislation that
will soon be replaced, retroactively, by already agreed pieces of legislation. In this regard, they highlighted the crucial role of the High Level
Group on Own Resources in delivering proposals for overcoming the deficiencies of the current system.
The committee acknowledged nevertheless the exceptionally high amounts of 2014 adjustments in the VAT- and GNI-based own resources,
which may represent a high financial burden for certain Member States. In this context, it recommended that the European Parliament approve
the proposal as amended:
According to the proposal, Members States may only apply the provisions of the amended Regulation if they have informed the
Commission before the first working day of December of their decision, and of the date or dates of entry of the amount of the
adjustments in the account referred to in this Regulation. Members specified that the Commission shall notify the European Parliament
and the Council of any such decision, including the concerned Member States, the number of instalments, the amount of each
instalment and the dates of entry in the accounts.
As regards the operations which constitute modifications to revenue in respect of the financial year in which they occur, the

Commission shall report to the European Parliament and the Council on the modifications of revenue under this Regulation.

2014/0332(NLE) - 17/12/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 566 votes to 73, with 66 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a Council regulation
amending Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1150/2000 implementing Decision 2007/436/EC, Euratom on the system of the European
Communities' own resources.
It is recalled that the exceptionally high amounts of 2014 adjustments in the VAT- and GNI-based own resources , may represent a high
financial burden for certain Member States.
Parliament emphasized that the Commission proposal is part of a wider negotiation package including the 2014 amending budgets and 2015
Budget.
In this context, Parliament approved the proposal as amended:
According to the proposal, Members States may only apply the provisions of the amended Regulation if they have informed the
Commission before the first working day of December of their decision, and of the date or dates of entry of the amount of the
adjustments in the account referred to in this Regulation. Members specified that the Commission shall notify the European Parliament
and the Council of any such decision, including the concerned Member States, the number of instalments, the amount of each
instalment and the dates of entry in the accounts.
As regards the operations which constitute modifications to revenue in respect of the financial year in which they occur, the
Commission shall report to the European Parliament and the Council on the modifications of revenue under this Regulation.
In its legislative resolution, Parliament deplored that the issue of the deferral of national contributions adjustments took precedence, within the
Council, over finding a negotiating position on the 2014 and 2015 budgetary negotiations. Moreover, it is also concerned by the proposed
larger discretion left to Member States as to the timing of their additional contributions resulting from GNI adjustments to the Union budget.
Members stressed that this creates a precedent that could have an impact on the Commission's treasury and the credibility of the Union's
budget.
Parliament also stressed the fact that this proposal makes the Own Resources system even more complex and is aimed at amending
legislation that will soon be replaced, retroactively, by already agreed pieces of legislation. It underlined, against this background, the crucial
role of the High Level Group on Own Resources in delivering proposals for overcoming the deficiencies of the current system.
