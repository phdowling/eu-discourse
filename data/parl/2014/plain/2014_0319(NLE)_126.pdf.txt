2014/0319(NLE) - 31/10/2014 Initial legislative proposal

PURPOSE: to conclude the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for in the Fisheries Partnership
Agreement between the European Community and Madagascar.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: on the basis of the powers conferred on it by the Council, the European Commission has conducted negotiations with
Madagascar with a view to renewing the Protocol to the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and this country.
At the end of the negotiations a new draft protocol was initialled by the negotiators on 19 June 2014.
It is now necessary to conclude the Protocol on behalf of the European Union.
CONTENT: this proposal calls on the Council to conclude, on behalf of the Union, the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and the
financial contribution provided for by the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and Madagascar.
Objectives: the primary objective of the Protocol to the Agreement is to grant fishing opportunities to EU vessels in the fishing zone of the
Republic of Madagascar, in line with the management measures adopted by the relevant Regional Fisheries Management Organisation,
namely the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) and where relevant, in keeping within the limits of the available surplus.
The general objective is to enhance cooperation between the European Union and Madagascar, thereby creating a partnership framework
within which to develop a sustainable fisheries policy and sound exploitation of fishery resources in the fishing zone of Madagascar, in the
interests of both parties.
Financial contribution: the annual financial contribution, which is EUR 1 566 250 for each of the first two years of the Protocol and EUR 1 487
500 for each of the following two years, is based on:
a reference tonnage of 15 750 tonnes linked to access, for an annual amount of EUR 866 250 for each of the first two years of the
Protocol and EUR 787 500 for each of the following two years;
support for the development of the sectoral fisheries policy of Madagascar, amounting to EUR 700 000 per year. This support meets
the objectives of the national fisheries policy and in particular the needs of the Republic of Madagascar in the fight against illegal
fishing.
In the event of the annual amount of catches of the species referred to the Protocol exceeds the reference tonnage of 15 750 tonnes, the
amount of the annual financial contribution shall be increased by EUR 55 during the first two years of the Protocol, and EUR 50 during the last
two years for each additional tonne caught.
However, the annual amount paid by the European Union in respect of access to Madagascar?s fishing zone shall not be more than twice the
amount of the tonnage reference for the corresponding year. If the amounts caught by European Union vessels in Madagascar?s fishing zone
exceed a quantity corresponding to twice that total annual amount, the amount due in respect of the quantity exceeding that limit shall be paid
the following year.
Fishing opportunities: the Protocol provides for fishing opportunities in the following categories:
40 tuna seiners;
32 surface longliners with a tonnage greater than 100 GT;
22 surface longliners with a tonnage less than or equal to 100 GT.
New fishing opportunities: the new fishing opportunities and technical measures may be reviewed by mutual agreement within the Joint
Committee. They may be adjusted by the Joint Committee insofar as the resolutions and recommendations adopted by the IOTC confirm that
such adjustments guarantee the sustainable management of the fish species covered by this Protocol. In this case, the financial contribution
shall be adjusted proportionately and pro rata temporis.
Exploratory fishing surveys may be authorised in the Malagasy fishing zone to test the technical feasibility and economic viability of new
fisheries.
Duration of the Agreement: the new Protocol covers a period of four years from the date of provisional application ? i.e. from the date of its
signature and 1 January 2015 at the earliest.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the total financial envelope allocated to this Protocol amounts to EUR 6.602 million from 2015 to 2018, including
administrative management costs and human resources.

2014/0319(NLE) - 09/12/2014 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude a Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for in the Fisheries Partnership
Agreement between the Madagascar and the European Community.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: the European Union negotiated with Madagascar a new protocol to the partnership agreement granting Union vessels fishing
possibilities in the fishing zone over which Madagascar has jurisdiction. The Protocol was signed in accordance with a Council Decision and
has been applied on a provisional basis.
The Protocol should now be approved.
CONTENT: under this draft Decision, the Council is called upon to approve a Protocol between setting out the fishing opportunities and the
financial contribution provided for by the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between Madagascar and the EC on behalf of the Union.

The Protocol aims to set out the conditions under which ships flying under a EU flag might fish in the waters off Madagascar.
For more details on the fishing possibilities and financial contributions to be paid from the EU budget under the Protocol, please refer to the
summary of the Commissions initial legislative proposal of 31/10/2014.
Simplified procedure for determining the EUs position in the Joint Committee: the agreement establishes a Joint Committee to see to the
application of the agreement. In accordance with the Protocol, the Joint committee may approve certain amendments to the Protocol. In order
to ensure approval of the amendments, the Commission is empowered, under certain conditions, to approve them in accordance with a
simplified procedure.
Annex: the draft decision sets out the extent of the powers conferred on the Commission as well as the procedure for establishing the Unions
position in the Joint Committee. The Commission is authorised to negotiate amendments on the following topics with Madagascar:
·

review of fishing opportunities, as well as the review of the financial contribution and amendments of the Protocol and the Annex;

·

determining fishing possibilities in accordance with the Protocol;

·

a decision on the detailed arrangements of the sectoral support;

·

adoption of measures to ensure sustainable fishing resources covered by the Protocol and affecting the activities of fishing vessels of
the Union;

·

amendment of the provisions relating to conditions governing fishing activities and the rules on the implementation of the Protocol
and the Annexes

In the Joint Committee, the Union will act in accordance with the objectives pursued by the Union within the framework of the Common
Fisheries Policy, as well as promote positions that are consistent with the relevant rules adopted by Regional Fisheries Management
Organisations. The Joint Committee must base decisions on the latest statistical, biological and other relevant information transmitted to the
Commission.
Technical provisions are set out to establish the framework and practical methods for approving the said amendments to the Protocol.

2014/0319(NLE) - 19/06/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Fisheries adopted the recommendation by Ricardo SERRÃO SANTOS (S&D, PT) on the draft Council decision on the
conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for in
the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the Republic of Madagascar and the European Community.
Members called on the European Parliament to give its consent to the conclusion of the Protocol.
Members welcomed the Protocol but considered that further measures should be taken to ensure a better monitoring of the implementation
such as transmitting relevant information to Parliament on the joint scientific meetings provided for in the Partnership Agreement and on the
changes to fishing conditions. The Commission is also asked to present to Parliament and to the Council, during the last year of the Protocol's
validity and before the opening of negotiations for its renewal, an ex-post evaluation report on its implementation.
