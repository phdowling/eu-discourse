2014/2219(INI) - 03/03/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Foreign Affairs adopted the own-initiative report by Elmar BROK (EPP, DE) on the Annual Report from the High
Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to the European Parliament.
The report pointed to the dramatically aggravated security environment around the EU, especially in its immediate neighbourhood, where the
international law-based order and stability and security of Europe were challenged to a degree unprecedented since the beginning of
European integration.
Due to its internal crisis, the EU had so far not been able to use its full potential to shape the international political and security environment,
and a lack of policy coordination and coherence between EU policies, and financial limitations, posed additional restraints on Europes
influence in the world.
The report contained the following principal recommendations:
The EU as a credible actor: Members believed that an ambitious and effective EU foreign policy needed to be based on a shared vision of key
European interests, values and objectives in external relations and on a common perception of the threats affecting the EU as a whole.
The political, economic, financial and defence resources of the EU and its Member States must be strengthened and combined in order to
maximise the EUs influence in the world, produce synergies and ensure peace and stability in Europe and its neighbourhood.
Members took the view that the Council and the Commission, with the active cooperation of the Member States, need to ensure the coherence
and consistency of internal and external policies pursued by the EU, including the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), the Common
Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) and the policies relating to neighbourhood, trade, development, humanitarian aid, justice and home
affairs, energy, the environment, and migration.
The report called for
·

enhanced cooperation and coordination between the different EU-level monitoring and crisis response capacities;

·

exploring means to improve external policy coherence, notably in relation to human rights and international law;

·

promoting the creation of a European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB), by fostering cooperation concerning the
development of defence capabilities,

·

better coordination of efforts to respond to terrorist attacks in the EU by stepping up the sharing of security-related intelligence.

Preserving and strengthening the European political and legal order: the report underlined the need to consolidate the EU and to strengthen its
integration capacity. It took the view that an overarching political strategy was needed aimed at restoring the European political order under
international law binding all European states, including Russia.
Supporting those countries that wanted to draw closer to the EU must be a top priority for EU foreign policy and an important response for
containing Russias ambitions in its neighbourhood was to invest in the independence, sovereignty, economic development and further
democratisation of these countries.
Strongly condemning the fact that Russia had broken international law through its direct military aggression and hybrid war against Ukraine,
Members called on the HR/VP to develop, as a matter of priority, a common EU strategy on Russia, aimed at securing a commitment from
Russia on peace and stability in Europe including unconditional respect for its neighbours sovereignty and territorial integrity.
Supporting security and stabilisation in the southern neighbourhood: the Union needed substantially to revise the EU´s policy towards its
southern neighbourhood. Members stressed the need for a comprehensive strategy focusing the EUs instruments and resources on support
for the building of functioning and inclusive states capable of delivering security for their citizens, promoting democracy, confronting religious
extremism, and respecting human rights.

The EU leadership was urged to develop, in close coordination with the US and involving major powers (e.g. Russia and China), a strategy
encouraging regional actors (including Turkey, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Egypt, the Gulf Cooperation Council governments, Iran, the Arab League
and Kurdish forces) to unite in order to put an end to proxy wars and halt financial support for fundamentalists, and to develop a solution for
peace and stability in the region particularly with a view to ending the war in Syria and Iraq.
Strengthening a cooperative, rule-based global order: Members believed that EU-NATO cooperation should be strengthened and closer
planning and coordination undertaken between NATOs smart defence and the EUs pooling and sharing, in order to avoid duplication and
make best use of the scarce resources available. They underlined the need for an EU strategy, in coordination with the US, on how to share
with Russia, China, India and other major powers the responsibility for the peace and stability of the global political and economic order.
The report reasserted the need for a reform of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), for the latter to better reflect today´s global
realities. It stressed, in this respect, that the EU should become a full member of the UN.

2014/2219(INI) - 12/03/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 436 votes to 145 with 64 abstentions, a resolution on the Annual Report from the High Representative of
the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to the European Parliament.
Parliament pointed to the dramatically aggravated security environment around the EU, especially in its immediate neighbourhood, where the
international law-based order and stability and security of Europe were challenged to a degree unprecedented since the beginning of
European integration.
Due to its internal crisis, the EU had so far not been able to use its full potential to shape the international political and security environment,
and a lack of policy coordination and coherence between EU policies, and financial limitations, posed additional restraints on Europes
influence in the world.
In this context, the priority tasks for EU foreign and security policy should be:
·

protecting European values and interests and enforcing the political and legal order in Europe, thereby restoring and safeguarding
peace and stability;

·

improving the EUs contribution to the territorial defence of its Member States and the security of its citizens by strengthening its
ability to defend itself against the threats facing it, including terrorism and arms, drug and human trafficking;

·

supporting security, democratisation, the rule of law and economic and social development in the EUs neighbourhood;

·

taking a leading role in the resolution of conflicts, including through peacekeeping and peace enforcement in the context of CSDP;

·

strengthening, together with its partners, the rules-based, pluralistic global political, economic and financial order, including respect
for the rule of law and human rights; and

·

improving the EUs internal structures and working methods in order to strengthen its resilience and allow it to unleash its full
potential as a global player.

The resolution contained the following principal recommendations:
The EU as a credible actor: Members believed that an ambitious and effective EU foreign policy needed to be based on a shared vision of key
European interests, values and objectives in external relations and on a common perception of the threats affecting the EU as a whole.
Parliament welcomed the commitment of the HR/VP, to initiate as a matter of priority a process of strategic reflection on the EUs foreign and
security policy, which should lead to a new European Security Strategy.
The political, economic, financial and defence resources of the EU and its Member States must be strengthened and combined in order to
maximise the EUs influence in the world, produce synergies and ensure peace and stability in Europe and its neighbourhood.
Parliament particularly called for:
·

reform of the internal structures of the EEAS so as to enable it to assist the HR/VP in all her roles;

·

enhanced cooperation and coordination between the different EU-level monitoring and crisis response capacities;

·

exploring means to improve external policy coherence, notably in relation to human rights and international law;

·

strengthening the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base, inter alia by coordinating defence budgets, harmonising
requirements, reducing inefficiencies and creating synergies;

·

developing the industrial and technological resources needed to improve cybersecurity;

·

a renewed and coherent EU migration policy;

·

building a European Energy Union with a solidarity mechanism in order to deal with possible energy disruptions;

·

better coordination of efforts to respond to terrorist attacks in the EU by stepping up the sharing of security-related intelligence.

Preserving and strengthening the European political and legal order: underlining the need to consolidate the EU and to strengthen its
integration capacity, Parliament took the view that an overarching political strategy was needed aimed at restoring the European political order
under international law binding all European states, including Russia. It recommended a new approach to the EUs relations with its eastern
neighbours, based on merits.
Supporting those countries that wanted to draw closer to the EU must be a top priority for EU foreign policy and an important response for
containing Russias ambitions in its neighbourhood was to invest in the independence, sovereignty, economic development and further
democratisation of these countries.
Strongly condemning the fact that Russia had broken international law through its direct military aggression and hybrid war against Ukraine,

Parliament called on the HR/VP to develop, as a matter of priority, a common EU strategy on Russia, aimed at securing a commitment from
Russia on peace and stability in Europe including unconditional respect for its neighbours sovereignty and territorial integrity.
The comprehensive agreement in Minsk on 12th February 2015 must be immediately implemented and sanctions strengthened should Russia
continue to fail to meet its international obligations.
Supporting security and stabilisation in the southern neighbourhood: Parliament stressed the need for a comprehensive strategy focusing the
EUs instruments and resources on support for the building of functioning and inclusive states capable of delivering security for their citizens,
promoting democracy, confronting religious extremism, and respecting human rights.
In view of the threat posed by terrorist jihadists groups engaged in and associated with the so-called Islamic State (IS) to the wider Middle East
and North Africa region, to Europe, and potentially to global peace and stability, Parliament supported the global coalition against IS and its
efforts to combat IS militarily. It urged the stepping-up of resolute global regulatory pressure to deprive jihadists of oil revenues and pointed to
the urgent need to counter jihadist groups use of the internet for recruitment and propaganda.
Strengthening a cooperative, rule-based global order: stating that the US was the EUs key strategic partner, Members believed that EU-NATO
cooperation should be strengthened and closer planning and coordination undertaken between NATOs smart defence and the EUs pooling
and sharing, in order to avoid duplication and make best use of the scarce resources available. They underlined the need for an EU strategy,
in coordination with the US, on how to share with Russia, China, India and other major powers the responsibility for the peace and stability of
the global political and economic order.
They also called for the development of a coherent climate security strategy at EU level.
Lastly, Parliament reasserted the need for a reform of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), for the latter to better reflect today´s global
realities. It stressed, in this respect, that the EU should become a full member of the UN.
