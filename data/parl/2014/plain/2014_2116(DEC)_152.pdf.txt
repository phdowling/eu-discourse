2014/2116(DEC) - 01/07/2014 Court of Auditors: opinion, report
PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) for the year
2013, together with the Agencys reply.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit concerned, amongst others, the annual accounts of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA).
Statement of assurance: pursuant to the provisions of Article 287 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the Court
has audited:
the annual accounts of the Agency, which comprise the financial statements and the reports on the implementation of the budget for
the financial year ended 31 December 2013;
the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying those accounts.
Opinion on the reliability of the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the Agencys annual accounts present fairly, in all material respects, its
financial position as at 31 December 2013 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the
provisions of its Financial Regulation and the accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
Opinion on the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the transactions underlying the annual
accounts for the year ended 31 December 2013 are legal and regular in all material respects.
The report also makes a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of the Agency, accompanied by the latters
response. The main observations may be summarised as follows:
The Courts observations:

budgetary management: as in 2012, the level of committed appropriations carried over to 2014 remained high for operational
expenses at EUR 10.6 million (46 %), this mainly resulted from the multiannual nature of planned IT development projects (EUR 6.3
million), cost for translations ordered in 2013 but not received by the year end (EUR 1.3 million) and substance evaluations for which
the regulatory deadline was February 2014 (EUR 1.7 million);
financial management: in 2013, the ECHAs Executive Director confirmed reasonable assurance that resources have been used for
their intended purpose and in accordance with the principles of sound financial management, and that the control procedures in place
give the necessary guarantees concerning the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions. However, a reservation to this
assurance was made since the mandate of the Agency does not include controls or inspections at national level and therefore no
confirmation could be given that only registered or authorised substances and products, for which a fee has been paid to the Agency,
were circulating on the European Union market.
The Agencys reply:
budgetary management: ECHA will continue to be attentive to avoid any non-justified carry-over operations;
financial management: the Agency recalled that the Executive Director of the European Chemicals Agency included the following text
in his Declaration of Assurance for 2013: as regards the implementation of the European Union legislation and the fee regulations
under the Agencys remit, this assurance has to be limited to the field of competences of the Agency. Since the mandate of the
European Chemicals Agency does not include controls or inspections at national level, it cannot be confirmed that only registered or
authorised substances and products, for which a fee has been paid to the Agency, are circulating on the European Union market.
Lastly, the Court of Auditors report contains a summary of the Agencys activities in 2013. This is focused on the following:
Budget: EUR 107.7 million.
Activities:
number of dossiers processed: 14 839;
number of confidentiality requests assessment completed: 662;
number of enquiries received: 1 903;
number of decisions issued on data-sharing disputes: 11;
number of substances on which information made public (excluding confidential information): 10 561.
The Agency also:
carried out evaluations for compliance checks;
classified and labelled 6.1 million for over 125 000 substances;
provided advice and assistance, including to institutions and EU bodies;
established scientific IT tools to enable IT solution for Member States for single point of access to dossiers and substance data;
ensured communication operations (including through its website);
ensured international cooperation.

2014/2116(DEC) - 30/07/2014 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: presentation by the Commission of the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2013, as part of
the 2013 discharge procedure.
Analysis of the accounts of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA).
CONTENT: this Commission document sets out the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2013 as
prepared on the basis of the information presented by the institutions, organisations and bodies of the EU, in accordance with Article 129 (2) of
the Financial Regulation applicable to the EU's General Budget, including the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA).
The document contains the figures on which the discharge procedure is based.
Discharge procedure of the EU agencies: the EU Budget finances a wide range of policies and programmes throughout the EU. In accordance
with the priorities set by the European Parliament and the Council in the multi-annual financial framework (MFF), the European Commission
carries out specific programmes, activities and projects in the field with the technical support of some specialised agencies.
The consolidated annual accounts of the EU provide information on the activities of the institutions, agencies and other bodies of the EU from
a budgetary and accrual accounting perspective.
The consolidated reports on the implementation of the general budget of the EU include the budget implementation of all Institutions. Agencies
do not have a separate budget inside the EU budget; and they are partially financed by a Commission budget subsidy.
Each agency is subject to its own discharge procedure.
ECHA: in 2013, the tasks and budget of this agency were as follows:
description of ECHA's tasks: ECHA, located in Helsinki, was set up by Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and
of the Council and its main tasks are to : (i) help businesses comply with the legislation in force; (ii) promote the safe use of chemicals;
(iii) provide information on chemicals; (iv) assess hazardous substances;
ECHA's budget for the 2013 financial year: the Agencys budget for 2013, as presented in the Commission document on the
consolidated annual accounts of the European Union, gives the following figures:
§

Commitment appropriations :
- committed : EUR 108 million;
- paid : EUR 106 million;

- carried-over : 0.
§

Payment appropriations :
- committed : EUR 123 million;
- paid : EUR 106 million;
- carried-over : EUR 14 million.

Please refer also to the final accounts of the ECHA.

2014/2116(DEC) - 30/03/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Ryszard CZARNECKI (ECR, PL) on discharge in respect of the implementation of
the budget of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) for the financial year 2013.
It called on the European Parliament to grant the Executive Director of the Agency discharge in respect of the implementation of the Agencys
budget for the financial year 2013.
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the Agency for the financial
year 2013 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Members called on the Parliament to approve the closure of
the Agencys accounts. They made, however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is
granted, in addition to the general recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of
EU agencies.
Agencys financial statements: Members noted that the final budget of the Agency for the financial year 2013 was EUR 107 270 800. It
received Union subsidies of EUR 7.632 from the Commission and the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance pre-financing
amounting to EUR 103 524, as well as other contributions and funding from the Commission amounting to EUR 920 900.
Commitments and carry-overs: Members noted that budget monitoring efforts during the financial year 2013 resulted in a budget
implementation rate of 98.64% and that the payment appropriations execution rate was 86.18%. They noted with concern that the
level of committed appropriations carried over to 2014 remained high at 46% mainly due to the multiannual nature of planned IT
development projects.
Members also made a series of observations on procurement procedures, recruitment and internal control.
They also noted with concern that the Agencys Executive Director made a reservation regarding his declaration of assurance for the year
2013, since the Agency's mandate does not include controls or inspections at national level and therefore, no confirmation could be given that
only registered or authorised substances and products, for which a fee was paid to the Agency, were circulating on the Union market. Lastly,
they noted the appointment of a small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) ambassador who advocates the interest of smaller enterprises
externally and internally within the Agency. Members noted furthermore that the Agencys priority is to provide intensive support so that SMEs
will be able to comply with the requirements as well as the introduction of the authorisation process as part of the REACH Regulation, in order
to encourage the substitution of the most hazardous chemicals and innovation by swapping them for safer alternatives.

2014/2116(DEC) - 29/04/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 557 votes to 127, with 5 abstentions, a decision to grant discharge to the Executive Director of the
European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) for the financial year 2013.
The vote on the discharge decision approved the closure of the accounts (in accordance with Annex VI, Article 5(1) of the Rules of Procedure
of the European Parliament).
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the Agency for the financial
year 2013 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Parliament adopted by 577 votes to 105, with 7 abstentions,
a resolution containing a number of recommendations that form an integral part of the discharge decision and as well as the general
recommendations that appear in the resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies:
Agencys financial statements: Parliament noted that the final budget of the Agency for the financial year 2013 was EUR 107 270 800.
It received Union subsidies of EUR 7.632 million from the Commission and the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance pre-financing
amounting to EUR 103 524, as well as other contributions and funding from the Commission amounting to EUR 920 900.
Commitments and carry-overs: Parliament noted that budget monitoring efforts during the financial year 2013 resulted in a budget
implementation rate of 98.64% and that the payment appropriations execution rate was 86.18%. It noted with concern that the level of
committed appropriations carried over to 2014 remained high at 46% mainly due to the multiannual nature of planned IT development
projects.
Parliament also made a series of observations on procurement procedures, recruitment and internal control.

2013, since the Agency's mandate does not include controls or inspections at national level and therefore, no confirmation could be given that
only registered or authorised substances and products, for which a fee was paid to the Agency, were circulating on the Union market.
Parliament asked again that the Agency make clear in its internal and external communication that it receives funds from the general budget of
the Union ("Union subsidy") instead of a "Commission" or "Community" subsidy.
Implementation of REACH: Lastly, Parliament stated that the appointment of a small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) ambassador who
advocates the interest of smaller enterprises externally and internally within the Agency. It noted furthermore that the Agencys priority is to
provide intensive support so that SMEs will be able to comply with the requirements as well as the introduction of the authorisation process as

part of the REACH Regulation, in order to encourage the substitution of the most hazardous chemicals and innovation by swapping them for
safer alternatives.
