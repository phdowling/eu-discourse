2014/0093(CNS) - 17/03/2014 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to authorise Spain to apply exemptions from or reductions in the Arbitrio sobre Importaciones y Entregas de Mercancías en las
Islas Canarias (AIEM) to certain products produced locally in the Canary Islands.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to
follow its opinion.
BACKGROUND: Council Decision 2002/546/EC authorised Spain, up to 30 June 2014, to apply exemptions from or reductions in the AIEM to
certain products produced locally in the Canary Islands. The Annex to that Decision contains a list of products to which tax exemptions and
reductions may be applied. The difference between the taxation of locally manufactured products and the taxation of other products may not
exceed 5, 15 or 25 percentage points, depending on the product.
The specific measures covered by Decision 2002/546/EC were designed to strengthen local industry by making it more competitive bearing in
mind taking into account the remoteness, insularity, the predominance of tourism and the small share of industry in the Canary Islands GDP.
Council Decision 895/2011/EU amended Decision 2002/546/EC, extending its period of application up to 31 December 2013.
On 4 March 2013, the Spanish authorities requested the Commission to prepare a Council Decision authorising Spain to apply exemptions
from or reductions in the AIEM to certain products produced locally in the Canary Islands for the period 2014-2020, modifying the list of
products and the maximum rates applicable to some of them.
On 28 June 2013 the Commission adopted new regional aid guidelines for the period 2014-2020. Considering that these Guidelines will enter
into force on 1 July 2014, it seemed justified to extend the period of application of Decision 2002/546/EC, as amended by Decision
895/2011/EU, for six months, so that its expiry date coincides with the expiry date of the current Guidelines.
The analysis of the request received from the Spanish authorities confirms that the special characteristics of the Canary Islands restrain their
development and are responsible for additional costs for the operators situated there. The Commission feels that it is therefore justified to
maintain the exemption of the AIEM to a list of locally produced industrial products.
CONTENT : the draft decision authorises the Spanish authorities, until 31 December 2020, to lay down, in respect of products listed in the
Annex that are produced locally in the Canary
Islands, total exemptions from or partial reductions of the tax known as AIEM. These exemptions must form part of the strategy for economic
and social development of the Canary Islands and contribute to the promotion of local activities. On this basis, the Commission shall present a
full analysis of the economic and social aspects and where appropriate a proposal for adapting the provisions of the Decision.

This derogation will last for six and a half years (from 1 July 2014 to 31 December 2020). Accordingly, the Spanish authorities shall present to
the Commission at the latest by 30 September 2017 a report on the application of these arrangements, in order to check the impact of the
measures taken and their contribution to the promotion or maintenance of local economic activities, account being taken of handicaps affecting
the outermost regions.
On this basis, the scope and the exemptions authorised under Community rules will be revised if necessary.

2014/0093(CNS) - 02/04/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Regional Development adopted, in the framework of a special legislative procedure (Parliament consultation), the report by
Danuta Maria HÜBNER (EPP, PL) on the proposal for a Council decision on the AIEM tax applicable in the Canary Islands.
To recall, Council Decision 2002/546/EC authorises Spain, up to 30 June 2014, to apply exemptions from or reductions in the Arbitrio sobre
Importaciones y Entregas de Mercancías en las Islas Canarias (AIEM) to a number of products produced locally in the Canary Islands, in
order to enhance competiveness and to compensate for the additional costs of production due to isolation, raw material and energy
dependence, the obligation to build up stocks, the small size of the local market and the low level of export activity.
On 4 March 2013, Spain requested the Commission to prepare a Council Decision authorising Spain to apply exemptions from or reductions in
the AIEM to certain products produced locally in the Canary Islands for the period 2014-2020, modifying the list of products and the maximum
rates applicable to some of them.
The Commission found that it is justified to maintain the exemption of the AIEM to a list of locally produced industrial products.
Given that this measure is intended at continuing to stimulate economic activity and competitiveness in an outermost region, without distorting
the legal order of the Union, the committee proposed to that this proposal be adopted without amendment.

2014/0093(CNS) - 16/04/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 591 votes to 64, with 15 abstentions, in the framework of a special legislative procedure (Parliaments
consultation), a legislative resolution on the proposal for a Council decision on the AIEM tax applicable in the Canary Islands.
Following its Committee on Regional Development, Parliament approved the Commission proposal which seeks to authorise the Spanish
authorities to apply, until 31 December 2020, to certain products produced locally in the Canary Islands, exemptions from or reductions to the
AIEM. These reductions should be included in the economic and social development strategy of the Canary Islands and contribute to
promoting local activities.

2014/0093(CNS) - 12/06/2014 Final act
PURPOSE: to authorise Spain to apply exemptions from or reductions in the Arbitrio sobre Importaciones y Entregas de Mercancías en las
Islas Canarias(AIEM) to certain products produced locally in the Canary Islands.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Council Decision No 377/2014/EU on the AIEM tax applicable in the Canary Islands.
CONTENT: the decision authorises Spain, until 31 December 2020, to apply exemptions from or reductions in the Arbitrio sobre las
Importaciones y Entregas de Mercancías en las Islas Canarias (AIEM) to certain products produced locally in the Canary Islands.
The application of the total exemptions or the reductions may not lead to differences between the taxation of locally manufactured products
and the taxation of other products that exceed 5, 15 or 25 percentage points, depending on the product.
These exemptions are intended to help Canary Islands to compensate for the natural handicaps they face, which result in higher production
costs, as well as the limited size of the market. As part of the economic and social development strategy of the Canary Islands, they should
help to maintain, create and develop local production.
The Spanish authorities should present to the Commission by 30 September 2017 at the latest a report on the application of the AIEM tax
exemptions or reductions, in order to check the impact of the measures taken and their contribution to promoting or maintaining local economic
activities, account being taken of the handicaps affecting the outermost regions. On this basis, the scope and the exemptions authorised under
Union rules will be revised, if necessary.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: the decision is applicable from 1 July 2014.
