2014/2120(DEC) - 01/07/2014 Court of Auditors: opinion, report
PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the European Banking Authority (EBA) for the year
2013, together with the EBAs reply.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit concerned, amongst others, the annual accounts of the European Banking Authority (EBA).
Statement of assurance: pursuant to the provisions of Article 287 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the Court
has audited:
the annual accounts of the Authority, which comprise the financial statements and the reports on the implementation of the budget for
the financial year ended 31 December 2013;
the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying those accounts.
Opinion on the reliability of the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the Authoritys annual accounts present fairly, in all material respects, its
financial position as at 31 December 2013 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the
provisions of its Financial Regulation and the accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
Opinion on the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the transactions underlying the annual
accounts for the year ended 31 December 2013 are legal and regular in all material respects.
The report also makes a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of the Authority, accompanied by the latters
response. The main observations may be summarised as follows:
The Courts observations:

budgetary management: the Court noted that in 2013, the overall level of committed appropriations was 90%. Overall, carry-overs of
committed appropriations remained relatively high for administrative expenses at 35% and operational expenses 36%. These
carry-overs mainly result from the planned procurement of IT infrastructure and IT services, for which the contracts were concluded as
planned in December 2013 and the related services will be provided in 2014.
The Authoritys reply:
budgetary management: the EBA acknowledged that, while there has been a significant decrease in the overall level of carry-overs,
there is still room for further improvement. Given that the bulk of the carry-overs arises due to the timing of various annually renewable
IT contracts, the EBA intends within the calendar year to pursue options to amend supplier contracts so as to change renewal periods
and so reduce the level of carry-over.
Lastly, the Court of Auditors report contains a summary of the Authoritys activities in 2013. This is focused on the following:
Budget: EUR 26 million including a European Union subsidy of EUR 10.4 million.
Activities:
submission of draft Regulatory Technical Standards and draft Implementing Technical Standards to the European Commission for
final endorsement;
issuance of guidelines on banking issues and recommendations to national competent authorities;
esablishment of the Single Rulebook Questions and Answers tool on EBA website;
issuance of an extensive number of thematic reports in various areas of EBA expertise;
performance of risk analysis, assessment and monitoring of key risks in the EU banking sector;
execution of the EU-wide transparency exercise providing information on EU banks that were part of the recapitalization exercise in
2012;
preparation for the 2014 stress testing of EU banks (work on development of methodologies, scenarios and key assumptions of the
stress testing).

2014/2120(DEC) - 30/07/2014 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: presentation by the Commission of the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2013, as part of
the 2013 discharge procedure.
Analysis of the accounts of the European Banking Authority (EBA).
CONTENT: this Commission document sets out the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2013 as
prepared on the basis of the information presented by the institutions, organisations and bodies of the EU, in accordance with Article 129 (2) of
the Financial Regulation applicable to the EU's General Budget, including the European Banking Authority (EBA).
The document contains the figures on which the discharge procedure is based.
Discharge procedure of the EU agencies: the EU Budget finances a wide range of policies and programmes throughout the EU. In accordance
with the priorities set by the European Parliament and the Council in the multi-annual financial framework (MFF), the European Commission
carries out specific programmes, activities and projects in the field with the technical support of some specialised agencies.
The consolidated annual accounts of the EU provide information on the activities of the institutions, agencies and other bodies of the EU from
a budgetary and accrual accounting perspective.
The consolidated reports on the implementation of the general budget of the EU include the budget implementation of all Institutions. Agencies
do not have a separate budget inside the EU budget; and they are partially financed by a Commission budget subsidy.
Each agency is subject to its own discharge procedure.
EBA: in 2013, the tasks and budget of this agency were as follows:
description of the EBAs tasks: the Authority, which is located in London, was established by Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the
European Parliament and of the Council and has the aim of protecting the public interest and contributing to the stability and efficiency
of the banking system in the short, medium and long term for the economy of the European Union, its citizens and its businesses;
the EBAs budget for the 2013 financial year: the EBAs budget for 2013, as presented in the Commission document on the
consolidated annual accounts of the European Union, gives the following figures:
§

2014/2120(DEC) - 30/03/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Ryszard CZARNECKI (ECR, PL) on discharge in respect of the implementation of
the budget of the European Banking Authority (EBA) for the financial year 2013.
It called on the European Parliament to grant the Executive Director of the Authority discharge in respect of the implementation of the
Authoritys budget for the financial year 2013.
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the Authority for the financial
year 2013 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Members called on the Parliament to approve the closure of
the Authoritys accounts. They made, however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is
granted, in addition to the general recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of
EU agencies.
Authoritys financial statements: Members noted that the final budget of the Authority for the financial year 2013 was year 2013 was
EUR 25 967 360, representing an increase of 25.16% compared to 2012, due to the Authoritys recently established nature of which
the initial contribution of the Union to the Authoritys budget for 2013 amounted to EUR 10 386 944.
Carry-overs: Members noted that the Authority managed to significantly reduce the overall level of committed appropriations carried
over from EUR 6 547 808 in 2012 (36%) to EUR 3 876 564 in 2013 (17%). They noted with concern that the levels of carry-overs
(36%) were relatively high, mainly due to the planned procurement of IT infrastructure and IT services, and the related services
provided in 2014.
Members also made a series of observations on transfers, the prevention and management of conflicts of interests, recruitment, procurement
procedures and internal control.
Lastly, Members noted that the Authority closely cooperates with the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority and the
European Securities and Markets Authority across all support functions in order to reduce administrative costs where possible, to leverage
synergies and to share best practices. They look forward to further efforts from the Authority to enhance cooperation with other decentralised
agencies.

2014/2120(DEC) - 29/04/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading

Banking Authority (EBA) for the financial year 2013. The vote on the discharge decision approved the closure of the accounts (in accordance
with Annex VI, Article 5(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament).
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the Authority for the financial
year 2013 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Parliament adopted by 561 votes to 107, with 13
abstentions, a resolution containing a number of recommendations that form an integral part of the discharge decision and as well as the
general recommendations that appear in the resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies:

Lastly, Parliament stressed that given its limited resources, the Authority must stick to the tasks assigned to it by Parliament and the Council.
The Authority should carry out those assignments in full but that it must not seek to go beyond its mandate.
