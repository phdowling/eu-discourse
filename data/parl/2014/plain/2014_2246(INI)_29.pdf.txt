Commission response to text adopted in plenary

2014/2246(INI) - 30/09/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Regional Development adopted an own-initiative report by Fernando RUAS (EPP, PT) on cohesion policy and the review of
the Europe 2020 strategy.
Members recalled that cohesion policy is the EUs main investment growth and development policy aligned with the goals of the Europe 2020
strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth and aimed at reducing disparities between regions and promoting convergence, with a
budget of EUR 351.8 billion until the end of 2020. Moreover, preconditions linked directly to these thematic objectives have been established
in order to ensure that investments are made in such a way as to maximise their effectiveness. Members underlined its full support for this new
approach, which will contribute to increasing the effectiveness of spending.
In parallel, underlining the fact that cohesion policy is developing synergies with other EU policies such as the digital single market, the energy
union, the single capital market and social policy, the report called on national and regional authorities across Europe to design smart
specialisation strategies and exploit synergies between different EU, national and regional instruments , both public and private.
Review momentum and related challenges: Members recalled that the Commission launched the strategy review process in 2014 but
considered it regrettable that insufficient reference was made to cohesion policy. They noted that the publication of the Commissions proposal
on the review of the Europe 2020 strategy is due before the end of 2015 and regretted this delay, given that it was initially scheduled for early
2015.
The report called for the scope of the mid-term review of the Europe 2020 strategy to be smart and balanced and to be focused on better
interlinking the strategys five objectives and its flagship initiatives and on identifying methods as to how they could be better carried forward
and evaluated without creating additional layers of complexity and excessive administrative burden.
It stressed the importance of:
taking into account: (i) the strengths and weaknesses of the EU economy, the growing inequalities (such as in wealth), high
unemployment and high public debts; (ii) increased societal and environmental sustainability; (iii) greater social inclusion; (iv) gender
equality; (v) the importance of continued support from the Commission services for Member State authorities in improving
administrative capacity;
enhance the responsibility, ownership, transparency and participation dimensions of the strategy by involving Local and Regional
Authorities (LRAs) and all relevant civil society stakeholders and interested parties from the target-setting and development of
objectives to the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the strategy;
a strengthened governance structure based on multi-level governance. The commitment by LRAs and stakeholders in the Europe
2020 strategy project should be renewed in the form of a pact between those partners, the Member States and the Commission;
the need for a truly territorial approach to the Europe 2020 strategy with a view to adjusting public interventions and investments to
different territorial characteristics and specific needs;
acknowledging the significant role of cities and urban areas as drivers for growth and jobs;
taking into consideration the characteristics and constraints of specific territories, such as those of rural areas, areas affected by
industrial transition, regions suffering from severe and permanent natural or demographic handicaps, island, cross-border and
mountain regions and the EUs outermost regions;
establish a coherent ongoing evaluation process in order to regularly assess the progress of Europe 2020 strategy targets whilst
emphasising Parliaments role to supervise the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy and cohesion policy in a coordinated
manner, not only within Parliament, but also with all relevant institutions.
The report noted the importance of the new EU investment instrument, the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI), which will support
the mobilisation of up to EUR 315 billion in investments.

The EFSI should be complementary and additional to the ESI Funds. Whilst regretting that it is not clearly linked to the Europe 2020 strategy,
Members considered that, through its objectives and the selection of viable, sustainable projects, it should contribute to the implementation of
the strategy in specific areas.
Future cohesion policy: the report stressed that both future cohesion policy and the future EU long-term strategy should be drafted before the
end of the Commissions current term, bearing in mind that there will be elections to the European Parliament in 2019, and that this imposes
significant specific time constraints on the co-legislators as regards the negotiation calendar, and on the new Commission and the Member
States as regards the preparation and adoption of the new partnership agreements and operational programmes before the start of the next
MFF.
The Commission is therefore called upon to take into consideration all the specific constraints and to develop a coherent approach as regards
the EUs future long-term sustainable growth and jobs strategy, the EU budget, cohesion policy in particular, and other instruments under the
MFF.

2014/2246(INI) - 28/10/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 530 votes to 75 with 54 abstentions, a resolution on cohesion policy and the review of the Europe 2020
strategy.
The Europe 2020 strategy and its interrelationship with cohesion policy: Members recalled that cohesion policy is the EUs main investment
growth and development policy aligned with the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth and aimed at
reducing disparities between regions and promoting convergence, with a budget of EUR 351.8 billion until the end of 2020.
Cohesion policy is the EUs main policy aligned with the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy built around five ambitious objectives: employment,
innovation, climate change and energy sustainability, education, and fighting poverty and social exclusion.
Cohesion policy is the main EU instrument, covering all regions, for investment in the real economy. In parallel, it is developing synergies with
other EU policies such as the digital single market, the energy union, the single capital market and social policy. Members called on national
and regional authorities across Europe to design smart specialisation strategies and exploit synergies between different EU, national and
regional instruments, both public and private.
Parliament stresses with concern the delays in implementing cohesion policy during the current programming period. According to the first
evaluation released by the Commission, the amounts allocated to research and innovation, support for SMEs, ICT, the low-carbon economy,
employment, social inclusion, education and capacity-building have increased substantially as compared with the previous programming
periods, while the level of support for transport and environmental infrastructure has decreased.
The resolution drew attention to the fact that, at the time of the mid-term review of the Europe 2020 strategy, data on implementation of the
ESI Funds 2014-2020 may still be lacking, and that, as a result, a concrete evaluation of the contribution of these funds to achieving the
strategys targets may still not be possible at that stage.
Review momentum of Europe 2020 and related challenges: Members recalled that the Commission launched the strategy review process in
2014 but considered it regrettable that insufficient reference was made to cohesion policy. They noted that the publication of the Commissions
proposal on the review of the Europe 2020 strategy is due before the end of 2015 and regretted this delay.
Parliament called for the scope of the mid-term review of the Europe 2020 strategy to be smart and balanced and to be focused on better
