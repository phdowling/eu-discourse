Summary

2014/2954(DEA) - 17/12/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament decided not to raise objections to the Commission delegated regulation of 14 November 2014 amending Annex I to
Council Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 applying the arrangements for products originating in certain states which are part of the African,
Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of States provided for in agreements establishing, or leading to the establishment of, Economic
Partnership Agreements.
Following the conclusion of the negotiations between Kenya, the European Union and its Member States on an Economic Partner Agreement
on 16 October 2014, the Commission adopted a delegated act to reinstate Kenya in Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007. Pursuant to
Regulation (EU) No 527/2013, Kenya ceased as of 1 October 2014 to be covered by the market access arrangement permitted under
Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007.
The Commission stressed that a decision not to raise objections would limit Kenyas potential trade diversion and loss of exports into the EU,
reducing harm to the tuna, horticulture and cut flower sectors. Under these conditions, Parliament declared that it had no objections to
delegated regulation.
