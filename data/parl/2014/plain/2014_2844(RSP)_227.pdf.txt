Summary

The European Parliament adopted a resolution on the situation in Libya.
The resolution was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ECR, ALDE, Greens/EFA, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO (EFD, IT) and Ignazio CORRAO (EFD,
IT).
Noting that recent weeks had seen a severe deterioration in Libyas security situation, political stability, and human rights and humanitarian
situation, Parliament condemned the increasing violence, in particular that against the civilian population and civilian institutions. It noted that
clashes between Misrata and Zintan, rival militias, had intensified and battles for control of Tripoli and Benghazi had destabilised Libyas
democratic transition, with at least 100 000 Libyans internally displaced by the latest wave of fighting and a further 150 000, including many
migrant workers, leaving the country. Parliament called on all parties to the conflict to immediately cease all violence and agree to a ceasefire
in order to end the escalating suffering of the population, and to engage in an inclusive national political dialogue to build a State based on
respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law. It also noted that attacks intentionally directed against personnel involved in
humanitarian assistance or a peacekeeping mission in accordance with the UN Charter, meant for the protection of civilians or civilian objects
under the international law of armed conflict, constituted a war crime under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC).
Sanctions: Whilst recalling that United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Resolution 2174, adopted on 27 August 2014, broadened the existing
international sanctions on Libya, Parliament invited the High Representative, the EU, its Member States and the broader international
community to look into the possibility of applying such measures to specific individuals threatening the prospects for peace and democratic
transition in Libya and then to list them in the same way the international community listed Gaddafi and his inner circle.
State building: Members supported the House of Representatives as the legitimate body emanating from the June 2014 elections. They called
on Libyas interim government, elected House of Representatives and Constitutional Drafting Assembly to carry out their tasks based on the
rule of law and human rights, and called on all parties to engage in an inclusive political dialogue in order to rebuild stability and agree on ways
forward. Parliament invited members of the House of Representatives to visit the European Parliament and meet its newly elected members,
in order to establish parliamentary relations with them. It also called on the Commission and the EEAS to coordinate Member States action in
Libya and focus their support on state-building and institution building and, together with Member States, the UN, NATO and regional partners,
to assist in the creation of effective and nationally commanded and controlled security forces (armed forces and police forces) that could
ensure peace and order in the country, as well as supporting the initialling of a ceasefire and designing a mechanism to monitor it. The EU
should also give priority to assisting with reform of the Libyan justice system, as well as other fields crucial for democratic governance.
EUBAM: Parliament recalled that the Union had launched an EU Border Mission (EUBAM) in Libya, which had so far not been in a position to
achieve its objectives of improving the security of the countrys borders and was currently on hold. It stressed that an EU security-related
contribution focusing only on border security was manifestly insufficient and inconsistent with both the countrys needs and the challenges for
regional security, including that of the EU. Accordingly, the High Representative was asked to review the mandate of the European Union
Border Assistance Mission with a view to designing a new mission within the CSDP which took into account the changed situation in Libya,
especially with regard to the urgent need for state-building, the strengthening of institutions and security sector reform.
Oil: the resolution stressed that the Libyan authorities must administer the exploitation and sale of oil, and called on the international
community to refrain from any transactions with other actors. It asked that international companies involved in Libya reveal their financial
dealings in the energy sector.
Regional players: Members were deeply concerned by reports of involvement of regional players in the violence in Libya and called on
neighbouring countries and regional players to: (i) refrain from actions which might exacerbate current divisions and undermine Libyas
democratic transition; (ii) increase control of their borders, including at seaports and airports, and (iii) maintain thorough inspections of all cargo
to and from Libya. Parliament remained concerned by the proliferation of weapons, ammunition, explosives and smuggling of arms in Libya,
which poses a risk to stability in the country and to its population.
It commended Tunisian hospitality towards the hundreds of thousands of Libyan citizens currently in Tunisia fleeing from violence.
Migration: expressing deep concern by the unprecedented arrival of asylum seekers and irregular migrants on Italian and Maltese shores,
many of whom are departing from Libyan territory, Parliament called on the EU to follow up on the priorities identified in the Mediterranean
Task Force and launch a political dialogue on migration issues with the Libyan government, as soon as conditions allowed. It deeply regretted
that a further 500 lives were lost after their boat was reportedly rammed by another vessel near Malta. Members called on the EU and the
Member States to effectively help and support Italy in its laudable efforts to save lives and to tackle the spiralling migration flows from North
Africa, particularly from Libya.
