Summary

2014/2191(IMM) - 24/03/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Legal Affairs adopted the report by Kostas CHRYSOGONOS (GUE/NGL, EL) in which it recommended the European
Parliament to waive the immunity of António MARINHO E PINTO (ADLE, PT).

The judge at the Coimbra District Court submitted a request for waiver of the parliamentary immunity of a Member of the European Parliament
António Marinho e Pinto in connection with possible legal action concerning an alleged offence.
António Marinho e Pinto is accused of defamation of former officials of the Portuguese Bar Association.
Members considered that the charges are manifestly unrelated to the position of António Marinho e Pinto as a Member of the European
Parliament and arise from his former position as President of the Portuguese Bar Association. Moreover, the alleged actions do not relate to
opinions expressed or votes cast by the Member of the European Parliament in the performance of his duties within the meaning of Article 8 of
Protocol No 7 on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Union.
Lastly, there is no suspicion of any attempt to obstruct the parliamentary work of António Marinho e Pinto ( fumus persecutionis) behind the
proceedings, which were in fact initiated before he assumed his seat in the European Parliament.
Bearing this in mind, the committee recommended that the European Parliament should decide to waive the immunity of António Marinho e
Pinto.
