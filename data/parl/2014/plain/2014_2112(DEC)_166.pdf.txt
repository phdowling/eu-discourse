2014/2112(DEC) - 01/07/2014 Court of Auditors: opinion, report
PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the European Police College (CEPOL) for the year
2013, together with CEPOLs reply.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit concerned, amongst others, the annual accounts of the European Police College (CEPOL).
Statement of assurance: pursuant to the provisions of Article 287 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the Court
has audited:
the annual accounts of the College, which comprise the financial statements and the reports on the implementation of the budget for
the financial year ended 31 December 2013;
the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying those accounts.
Opinion on the reliability of the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the Colleges annual accounts present fairly, in all material respects, its
financial position as at 31 December 2013 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the
provisions of its Financial Regulation and the accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
Opinion on the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the transactions underlying the annual
accounts for the year ended 31 December 2013 are legal and regular in all material respects.
The report also makes a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of CEPOL, accompanied by the latters response.
The main observations may be summarised as follows:
The Courts observations:

budgetary management: out of the committed appropriations carried over from 2012 amounting to EUR 1.7 million, EUR 300 000 were
cancelled in 2013. This was mainly due to lower than estimated costs to be reimbursed under 2012 grant agreements, which indicates
the need to obtain more accurate information from beneficiaries at year-end on the actual cost incurred. The level of committed
appropriations carried over to 2014 was high for administrative expenditure at 30.5%, but this mainly arose from events beyond the
Colleges control, such as payments due in 2014 for services and goods ordered and received as planned in 2013;
recruitment procedures: the Colleges recruitment procedures are still not fully transparent.
CEPOLs reply:
budgetary management: CEPOL has significantly reduced amount of carry-overs. It is committed to further increase and maintain
compliance with the budgetary principle of annuality provided in the Financial Regulation;
recruitment procedures: CEPOL has completed the documentation of the human resources processes by redesigning and improving
the related work instructions, templates and checklists.
The Court of Auditors report contains a summary of CEPOLs activities in 2013. This is focused on the following:
Budget: EUR 8.4 million.
Activities:
implementation of 72 residential activities (courses, seminars and conferences);
CEPOL has brought together highest number of participants in its history: 2 251 law enforcement participants and 707 trainers from 42
countries (EU Member States and Third Countries) and 21 EU and international bodies;
attendance rate has considerably increased reaching the highest ever rate of 116%.
The College itself organised 19 activities in support of the network and initiated a Grant Agreement application process for 2014. In 2013
CEPOL continued its fruitful cooperation with candidate, potential candidate and ENP/EaP countries as well as with Albania and Russia. It
developed training manuals and (common) curricula and held the Annual CEPOL European Police Research and Science Conference with the
title Policing civil societies in times of economic constraints. Lastly, it maintained its European Police Exchange Programme.

2014/2112(DEC) - 30/07/2014 Non-legislative basic document

the Financial Regulation applicable to the EU's General Budget, including the European Police College (CEPOL).
The document contains the figures on which the discharge procedure is based.

annual accounts of the European Union, gives the following figures:

- committed : EUR 9 million;

2014/2112(DEC) - 30/03/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Ryszard CZARNECKI (ECR, PL) on discharge in respect of the implementation of
the budget of the European Police College (CEPOL) for the financial year 2013.
The committee recommended that the European Parliament grant the Director of the of the College discharge in respect of the implementation
of the Colleges budget for the financial year 2013.
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of CEPOL for the financial year
2013 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Members called on the Parliament to approve the closure of
CEPOLs accounts. They made, however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is granted,
in addition to the general recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU
agencies.
CEPOLs financial statements: Members noted that the final budget of CEPOL for the financial year 2013 was EUR 8 450 640, the
whole amount deriving from the EU budget.
Commitments and carry-overs: Members noted that budget monitoring efforts during the financial year 2013 resulted in a budget
implementation rate of 94.89% and that the payment appropriations execution rate was 92.46 %. They pointed out, however, that the
level of committed appropriations carried over to 2014 was high at 30.46 % for administrative expenditure, for reasons outside the
Colleges control (payments due in 2014 for services and goods ordered and received as planned in 2013). They called on the College
to further improve the carry-over levels in order to increase its compliance to the budgetary principle of annuality. Members were
concerned that committed appropriations carried over from 2012 amounting to EUR 1.7 million, and called on the College to inform the
discharge authority on measures taken to address this deficiency as a matter of urgency.
Members also made a series of observations on transfers, procurement and recruitment procedures, and internal audit, and the prevention
and management of conflicts of interests.
The committee noted that the College officially resumed business at its new headquarters in Budapest in October 2014 and supported
the College's efforts that the move to the new seat be carried out in accordance with sound financial management principles. It acknowledged
that the relocation of the College from Bramshill to its new headquarters in Budapest generated yearly savings amounting to EUR 200 000 and
welcomed the fact that the use of the offices in Colleges new headquarters is free of charge for a period of at least ten years.
