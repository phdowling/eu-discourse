2014/0132(COD) - 05/05/2014 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: repealing Council Directive 93/5/EEC of 25 February 1993 on assistance to the Commission and cooperation by the Member
States in the scientific examination of questions relating to food.
PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: with the Regulatory Fitness and Performance Programme (REFIT), the Commission is committed to ensure a simple, clear,
stable and predictable regulatory framework for businesses, workers and citizens.
The aim of Council Directive 93/5/EEC was to ensure the smooth running of the Scientific Committee for Food by promoting the scientific

support from the Member States and by organising the cooperation with the relevant national bodies on scientific issues regarding the safety of
foodstuffs.
Following Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council, the scientific tasks entrusted to the Scientific
Committee on Food have been taken over by the Scientific Committee and Panels of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). EFSA has
also become the competent body to promote scientific cooperation with the Member States and relevant national bodies operating in the fields
falling within the Authority's mission.
CONTENT: Council Directive 93/5/EEC has become obsolete and should be repealed.

2014/0132(COD) - 09/12/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety adopted the report by Giovanni LA VIA (EPP, IT) on the proposal for a
directive of the European Parliament and of the Council repealing Council Directive 93/5/EEC of 25 February 1993 on assistance to the
Commission and cooperation by the Member States in the scientific examination of questions relating to food.
It recommended the European Parliament to adopt its position at first reading taking over the Commission proposal.

2014/0132(COD) - 16/12/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 640 votes to 53, with 6 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a directive of the
European Parliament and of the Council repealing Council Directive 93/5/EEC of 25 February 1993 on assistance to the Commission and
cooperation by the Member States in the scientific examination of questions relating to food.
Parliament adopted its position at first reading without making amendments to the Commission proposal.
In December 2012, the Commission launched the Regulatory Fitness and Performance Programme (REFIT) to ensure a simple, clear, stable
and predictable regulatory framework for businesses, workers and citizens. In this context, the Commission has proposed to repeal Council
Directive 93/5/EEC.
The aim of Council Directive 93/5/EEC was to ensure the smooth running of the Scientific Committee for Food by promoting the scientific
support from the Member States and by organising the cooperation with the relevant national bodies on scientific issues regarding the safety of
foodstuffs.

2014/0132(COD) - 11/02/2015 Final act
PURPOSE: repealing Council Directive 93/5/EEC of 25 February 1993 on assistance to the Commission and cooperation by the Member
States in the scientific examination of questions relating to food.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Directive (EU) 2015/254 of the European Parliament and of the Council repealing Council Directive 93/5/EEC on
assistance to the Commission and cooperation by the Member States in the scientific examination of questions relating to food.
CONTENT: this Directive repeals Directive 93/5/EEC.
Council Directive 93/5/EEC aimed to ensure the smooth running of the Scientific Committee on Food by promoting the scientific support from
the Member States to that Committee and by organising cooperation with the relevant national bodies on scientific issues regarding the safety
of foodstuffs.
Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council, the tasks of the Scientific Committee on Food
referred to in Directive 93/5/EEC have been transferred to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), and those tasks are currently provided
for by Regulation (EC) No 178/2002.
EFSA has also become the competent body to promote scientific cooperation with the Member States and relevant national bodies operating
in the fields falling within EFSA's mission.
In the framework of the Regulatory Fitness and Performance Programme (REFIT), the Commission is committed to achieving a simple, clear,
stable and predictable regulatory framework for businesses, workers and citizens.
Directive 93/5/EEC has therefore become obsolete and should be repealed
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 10.03.2015.
TRANSPOSITION: 29.2.2016 at the latest.
