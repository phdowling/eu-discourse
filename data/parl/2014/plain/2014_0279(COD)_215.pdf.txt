2014/0279(COD) - 19/09/2014 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to extend the application of Regulation (EU) No 374/2014 on the reduction or elimination of customs duties on goods originating in
Ukraine.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the Council and the European Parliament.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: Ukraine is a priority partner country within the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) and the Eastern Partnership. The
European Union and Ukraine negotiated in 2007-2011 an Association Agreement, including a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area
(DCFTA), which was signed by both parties on 27 June 2014. The European Union and Ukraine are to establish a free trade area over a
transitional period of a maximum of 10 years starting from the entry into force of the Association Agreement.
Regulation (EU) No 374/2014 on the reduction or elimination of customs duties on goods originating in Ukraine was to apply until Title IV of the
Association Agreement enters into force or is applied provisionally. It was intended that this Regulation (would cease to apply on 1 November
2014 at the latest.
In light of the unprecedented security, political and economic challenges faced by Ukraine, and in order to support its economy, it was decided
to anticipate the implementation of the Schedule of concessions set out in Annex I-A to the Association Agreement between the EU and
Ukraine by means of the autonomous trade preferences provided for under Regulation (EU) No 374/2014. In view of the challenges Ukraine
still faces, the application of Regulation (EU) No 374/2014 shall be extended.
CONTENT: in order to support the political and economic stability of Ukraine, the European Commission would propose the extension of the
application of Regulation (EU) No 374/2014 on the reduction or elimination of customs duties on goods originating in Ukraine until 31
December 2015. For the purpose of predictability, the customs duties and access to tariff quotas should following the extension remain the
same as for 2014.
The autonomous trade preferences provided for by Regulation (EU) No 374/2014 should have full respect for democratic principles, human
rights and fundamental freedoms and respect for the principle of the rule of law, promotion of respect for the principles of sovereignty and
territorial integrity, inviolability of borders and independence, as well as countering the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
The proposal ensures that it is appropriate to introduce the possibility to temporarily suspend the preferences in case of failure to respect the

fundamental principles of human rights, democracy and the rule of law by Ukraine.
BUDGETARYIMPLICATION: the European Union will see a loss of customs revenue corresponding to EUR 487 million (gross) annually.
However, those figures are estimates, having regard to the political and economic situation of Ukraine and can change.

2014/0279(COD) - 20/10/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on International Trade adopted the report by Gabrielius LANDSBERGIS (EPP, LT) on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) No 374/2014 on the reduction or elimination of customs duties on goods
originating in Ukraine.
The committee recommended the European Parliament to adopt its position at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure taking
over the Commission proposal.
Members supported the Commission proposal seeking to extend the application of Regulation (EU) No 374/2014 on the reduction or
elimination of customs duties on goods originating in Ukraine until 31 December 2015 .
The extension of the Regulation (EU) No 374/2014 until the end of 2015 is intended to support Ukraine in its extremely difficult security,
political and economic situation through the implementation of EU tariff commitments under the ratified Association Agreement.
Given the objective to ensure the maintenance of the existing conditions for the access to the EU market and minimise the risks of disruption
on exports to the EU, Members considered that the most effective solution remains the extension of the autonomous trade measures.

2014/0279(COD) - 23/10/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 497 votes to 78, with 56 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation of the

originating in Ukraine.

Parliament supported the Commission proposal seeking to extend the application of Regulation (EU) No 374/2014 on the reduction or
elimination of customs duties on goods originating in Ukraine until 31 December 2015 .

principles of human rights, democracy and the rule of law by Ukraine.

2014/0279(COD) - 29/10/2014 Final act
PURPOSE: to extend the application of Regulation (EU) No 374/2014 on the reduction or elimination of customs duties on goods originating in
Ukraine.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Regulation (EU) No 1150/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) No 374/2014
on the reduction or elimination of customs duties on goods originating in Ukraine.
CONTENT: in order to support the political and economic stability of Ukraine, the European Commission would propose the extension of the
application of Regulation (EU) No 374/2014 on the reduction or elimination of customs duties on goods originating in Ukraine until 31
December 2015. For the purpose of predictability, the customs duties and access to tariff quotas should following the extension remain the
same as for 2014.
Ukraine is a priority partner country within the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) and the Eastern Partnership. The European Union and
Ukraine negotiated an Association Agreement, including a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA), which was signed by both
parties on 27 June 2014. Under the provisions of the DCFTA, the Union and Ukraine are to establish a free trade area over a transitional
period of a maximum of 10 years, starting from the entry into force of the Association Agreement, in accordance with Article XXIV of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994.
In light of the unprecedented security, political and economic challenges faced by Ukraine, and in order to support its economy, it was decided
to anticipate the implementation of the Schedule of concessions set out in Annex I-A to the Association Agreement by means of the
autonomous trade preferences provided for under Regulation (EU) No 374/2014.
The autonomous preferences provided for under Regulation (EU) No 374/2014 should also be subject to the respect for democratic principles,
human rights and fundamental freedoms, and respect for the principle of the rule of law constitute essential elements of that Agreement.
Furthermore, it provides that the promotion of respect for the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, inviolability of borders and
independence, as well as countering the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
It is for this reason that the amending Regulation provides the possibility to temporarily suspend the preferences in case of failure to respect
the fundamental principles of human rights, democracy and the rule of law by Ukraine.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 31.10.2014. The Regulation shall apply from 2.11.2014.
