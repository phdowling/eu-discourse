2014/2115(DEC) - 01/07/2014 Court of Auditors: opinion, report
PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA) for the
year 2013, together with the Agencys reply.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit concerned, amongst others, the annual accounts of the European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA).
Statement of assurance: pursuant to the provisions of Article 287 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the Court
has audited:
the annual accounts of the Agency, which comprise the financial statements (3) and the reports on the implementation of the budget
(4) for the financial year ended 31 December 2013;
the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying those accounts.
Opinion on the reliability of the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the Agencys annual accounts present fairly, in all material respects, its
financial position as at 31 December 2013 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the
provisions of its Financial Regulation and the accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
Opinion on the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the transactions underlying the annual
accounts for the year ended 31 December 2013 are legal and regular in all material respects.
The report also makes a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of the Agency, accompanied by the latters
response. The main observations may be summarised as follows:
The Courts observations:

budgetary management: in 2013, the level of committed appropriations carried over to 2014 however was high at 38% for
administrative expenditure and 43% for operating expenditure. An important reason for the high level of planned carry-overs was the
considerable workload faced by the agency as a result of the large number of IT projects that were either launched or ongoing during
2013.
The Agencys reply:
budgetary management: the Agency agrees with the facts presented by the Court.
Lastly, the Court of Auditors report contains a summary of the Agencys activities in 2013. This is focused on the following:
Budget: EUR 9.22 million.
Activities:
implementation of JDP (Joint Deployment Plan) cod fishery in the North Sea, Skagerrak, Kattegat and the Eastern Channel and
Western Waters (West of Scotland and the Irish Sea) and other fishery programmes (cod and salmon fisheries in the Baltic Sea,
bluefin tuna fishery in the Mediterranean Sea and Eastern Atlantic, support to national control programmes in the Black Sea);
capacity building as regards training;
operation, maintenance, enhancement and development of ICT monitoring capabilities: Vessel Monitoring System (VMS), Electronic
Reporting System (ERS), Electronic Inspection Report (EIR), Coordination of inspections (JADE), portal and operational conferencing
(Fishnet);
support activities to fight Illegal unreported and unregulated fisheries;
provision of contractual services to charter an EFCA Fisheries Patrol Vessel;
advanced training for Union inspectors.

2014/2115(DEC) - 30/03/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading

The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Ryszard CZARNECKI (ECR, PL) on discharge in respect of the implementation of
the budget of the European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA) for the financial year 2013.
It called on the European Parliament to grant the Executive Director of the Agency discharge in respect of the implementation of the Agencys
budget for the financial year 2013.
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the Agency for the financial
year 2013 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Members called on the Parliament to approve the closure of
the Agencys accounts. They made, however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is
granted, in addition to the general recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of
EU agencies.
Agencys financial statements: Members noted that the final budget of the Agency for the financial year 2013 was EUR 9.216.900,
deriving entirely from the Union budget.
Commitments and carry-overs: Members noted that budget monitoring efforts during the financial year 2013 resulted in a budget
implementation rate of 98.64 % and that the payment appropriations execution rate was 83.85%. They observed, however, that for
operational expenditure, the level of committed appropriations carried over was high, resulting mainly from the large number of IT
projects that were either launched or ongoing during 2013.
Members also made a series of observations on procurement procedures, recruitment, the prevention and management of conflicts of
interests and internal controls.
They noted that the Agencys obligation to publish declarations of interests did not apply to the members of its Advisory Board. They called on
the Agency to publish the CVs of the Executive Director, Heads of Units and members of the Administrative Board and declarations of
interests of members of the Advisory Board in order to contribute to transparency.

2014/2115(DEC) - 29/04/2015 Final act
PURPOSE: to grant discharge to the European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA) for the financial year 2013.
NON LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision (EU) 2015/1655 of the European Parliament on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of
the European Fisheries Control Agency for the financial year 2013.
CONTENT: with the present decision, the European Parliament grants discharge to the Executive Director of the European Fisheries Control
Agency for the implementation of its budget for the financial year 2013.
This decision is in line with the European Parliament's resolution adopted on 29 April 2015 and comprises a series of observations that form
an integral part of the discharge decision (please refer to the summary of the opinion of 29 April 2015).
Amongst Parliaments main observations, it called on the EFCA to revise its policy on declarations of interests and publish the CVs of its
personnel on a mandatory basis in order to contribute to more transparency.

2014/2115(DEC) - 29/04/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading

year 2013 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Parliament adopted by 581 votes to 107, with 6 abstentions,
