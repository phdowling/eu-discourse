Summary

The European Parliament adopted by 564 votes to 28 with 35 abstentions a resolution on Nigeria recent attacks by Boko Haram.
The resolution was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ECR, ALDE, GUE/NGL, and Greens/ALE groups. Parliament referred to the kidnapping of 276
female students by Boko Haram from the Government Secondary School in Chibok on 15 April 2014, and the kidnappings that had taken
place since then, as well as the fact that the violence instigated by this Islamist jihadi extremist organisation had caused many thousands of
deaths in the past ten years.
Members expressed great concern about Boko Harams active targeting of women and children as part of its bloody guerrilla campaign and
condemned the flagrant violation of fundamental rights constituted by the fact that Boko Haram was prohibiting young girls and boys from
having access to education. They called on the Nigerian Government and authorities to work together to ensure that the girls were brought
home safely, to improve transparency about the rescue efforts and to provide adequate information and medical and psychological support to
families of abducted girls in order to end the climate of suspicion. They noted alarming reports, including from the EEAS and government
sources, about indiscriminate violence as part of the government response.
In this context, Parliament urged the EEAS, the Council and the Commission to:
·

work with the UN and other international partners to cut off funding for, and restrict the movements of, Boko Haram and, in particular,
its leadership;

·

continue to cooperate with Nigeria, including on the case of the Chibok schoolgirls, bilaterally and through regional and UN
structures, in relief efforts, training of security forces and intelligence sharing;

·

swiftly to conclude the 2014-2020 country strategy for Nigeria and to include aid and assistance aimed at removing the root causes
of the rise of Boko Haram.

The Nigerian government is also called upon to fight the root causes of the Boko Haram insurgency, including underdevelopment, widespread
corruption, embezzlement of oil money, radicalisation and a lack of prospects, and furthermore, to bridge the economic divide between the
north and south of the country, including by providing better education and health-care services in the north, and to ensure a fair distribution of
benefits from oil wealth through the state budget to ensure proper regional development.
Lastly, Parliament took the view that the Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism on grave violations of childrens rights in situations of armed
conflict should be activated in Nigeria and that UNICEF should increase its capacity in this area, in line with its mandate.
