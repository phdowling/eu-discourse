Summary

2014/2158(INI) - 06/05/2014 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: presentation of the Commission Report on Competition Policy 2013.
CONTENT: in its 2013, the Commission stressed that there have been encouraging signs that an economic recovery is underway in Europe.
Moreover, the European Parliaments 2013 study on competition policy concluded: Competition plays a crucial role in promoting productivity
and innovation as drivers of economic growth. This means that competition policy, which intensifies competition, will stimulate growth.
In 2013, all competition-enforcement instruments have contributed to promote growth and competitiveness across the European economy.
Promoting competitiveness by fighting against cartels: antitrust enforcement has deterred and punished the artificial fragmentation of the
internal market.
Cartels often concern input and intermediate goods and the Commission has focused its enforcement efforts on this area.
The Commission is currently dealing with a number of cases in the area of financial services. On 4 December, the Commission fined 8 banks a
total of EUR 1 712 468 000 for participating in cartels in markets for financial derivatives covering the EEA.
The Commission also has several ongoing cases in the food sector, an area of direct concern to consumers.
In addition to those decisions, in April the Commission sent a Statement of Objections to a number of suppliers of smart-card chips for their
alleged participation in a cartel.
The Commission adopted an additional key initiative for the antitrust regulatory environment: the proposal for a Directive on how citizens and
companies can claim damages when they are victims of infringements of the EU antitrust rules, such as cartels and abuses of a dominant

market position.
Furthermore, the Commission adopted a series of measures aiming to simplify mergers.
State Aid Modernisation: State aid Modernisation has been developed to encourage the design of growth-enhancing public spending. In 2013,
the main elements on which the Commission focused its work on were as follows:
adoption of new Regional Aid guidelines for 2014-2020;
revised guidelines for the application of EU State aid rules to the broadband sector;
revised State Aid guidelines devoted to the promotion of risk-capital investments in SMEs;
new State Aid guidelines on rescue and restructuring to support firms in temporary difficulties;
revised State aid guidelines for research, development and innovation (R&D&I), with a view to adopting new rules in 2014;
revised future State aid guidelines for energy and environment which should lead to the adoption of new rules in 2014.
Strategic sectors: important decisions have been taken in sectors of strategic importance such as financial services, telecoms, the digital
economy, and energy.
In the financial sector: most of the efforts focused on: (i) focus on derivatives and benchmark rates, with a proposed draft Regulation
to restore confidence in those benchmarks to ensure the integrity of benchmarks by guaranteeing that they are not subject to conflicts
of interest; (ii) state aid in the banking sector, revamped based on the Banking Communication; (iii) the enforcement and regulatory
efforts in the payments area, with the revised Payment Services Directive and the Proposal for a Regulation on interchange fees for
card-based payments.
In the energy sector: the measures to be taken aim to provide the EU with a common framework for energy, investing in infrastructure,
increasing energy efficiency, and encouraging more efficient and better market-integrated aid to renewables. Competition is part of the
policy mix that can address those challenges. In 2013, antitrust enforcement actions have contributed or will contribute in the future to
curbing energy prices by combatting abusive or collusive behaviour leading to segmentation of markets and inefficient allocation of
energy.
In the digital sector: effective scrutiny of the behaviour of dominant firms, as well as quick reaction in case of abuses, is particularly
important, since illegal practices may cause the early exit from the market of small and innovative competitors. The Commission
sought to: (i) facilitate the dissemination of intellectual property and knowledge is also important in the digital industries; (ii) combine
competition-policy instruments to address the challenges of fast-moving market; (iii) promote connectivity and tackling Single Market
fragmentation in the telecoms sector; (iv) remove obstacles to innovation in the knowledge economy.
International cooperation: international co-operation in competition policy-making and enforcement helped to tackle the challenges posed by
the growing internationalisation of business. As encouraged by the European Parliament, the Commission continued to engage in multilateral
and bilateral policy dialogues with the authorities in a number of other jurisdictions so as to promote convergence on both substantive and
procedural competition rules.

2014/2158(INI) - 04/02/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs adopted the own-initiative report by Morten MESSERSCHMIDT (ECR, DK) on the Annual
Report on EU Competition Policy.
The report stressed the fact that competition policy plays a key role in reinforcing the holistic approach to the single market aimed at to
addressing Europes economic, social and environmental challenges. It highlighted the essential role of competition policy enforcement in
creating a level playing field that fosters innovation, productivity, job creation and investment by all players across the single market and
across all business models, including SMEs. The Commission is called upon to:
·

consider the social and labour impacts of its interventions in the field of state aid, especially in those regions with high levels of
unemployment;

·

identify possible imbalances between Member States which could distort competition, as well as their causes and economic impact;

·

respect the needs of citizens, consumers and SMEs by placing their concerns at the centre of the decision-making process;

·

significantly widen and deepen its investigations into fiscal state aid, in light of the LuxLeaks revelations.

State aid and Services of General Economic Interest (SGEIs): the report reaffirmed the importance of the SGEI designation for universally
accessible services that are of vital significance to European citizens, from healthcare to social security to housing provision. However, the
Commission should ensure that compensation granted to SGEIs is compatible with EU state aid rules.
Antitrust and cartels: in order to increase the effectiveness of the penalty system, the Commission is called upon to:
·

assess the possibility of complementing cartel fines with individual sanctions such as individual fines and disqualification of directors;

·

put in place an institutional mechanism which would ensure that whenever a national authority takes an antitrust decision there
would be an automatic follow-up check;

·

provide a comprehensive legal and economic assessment of antitrust and cartels cases, particularly in fast-moving markets.

They called, in that connection, for details to be provided of the conditions subject to which parent companies that exercise a degree of
influence over their subsidiaries can be held severally liable for breaches of antitrust law by the latter even if they themselves were not directly
involved.
Merger control: the Commission is called upon to be attentive to those cases where just after a merger is cleared, consumer prices rise or
there is a relevant reduction of a products quality. The report also called for much clearer definitions to be drawn up of the concepts of market
share, market power and definition.
Sector developments: the report:

·

stressed that competition policy should take account of the threefold objective of the affordability, sustainability and security of
energy supply for the European economy and its competitiveness when addressing the current fragmentation of the market;

·

recognised the role of competition policy in the pursuit of a Digital Single Market and called on the Commission to review existing
competition law instruments in order to determine whether they meet the demands of the digital age;

·

called on the Commission to analyse how to accommodate the rise of the sharing economy in the European legislation;

·

invited the Member States to implement the new EU public procurement rules and the Commission to ensure their application;

·

highlighted the contribution of cartel enforcement to a more transparent financial services sector; it called for a swift end to the state
aid crisis regime for the banking sector;

·

stressed the importance of conducting a thorough analysis of each Member States tax laws with a view to putting forward tax
harmonisation measures which support SMEs and foster their growth and which ensure that Member States are competitive on
world market;

·

called on the Commission and the Member States to ensure a level playing field which allows free but also fair competition in all
transport modes; the Commission is invited to complete the implementation of the Single European Railway Area.

International dimension: the report called for the inclusion of a competition chapter, to include provisions covering antitrust, mergers,
state-owned enterprises, subsidies and unequal market access, within the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership agreement.
Role of the European Parliament: Members considered that the fundamentals and key guidelines of competition policy should in future be
drawn up and adopted in closer cooperation with Parliament in order to strengthen the democratic legitimation of the competition authority.
Members called on the Commissioner to commit to frequent meetings with the relevant committees of Parliament, as well as with the
Competition Working Group of Parliaments Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
Lastly, they considered that the European Parliament should have codecision powers in competition policy.

2014/2158(INI) - 10/03/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 526 votes to 108, with 59 abstentions, a resolution on the Annual Report on EU Competition Policy.
Parliament stressed the need to focus more on promoting competition for the achievement of the ambitious objectives for jobs, growth,
investment and the global competitiveness of the European economy. It highlighted the essential role of competition policy enforcement in
creating a level playing field that fosters innovation, productivity, job creation and investment by all players across the single market and
across all business models, including SMEs. The Commission is called upon to:
·

enforce antitrust, state aid and merger control rules with a view to achieving a well-functioning internal market and social progress;

·

consider the social and labour impacts of its interventions in the field of state aid, especially in those regions with high levels of
unemployment;

·

respect the needs of citizens, consumers and SMEs by placing their concerns at the centre of the decision-making process;

·

state clearly its concerns in the sphere of taxation and ensure that competition policy instruments must not be misused as a means
of implementing tax measures.

State aid and Services of General Economic Interest (SGEIs): Parliament reaffirmed the importance of the SGEI designation for universally
accessible services that are of vital significance to European citizens, from healthcare to social security to housing provision. However, the
Commission should ensure that compensation granted to SGEIs is compatible with EU state aid rules.
Members reiterated that EU Structural Funds may not be used in a way that directly or indirectly supports the relocation of services or
production to other Member States.
Antitrust and cartels: each year losses of EUR 181-320 billion approximately 3% of EU GDP accrue owing to the existence of cartels. In order
to increase the effectiveness of the penalty system, the Commission is called upon to:
·

assess the possibility of complementing cartel fines with individual sanctions such as individual fines and disqualification of directors;

·

put in place an institutional mechanism which would ensure that whenever a national authority takes an antitrust decision there
would be an automatic follow-up check;

·

provide a comprehensive legal and economic assessment of antitrust and cartels cases, particularly in fast-moving markets.

Merger control: the Commission is called upon to be attentive to those cases where just after a merger is cleared, consumer prices rise or
there is a relevant reduction of a products quality. The report also called for much clearer definitions to be drawn up of the concepts of market
share, market power and definition.
Sector developments: Parliament made the following recommendations:
·

as regards energy and environment, competition policy should take account of the threefold objective of the affordability,
sustainability and security of energy supply for the European economy and its competitiveness when addressing the current
fragmentation of the market;

·

review existing competition law instruments in order to determine whether they meet the demands of the digital age; enforce properly
both ex post and ex ante competition rules in order to prevent excessive market concentration and abuse of dominance;

·

analyse how to accommodate the rise of the sharing economy in the European legislation; companies related to the so-called
sharing economy must pay taxes and comply with regulations in the same way as traditional businesses;

·

implement the new EU public procurement rules in a timely manner, including the provisions on criteria linked to the subject-matter
of the contract, including social, environmental and innovative characteristics, and on e-administration, e-procurement;

·

maintain a close watch on the banking sector in order to enhance competition in European banking markets; return to the
conventional application of state aid control as soon as this is viable for the banking sector;

·

strengthen the links between competition policy and transport policy in order to improve the competitiveness of the European
transport sector and complete the implementation of the Single European Railway Area.

On fiscal state aid, Parliament is concerned over possible illegal corporate tax practices in Member States. It called on the Commission to
conclude its ongoing investigations into tax rulings as speedily as possible using all available evidence, notably in light of the publication of the
LuxLeaks documents.
International dimension: the resolution called for the inclusion of a competition chapter, to include provisions covering antitrust, mergers,
state-owned enterprises, subsidies and unequal market access, within the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership agreement.
Role of the European Parliament: the resolution considered that the fundamentals and key guidelines of competition policy should in future be
drawn up and adopted in closer cooperation with Parliament in order to strengthen the democratic legitimation of the competition authority.
Members called on the Commissioner to commit to frequent meetings with the relevant committees of Parliament, as well as with the
Competition Working Group of Parliaments Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
Lastly, they considered that the European Parliament should have codecision powers in competition policy.
