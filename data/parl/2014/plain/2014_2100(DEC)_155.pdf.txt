The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Ryszard CZARNECKI (ECR, PL) on discharge in respect of the implementation of
the budget of the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA) for the financial year 2013.
It called on the European Parliament to grant the Director of the Agency discharge in respect of the implementation of the Institutes budget for

the financial year 2013.
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the Agency for the financial
year 2013 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Members called on the Parliament to approve the closure of
the Agencys accounts. They made, however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is
granted, in addition to the general recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of
EU agencies.
Agencys financial statements: Members noted that the final budget of the Agency for the financial year 2013 was EUR 17 682 338,
representing an increase of 4.5 % compared to 2012. The Union's contribution to the Agency's budget amounted to EUR 15 614 775.
Carry-overs: Members noted that budget monitoring efforts during the financial year 2013 resulted in a budget implementation rate of
98.94 %, and that the payment appropriations execution rate was 70.19 %. They also remarked that the level of committed
appropriations carried over was high for administrative and operational expenditure, due to the planned year-end purchase of goods
and services related to the Agencys move into its new premises.
The committee also made a series of observations on transfers, the prevention and management of conflicts of interests, recruitment,
procurement procedures and internal control.
In general, Members requested that the Agency adopt comprehensive policies for the management of conflicts of interests situations such as
divesting the public official's interests, the recusal of the public official from involvement in an affected decision-making process, the restriction
of access by the affected public official to particular information, the rearrangement of the public official's duties or the resignation of the public
official from their office.
