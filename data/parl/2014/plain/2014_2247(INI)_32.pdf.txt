2014/2247(INI) - 30/10/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Regional Development adopted an own-initiative report by Terry REINTKE (Greens/EFA, DE) on cohesion policy and
marginalised communities.
The report underlined the important role of cohesion policy in supporting the economic, social and territorial inclusion of marginalised
communities.
Members recalled that marginalised communities were introduced as a focus of cohesion policy measures because of the growing concern
about, and commitment to combat, social exclusion, including concern about the situation of Roma and the longstanding demand to improve
their living conditions.
The Commission is called upon to:
issue guidance on the definition of marginalised communities, specifying a set of attributes and characteristics of marginalised groups,
taking into account the specific situation, challenges and needs of each potential target group with the aim of promoting their
socio-economic inclusion, and involving representatives of those communities;
provide detailed information about the take-up of funding opportunities for marginalised communities.
The implementation of the cohesion policy must tackle the crucial challenge of poverty and exclusion of young people and children, adults and
people with disabilities.
Furthermore, stressing the importance of access to public service, the report called on the Member States:
to improve the provision of tailored health-information material and the development of disease-prevention strategies and
community-health initiatives in marginalised communities;
to create specialised structures, such as clearing points advising on issues related to access to healthcare, labour market and
education;
to put in place measures to effect a shift in public administrations from a demand-driven approach to a welcoming service approach.
Preparation of programmes: Members regretted that the Commission has accepted partnership agreements that do not include marginalised
communities to a sufficient degree. It asked the Commission to take measures to facilitate the inclusion of marginalised communities in the
preparation, implementation and assessment of projects, as a tool for empowering the concerned communities. They suggested that
recommendations be presented in the context of the European Semester as a suitable way of promoting action to be taken by Member States.

The report stressed the importance of implementing the code of conduct on partnership in ensuring equal participation and representation of
partners, whereby specific attention should be paid to including marginalised communities so that their specific situation, and any potential
challenges that they face in contributing substantially to the partnership, may be taken into account.
Implementation of programmes: Members are of the opinion that funds should be used in a more integrated way, including by means of
multi-fund programmes, Community-Led Local Development, Integrated Territorial Investment and cross-financing, and that synergies should
be achieved with other EU and national funding instruments.
The report emphasised the importance of a genuine implementation of urban renewal and regeneration programmes for deprived
neighbourhoods. They drew attention to the specific needs that marginalised communities living in rural, mountainous and isolated areas face,
as well as those living in cross-border areas.
The Commission is called upon to offer the technical support needed to improve the administrative capacity of bodies involved in the
administration of the Structural Funds and to set up an ad hoc expert group for advice, and promote appropriate training for administrative
staff, in order to provide specific knowledge of the difficulties facing marginalised communities. Members considered it essential to include
equality bodies, women's organisations and women from marginalised communities in the decision-making process on the allocation, use,
implementation and monitoring of the funds, at all levels.
Monitoring and recommendations: EU-funded projects must have a long-term perspective in order to be effective. Members called on the
Commission to put in place proactive and participatory mechanisms for monitoring and observing Members States' actions in the planning and
evaluation processes for funds used for marginalised communities.
The report stressed the importance of integrated housing, educational and employment interventions, in favour of marginalised communities.
More specifically, it called on the need:
to make special efforts as regards existing EU programmes, such as the Youth Employment Initiative, Erasmus+ and Creative Europe,
with a view of reaching out to members of marginalised communities;
for the funds to be used to improve living conditions and to facilitate access for women in marginalised communities to high-quality,
stable education, housing, health care, employment, childcare, social services;
to rigorously enforce and monitor EU legislation on discrimination and to carry out a thorough analysis of the causes of discrimination
and marginalisation, and to raise awareness of the fact that xenophobia and racism and all types of marginalisation leading to
systemic exclusion, must be eliminated;
to implement programmes, projects and support activities for marginalised communities in order to provide for preschool education, to
underpin the need for formal education;
to propose accessible and affordable training and services for all in the field of new technologies and sectors, with special regard to
opportunities in the digital sector and the green economy, especially for the most disadvantaged groups.
The Commission is called upon to provide coherent, consistent and clear guidance on the development, implementation and management of
the EU-funded projects related to marginalised communities, including in-depth analyses, best practise examples and policy
recommendations, to ensure that marginalised communities are included in EU funds also in view of the forthcoming programming period.

2014/2247(INI) - 24/11/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 574 votes to 84, with 36 abstentions, a resolution on cohesion policy and marginalised communities.
Members recalled that cohesion policy is aimed at enhancing economic, social and territorial cohesion, reducing social disparities, including
the reduction and eradication of poverty and exclusion, which calls for the prevention of segregation and for the promotion of equal access and
opportunities for all citizens, including the most marginalised communities as well as groups and individuals of all ages facing poverty and
social exclusion and lacking access to education, employment, housing and healthcare systems.
General principles: Members recalled the urgent need to tackle the issue of marginalised communities as well as underlined the important role
of cohesion policy in supporting their economic, social and territorial inclusion. They highlighted that the implementation of the cohesion policy
must tackle the crucial challenge of poverty and exclusion of young people and children, adults and people with disabilities.
The Commission is called upon to:
issue guidance on the definition of marginalised communities, specifying a set of attributes and characteristics of marginalised groups,
taking into account the specific situation, challenges and needs of each potential target group with the aim of promoting their
socio-economic inclusion, and involving representatives of those communities;
provide detailed information about the take-up of funding opportunities for marginalised communities.
Furthermore, stressing the importance of access to public service, the resolution called on the Member States:
to create specialised structures, such as clearing points advising on issues related to access to healthcare, labour market and
education;
to put in place measures to effect a shift in public administrations from a demand-driven approach to a welcoming service approach.
Members also called for: (i) local authorities to encourage the use of ESF funding to support informal learning and lifelong learning projects; (ii)
better coordination and stronger links between national strategies for marginalised communities, including National Roma Inclusion Strategies;
(iii) children to be made a priority when implementing the EU Framework for National Roma Strategies.
Preparation of programmes: Parliament asked the Commission to take measures to facilitate the inclusion of marginalised communities in the
preparation, implementation and assessment of projects, as a tool for empowering the concerned communities. It suggested that
recommendations be presented in the context of the European Semester and called on the Member States to act on, and on the Commission
to follow up closely, the country-specific recommendations issued on the social inclusion of marginalised communities.
The resolution stressed the importance of implementing the code of conduct on partnership in ensuring equal participation and representation
of partners, whereby specific attention should be paid to including marginalised communities so that their specific situation, and any potential

challenges that they face in contributing substantially to the partnership, may be taken into account.
Implementation of programmes: Members are of the opinion that funds should be used in a more integrated way, including by means of
multi-fund programmes, in order to achieve synergies with other EU and national funding instruments.

need:
to make special efforts as regards existing EU programmes, such as the Youth Employment Initiative, Erasmus+ and Creative Europe,
with a view of reaching out to members of marginalised communities;
to create a network platform at EU level facilitating the exchange of best practices and joint problem solving;
for the funds to be used to improve living conditions and to facilitate access for women in marginalised communities to high-quality,
stable education, housing, health care, employment, childcare, social services;
to rigorously enforce and monitor EU legislation on discrimination and to carry out a thorough analysis of the causes of discrimination
and marginalisation, and to raise awareness of the fact that xenophobia and racism and all types of marginalisation leading to

Lastly, Parliament invited the Member States to offer an award for exemplary dedication to the integration and inclusion of marginalised groups
in implementing EU funds.
