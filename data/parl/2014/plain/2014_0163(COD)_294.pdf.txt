2014/0163(COD) - 28/05/2014 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 1515/2001 of 23 July 2001 on the measures that may be taken by the Community
following a report adopted by the WTO Dispute Settlement Body concerning anti-dumping and anti-subsidy matters.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 1515/2001 has been substantially amended several times. It is recalled that in 1987, the
Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum
requirement. The Edinburgh European Council in December 1992 confirmed the importance of codification as it offers certainty as to the law
applicable to a given matter at a given time.
The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an
accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments.
CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and transparency of Union law, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council
Regulation (EC) No 1515/2001 on the measures that may be taken by the Community following a report adopted by the WTO Dispute
Settlement Body concerning anti-dumping and anti-subsidy matters.
The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it; it fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does
no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself.
The purpose of this proposal is to establish specific provisions with a view to permitting the Union, where it considers this appropriate, to bring
a measure taken under Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 (anti-dumping measures) or Regulation (EC) No 597/2009 (anti-subsidy measures) into

conformity with the recommendations and rulings contained in a report adopted by the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) of the World Trade
Organisation (WTO) concerning anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures.
In concrete terms, the Commission may: (a) repeal or amend the disputed measure; or (b) adopt any other special implementing measure
deemed to be appropriate in the circumstances in order to bring the Union into conformity with the recommendations and rulings contained in
the report. In addition, the Commission should be able, where appropriate, to suspend or review such measures.
Any measures adopted pursuant to this Regulation shall take effect from the date of their entry into force and shall not serve as basis for the
reimbursement of the duties collected prior to that date, unless otherwise provided for.
Those measures should be adopted in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council. The
proposal stipulates that the advisory procedure should be used for the suspension of measures for a limited period of time given the effects of
such measures.

2014/0163(COD) - 14/11/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Legal Affairs adopted the report by Andrzej DUDA (ECR, PL) on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament
and of the Council on the measures that the Union may take following a report adopted by the WTO Dispute Settlement Body concerning
anti-dumping and anti-subsidy matters (codified text).
It recommended the European Parliament to adopt its position at first reading, taking over the Commission proposal as adapted to the
recommendations of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
The Consultative Working Party stated that the proposal in question contains a straightforward codification of the existing texts without any
change in their substance.

2014/0163(COD) - 11/02/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 635 votes to 52, with 13 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council on the measures that the Union may take following a report adopted by the WTO Dispute Settlement
Body concerning anti-dumping and anti-subsidy matters (codified text).
Parliament adopted its position at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure taking over the Commission proposal as adapted to
the recommendations of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
According to the Consultative Working Party, the proposal in question contains a straightforward codification of the existing texts without any
change in their substance.
The proposed regulation seeks to establish specific provisions with a view to permitting the Union, where it considers this appropriate, to bring
a measure taken under Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 (anti-dumping measures) or Regulation (EC) No 597/2009 (anti-subsidy measures) into
conformity with the recommendations and rulings contained in a report adopted by the WTO Dispute Settlement Body concerning
anti-dumping and anti-subsidy matters.

2014/0163(COD) - 11/03/2015 Final act
PURPOSE: codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 1515/2001 on the measures that may be taken by the Community following a report
adopted by the WTO Dispute Settlement Body concerning anti-dumping and anti-subsidy matters.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Regulation (EU) 2015/476 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the measures that the Union may take
following a report adopted by the WTO Dispute Settlement Body concerning anti-dumping and anti-subsidy matters (codification).
CONTENT: the Regulation codifies and repeals Council Regulation (EC) No 1515/2001 which has been substantially amended on several
occasions.
The new Regulation establishes specific provisions with a view to permitting the Union, where it considers this appropriate, to bring a measure
taken under Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 or Regulation (EC) No 597/2009 into conformity with the recommendations and rulings contained
in a report adopted by the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) of the World Trade Organisation (WTO).
In concrete terms, the Commission may: (i) repeal or amend the disputed measure; or (ii) adopt any other special implementing measure
deemed to be appropriate in the circumstances in order to bring the Union into conformity with the recommendations and rulings contained in
the report. In addition, the Commission should be able, where appropriate, to suspend or review such measures.
Any measures taken under the Regulation will take effect from the date of their entry into force, unless otherwise specified, and, therefore, do
not provide any basis for the reimbursement of the duties collected prior to that date.
Implementation measures will be adopted in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council
The advisory procedure will be used for the suspension of measures for a limited period of time given the effects of such measures.
