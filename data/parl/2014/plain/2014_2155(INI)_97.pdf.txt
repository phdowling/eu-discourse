Summary

2014/2155(INI) - 17/07/2014 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: to present the Commissions annual report on the protection of the European Unions financial interests.
CONTENT: the report covers the measures taken by the Commission and Member State in the fight against fraud, and their results. The
conclusions and recommendations included in the report are based on an analysis of the information available for the past five years
(2009-2013) and the problems and risks identified during this time.
Measures to protect the EUs financial interests - 2009-2013 : this series of measures started in 2011, when the Commission adopted its
multi-annual Anti-Fraud Strategy (CAFS). The Strategy was pivotal in raising awareness of fraud among the national authorities responsible.
and specific anti?fraud provisions were introduced into the new spending programmes for 2014-20. A second milestone was marked by the
adoption of the new OLAF Regulation in 2013.
In 2013, the Hercule II Programme (2007-13) continued to support actions aimed at strengthening the operational and investigative capacity of
customs and law enforcement agencies to combat fraud against the EU.
In 2012 and 2013, the Commission addressed the criminal law aspect of the protection of the
EU's financial interests by adopting proposals for:
·

a directive on the fight against fraud by means of criminal law in July 2012 which should remove loopholes in Member States'
anti-fraud legislation that impede the effective prosecution of fraudsters;

·

a regulation on the establishment of a European Public Prosecutors Office (EPPO) in July 2013.

The Commission has also taken a number of significant measures specifically to protect the revenue side of the EU budget. These include:
·

the proposal for an amendment of Regulation 515/97 on mutual administrative assistance in the customs area;

·

the Directives on a quick reaction mechanism against VAT fraud and a reverse charge mechanism;

·

the signing of the FCTC Protocol against illicit tobacco trade; and

·

the Communication on the fight against tobacco smuggling in 2013.

The Commission invites the co-legislators to swiftly complete the legislative work started and to adopt the pending proposals.
Detection and reporting of irregularities : in 2013, 1609 irregularities were reported as fraudulent (this includes both suspected and established
fraud), involving EUR 309 million in EU funds.
·

There are still significant differences in the number of fraudulent irregularities reported by each Member State, possibly due to
different approaches to detecting fraud and different interpretations when applying the legal framework.

·

Reported fraudulent irregularities have been decreasing on the revenue side.

·

On the expenditure side, their number dropped sharply between 2009 and 2011, but is increasing again.

·

The involvement of administrative bodies in detecting fraudulent irregularities has continued to increase and the use of falsified
documentation has become the most common way of committing fraudulent acts.

·

Irregularities not reported as fraudulent have increased, particularly in terms of amounts.

Preventive and corrective measures : in 2013, the Commission made several decisions to ensure that EU resources are spent according to the
principle of sound financial management and that EU financial interests are protected.
·

It made 217 decisions to interrupt payment (involving over EUR 5 billion) in the cohesion policy area. Of these, 131 were still open at
the end of 2013 (involving about EUR 2 billion of interrupted payments).

·

The Commission also made four new suspension decisions (three of these were still ongoing at the end of the year).

·

The Commission made financial corrections of over EUR 2.5 billion and issued recovery orders for EUR 955 million.

Anti-Fraud Coordination Services (AFCOS) : the report focuses on the requirement for each Member States to set up an Anti-Fraud
Coordination Service (AFCOS) to facilitate effective cooperation and exchange of information with the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).
So far, 23 Member States have appointed an AFCOS. These include all post-2004 Member States, plus Belgium, Denmark, Greece, France,
Italy, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal,
Finland and the United Kingdom.
The responsibilities of national AFCOS vary depending on the country. All Member States gave their AFCOS a coordinating role, albeit to
varying extents. Only a few Member States empowered their AFCOS to act in an investigative capacity.
The four Member States who have not formally designated their AFCOS yet Ireland, Spain, Luxembourg and Sweden - are expected to
finalise these before the end of 2014.
Amongst other recommendations, the Commission invites Member States to :
·

take into account the recommendations included in the anti-corruption reports and the best practices highlighted there ;

·

implement the legal requirements regarding main regulatory provisions for the 2014-20 spending programmes according to the
guidelines on fraud risk assessments and effective and proportionate ant-fraud measures, adopted with national authorities ;

·

review their control strategies to ensure that well-targeted, risk-based customs controls are in place to make it possible to effectively
detect fraudulent import operations ;

·

step up work to ensure timely reporting on and updating of fraud and irregularity cases. To ensure effective monitoring and follow-up,
reliable information on fraud and irregularity cases should be entered in OWNRES ;

·

correctly implement the EUs anti-fraud rules, based on carefully prepared and up-to-date fraud risk assessments, and supported by
adequate IT tools that will help to better target checks ;

·

ensure structured coordination (exchange of data and information) between anti-fraud bodies and managing authorities, which has
proved to be a best practice.

As some Member States report very low numbers of fraudulent irregularities, the Commission recommends strengthening their work on
detecting and/or reporting fraud: (i) in the area of cohesion policy: France, Spain, Ireland, Hungary, Denmark and the Netherlands; (ii) in the
area of agriculture: Lithuania, the Netherlands, Portugal and Finland.
It is recalled that the European Parliament resolution of 3 July 2013 welcomed OLAFs work on implementing the action plan on cigarette
smuggling and the Protocol on eliminating illicit trade in tobacco products.
The Commission supports the European Parliaments recommendation for Member States to make it easier for tax officials to access customs
data. It adopted new provisions on irregular payments, as requested by Parliament in discussions on the recovery system in the agricultural
sector.
Lastly, the Commission appreciates the Parliaments support for the Anti-Fraud Strategy for administrative arrangements with third countries
and international organisations.

2014/2155(INI) - 26/02/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading

The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Georgi PIRINSKI (ALDE, BG) on the Annual Report 2013 on the Protection of the
EUs Financial Interests Fight against fraud.
The report stressed that the diversity of legal and administrative systems in the Member States presents a challenging environment in which to
overcome irregularities and combat fraud. The fight against fraud, corruption and money laundering in the Union must be a priority for political
action by the Community institutions, and police and judicial cooperation between Member States is therefore crucial.
The main elements of the report may be summarised as follows:
Detection and reporting of non-fraudulent and fraudulent irregularities: Members stressed that close cooperation and coordination between the
Commission and the Member States must be strengthened in order to ensure that the Unions financial interests are protected effectively . They
also noted that number of cases of fraud and errors rose significantly, even though their financial impact decreased. The Commission is called
upon to analyse these cases better to prevent further loss of funds.
Members underlined that the current lack of results in the fight against fraud is not due to a lack of regulation but to a lack of implementation
and called for the EU funds to be properly managed and used in the most efficient way possible. The Commission is called upon to assume full
responsibility for the recovery of funds unduly paid from the EU budget and to establish uniform reporting principles in all Member States for
the purpose of collecting the appropriate comparable and accurate data.
The report also noted that the smuggling of heavily taxed goods and trafficking in counterfeit goods causes significant losses of revenue to the
budgets of the EU and the Member States.
As regards VAT, the report stated that in many Member States the VAT gap is continuously high owing to VAT fraud and avoidance.
Therefore, the Commission is called upon fully use its powers in order to help the Member States in their fight against VAT fraud and tax
avoidance.
Expenditure: the report noted the alarming 76 % increase in the number of irregularities reported as fraudulent regarding EU expenditure.
Members called for proposals to reduce the number of spending programmes and to target programmes at the Member States who are most
in need of support. Members expressed concern that in the agricultural sector the number of both irregularities in general and fraudulent
activities in particular increased significantly in 2013 as compared with 2012. Targeted measures are needed to combat this trend.
Problems identified and measures required: the report underlined its concerns as regards the persisting threats to the EU budget, which stem
from both failures to comply with the rules (non-fraudulent irregularities) and purposeful wrongdoings and criminal offences (i.e. fraud).
Members called on the Commission to develop common guidelines and indicators in order to narrow the gap between the different approaches
of the Member States and to develop a unified and comprehensive information bank on irregularities actually instigated and on measures
taken, thus providing authorities and citizens with trustworthy, comparable and centralised data for the implementation of effective corrective
measures.
Another problem is the delay between the occurrence of an irregularity and its detection. Reporting and management systems should be
improved in this regard.
Cooperation with anti-fraud bodies: the Commission is invited to create a mechanism for the exchange of information between the national
competent authorities with a view to helping to detect any transnational fraud in the context of the new MFF 2014-2020. Moreover, the
Commission is called upon to promote adequate legislation on the protection of whistle-blowers, access to information and the transparency of
lobbying, It should also further enhance its supervisory role in respect of EU budget expenditure.
European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO): Members reiterated their call for an independent and efficient EPPO, operating as a single office
which investigates, prosecutes and brings to court the perpetrators of criminal offences affecting the Unions financial interests.
Lastly, the report noted that the level of irregularities and fraud caused by non-compliance with public procurement rules remains high.
Members called on the Member States to transpose rapidly into national law the recently adopted Directives on public procurement and on the
award of concession contracts in order to further mitigate the risk of irregularities and fraud.

2014/2155(INI) - 11/03/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 636 votes to 9, with 62 abstentions, a resolution on the Annual Report 2013 on the Protection of the EUs
Financial Interests Fight against fraud.
The resolution stressed that the diversity of legal and administrative systems in the Member States presents a challenging environment in
which to overcome irregularities and combat fraud. The fight against fraud, corruption and money laundering in the Union must be a priority for
political action by the Community institutions, and police and judicial cooperation between Member States is therefore crucial.
The main elements of the resolution may be summarised as follows:
Detection and reporting of non-fraudulent and fraudulent irregularities: Parliament stressed that close cooperation and coordination between
the Commission and the Member States must be strengthened in order to ensure that the Unions financial interests are protected effectively . It
also noted that number of cases of fraud and errors rose significantly, even though their financial impact decreased. The Commission is called
upon to analyse these cases better to prevent further loss of funds.
Members underlined that the current lack of results in the fight against fraud is not due to a lack of regulation but to a lack of implementation
and called for the EU funds to be properly managed and used in the most efficient way possible. The Commission is called upon to assume full
responsibility for the recovery of funds unduly paid from the EU budget and to establish uniform reporting principles in all Member States for
the purpose of collecting the appropriate comparable and accurate data.
Revenue: Parliament welcomed the fact that 98% of Traditional Own Resources (TORs) are collected without significant problems. It stressed
however that the smuggling of heavily taxed goods causes significant losses of revenue to the budgets of the EU and the Member States, and
that direct losses in customs revenue as a result of cigarette smuggling alone are estimated at more than EUR 10 billion a year.

As regards VAT, the resolution stated that in many Member States the VAT gap is continuously high owing to VAT fraud and avoidance.
Therefore, the Commission is called upon fully use its powers in order to help the Member States in their fight against VAT fraud and tax
avoidance.
Expenditure: the resolution noted the alarming 76% increase in the number of irregularities reported as fraudulent regarding EU expenditure.
Parliament called for proposals to reduce the number of spending programmes and to target programmes at the Member States who are most
in need of support. Members expressed concern that in the agricultural sector the number of both irregularities in general and fraudulent
activities in particular increased significantly in 2013 as compared with 2012. Targeted measures are needed to combat this trend.
The resolution acknowledged that in 2013, as part of the Pre-Accession Assistance (PAA), 33 irregularities were reported as fraudulent,
involving an amount of EUR 14.4 million, and that those irregularities are mainly related to the Special Accession Programme for Agriculture
and Rural Development (SAPARD). In this regard, it called for proposals to reduce the number of spending programmes, in particular when
they partly overlap, and to target programmes, whenever possible, at the Member States who are most in need of support, so that not all
programmes necessarily benefit activities in all Member States.
Problems identified and measures required: Parliament underlined its concerns as regards the persisting threats to the EU budget, which stem
from both failures to comply with the rules (non-fraudulent irregularities) and purposeful wrongdoings and criminal offences (i.e. fraud). It called
on the Commission to develop common guidelines and indicators in order to narrow the gap between the different approaches of the Member
States and to develop a unified and comprehensive information bank on irregularities actually instigated and on measures taken, thus
providing authorities and citizens with trustworthy, comparable and centralised data for the implementation of effective corrective measures.
Another problem is the delay between the occurrence of an irregularity and its detection. Reporting and management systems should be
improved in this regard.
Cooperation with anti-fraud bodies: the Commission is invited to create a mechanism for the exchange of information between the national
competent authorities with a view to helping to detect any transnational fraud in the context of the new MFF 2014-2020. Moreover, the
Commission is called upon to promote adequate legislation on the protection of whistle-blowers, access to information and the transparency of
lobbying, It should also further enhance its supervisory role in respect of EU budget expenditure.
AFCOS: Parliament welcomed the establishment of anti-fraud coordination services (AFCOS) in Member States which aims to facilitate
effective cooperation and the exchange of information with OLAF and assist in facilitating better reporting of irregularities and contribute
towards a balanced interpretation of the relevant EU acts. It is nevertheless concerned by the substantial discrepancies already existing
between the different AFCOS established in the Member States in terms of functions, tasks and powers as well as human resources allocated.
Non-compliance with procurement rules: the resolution noted that the level of irregularities and fraud caused by non-compliance with public
procurement rules remains high. Parliament called on the Member States to transpose rapidly into national law the recently adopted Directives
on public procurement and on the award of concession contracts in order to further mitigate the risk of irregularities and fraud.
Investigations and OLAF: the resolution noted that in 2013 OLAF issued 353 recommendations for administrative, disciplinary, financial or
judicial action to be taken by the relevant EU institutions, bodies, offices, agencies or the competent national authorities. However, Parliament
is concerned that the rate of indictment following OLAFs judicial recommendations for the period 2006-2013 is only about 54%. It is worried as
the low rate of indictment also sheds a bad light on the quality and usability of OLAFs investigative results. It called on the OLAF Supervisory
Committee to inform it about the duration of OLAF investigations. It also deemed that a fully-fledged and proper oversight over OLAFs affairs
by the Supervisory Committee (without interference in ongoing investigations) is indispensable. It regretted the lack of information available on
conviction rates in cases involving offences against the Unions budget. The Commission is urgently called upon to improve the effectiveness
of OLAF.
