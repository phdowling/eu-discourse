2014/0322(NLE) - 28/10/2014 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to allow Croatia to adhere to the Convention of 26 May 1997, drawn up on the basis of Article K.3(2)(c) of the Treaty on European
Union, on the fight against corruption involving officials of the European Communities or officials of Member States of the European Union.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: the 2011 Accession Treaty of Croatia has introduced a simplified system for the accession of Croatia to the conventions (and
protocols) concluded by the Member States on the basis of Art. 34 TEU. It is no longer necessary to negotiate and conclude specific accession
protocols (which would have to be ratified by the 28 Member States): the Act of Accession simply state that Croatia accedes to the
conventions and protocols by virtue of the Act.
To that effect, the Council shall adopt a decision in order to determine the date on which these conventions shall enter into force for Croatia
and to make all the necessary adjustments to these conventions required by reason of the accession of the new Member State (which would
include, in any event, the adoption of the conventions in the Croatian language, so that these versions can be "equally authentic").
The Council shall act on a recommendation of the Commission, after consulting the European Parliament.
CONTENT: this proposal recommends the Council to allow Croatia to adhere to the Convention of 26 May 1997, drawn up on the basis of
Article K.3(2)(c) of the Treaty on European Union, on the fight against corruption involving officials of the European Communities or officials of
Member States of the European Union.
N.B.: Annex I of the Act of Accession lists the six conventions and protocols concerned in the area of justice and home affairs.
