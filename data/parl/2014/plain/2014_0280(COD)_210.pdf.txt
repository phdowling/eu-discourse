2014/0280(COD) - 29/09/2014 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to codify Council Regulation (EC) No 385/96 on the protection against injurious pricing of vessels.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the Council and the European Parliament.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and rationality, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No
385/96 of 29 January 1996 on protection against injurious pricing of vessels.
Council Regulation (EC) No 385/966 has been substantially amended. It is recalled that on 1 April 1987, the Commission decided to instruct its
staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Edinburgh
European Council (December 1992) confirmed this, stressing the importance of codification.
The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an
accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments.
The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it. Furthermore, it fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and
hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself.

2014/0280(COD) - 22/06/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Legal Affairs adopted the report by Ji?í MATÁLKA (GUE/NGL, CZ) on the proposal for a regulation of the European
Parliament and of the Council on protection against injurious pricing of vessels (codified text).
The committee recommended the European Parliament to adopt its position at first reading taking over the Commission proposal as adapted
to the recommendations of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission.

According to the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, the proposal
in question contains a straightforward codification of the existing texts without any change in their substance.

2014/0280(COD) - 07/07/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 671 votes to 27, with 7 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council on protection against injurious pricing of vessels (codified text).
Parliament adopted its position at first reading taking over the Commission proposal.
The Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission concluded that the
proposal in question contains a straightforward codification of the existing texts without any change in their substance.
The codified version of Council Regulation (EC) No 385/96 on protection against injurious pricing of vessels enables the Union to take action
against any injuriously priced vessel whose sale at less than normal value causes injury to the Union industry.
The term Union industry is defined by reference to the capability to build a like vessel and to provide that parties related to exporters may be
excluded from such industry.
The new Regulation should, inter alia:
set out clear and detailed rules on the calculation of the normal value; such value should where possible be based on a representative
sale of a like vessel in the ordinary course of trade in the exporting country;
define the export price;
set out the procedural and substantive conditions for lodging a complaint against injurious pricing, including the extent to which it
should be supported by the Union industry;
lay down the information on the buyer of the vessel, injurious pricing, injury and causation which such complaint should contain:
specify the procedures for the rejection of complaints or the initiation of proceedings;
set out clearly the rules and procedures to be followed during the investigation, in particular the rules whereby interested parties are to
make themselves known, present their views and submit information within specified time limits, if such views and information are to
be taken into account. It is also necessary to provide that the termination of cases should, irrespective of whether an injurious pricing
charge is imposed or not, take place no later than one year from the date of initiation or the date of delivery of the vessel, as the case
may be;
specify the manner in which interested parties should be given notice of the information which the authorities require;
set out precise rules for the denial of the right to load and unload in Union ports to vessels built by shipbuilders subject to
countermeasures;
provide measures for the treatment of confidential information so that business secrets are not divulged.

2014/0280(COD) - 08/06/2016 Final act
PURPOSE: to codify Council Regulation (EC) n° 385/96 regarding combatting the injurious pricing of vessels.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Regulation (EU) 2016/1035 of the European Parliament and of the Council on protection against injurious pricing of
vessels (codification).
CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and rationality, the Regulation codifies and repeals Council Regulation (EC) No 385/96, which has been
substantially amended.
The Regulation responds to the need to provide for an effective means of protection against sales of ships below their normal value. It
transposes into EU law the Shipbuilding Injurious Pricing Code (the IPI Code), which is mainly based on the 1994 Anti-Dumping Agreement,
annexed to the Agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation.
The IPI code is annexed to annexed to the Shipbuilding Agreement, concluded on 21 December 1994 following multilateral negotiations
conducted under the auspices of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.
The Regulations sets out the principle that an injurious pricing charge may be imposed on the builder of any injuriously priced vessel whose
sale to a buyer other than a buyer of the country in which the vessel originates causes injury to Union industry.
The term Union industry is defined by reference to the capability to build a like vessel.
A vessel is to be considered as being injuriously priced if the export price of the vessel sold is less than a comparable price for a like vessel, in
the ordinary course of trade, when sold to a buyer of the exporting country.
The Regulation applies to all self-propelled sea-going vessels of 100 gross tonnes and above, used for transportation of goods or persons or
for performance of a specialised service (for example, ice breakers and dredgers) and any tug of 365 kW and above.
The new codified Regulation establishes, inter alia:
detailed rules on the calculation of the normal value. In particular, such value should, where possible, be based on a representative
sale of a like vessel in the ordinary course of trade in the exporting country;
detailed guidance as to the factors which may be relevant for the determination of whether the injuriously priced sale has caused
material injury or is threatening to cause injury. In demonstrating that the price level of the sale concerned is responsible for injury
sustained by the Union industry, attention should be given to prevailing market conditions in the Union;
the procedural and substantive conditions for lodging a complaint against injurious pricing, including the extent to which it should be
supported by the Union industry;
the procedures for the rejection of complaints or the initiation of proceedings;
the rules and procedures to be followed during the investigation, in particular the rules whereby interested parties are to make

themselves known, present their views and submit information within specified time limits, if such views and information are to be
taken into account; the termination of cases should, irrespective of whether an injurious pricing charge is imposed or not, take place
no later than 1 year from the date of initiation or the date of delivery of the vessel, as the case may be; the investigation may be
terminated without the imposition of an injurious pricing charge if the sale of the injuriously priced vessel is definitively and
unconditionally voided or if an alternative equivalent remedy is accepted;
rules for the denial of the right to load and unload in Union ports to vessels built by shipbuilders subject to countermeasures;
rules allowing the Commission to carry out visits to verify information provided on injurious pricing and injury;
provision for the treatment of confidential information so that business secrets are not divulged.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 20.7.2016. The Regulation applies from the date of entry into force of the Shipbuilding Agreement.
