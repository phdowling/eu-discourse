OJ L 068 13.03.2015, p. 0047 Summary

2014/2038(BUD) - 11/06/2014 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: to mobilise the European Union Solidarity Fund to provide the sum of EUR 50 000 000 in commitment and payment appropriations
which shall be included in the 2015 budget for the payment of advances in order to meet the most urgent needs.
PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
CONTENT: the European Union created the European Union Solidarity Fund to show solidarity with the population of regions struck by
disasters.
Article 10 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) N° 1311/2013 allows the mobilisation of the Fund within the annual ceiling of EUR 500 million (2011
prices), over and above the relevant headings of the financial framework.
The conditions of eligibility to the Fund are detailed in the Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council, amending Council
Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002, which foresees that an amount of up to a maximum of EUR 50 000 000 in both commitment and payment
appropriations shall be included in the budget for the payment of advances.
It is proposed that the Commission should include these amounts in the Draft Budget 2015.

2014/2038(BUD) - 15/12/2014 Budgetary report tabled for plenary, 1st reading
The Committee on Budgets adopted the report by Siegfried MURE?AN (EPP, RO) on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament
and of the Council on the mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund, in accordance with point 11 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of
2 December 2013 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline, on cooperation in budgetary
matters and on sound financial management.
Members recalled that, in line with Regulation (EU) No 661/2014 which amended Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002, an amount of EUR 50 million
is made available for the payment of advances through appropriations in the general budget of the Union.
Members also recalled that the current Decision annexed is not linked to a specific case of a natural disaster. Instead, it aims at entering in the
Budget 2015 the amount of EUR 50 million in commitments and payments, which corresponds to advances that will need to be paid out in a
speedier and more efficient way in the event of a natural disaster next year.
This is the direct result of the new provision of the new EU Solidarity Fund Regulation, acknowledging the need for Member States to receive
financial support to respond to a natural disaster more rapidly than is possible through the normal procedure. This position prevailed in the
relevant negotiations and an amount of up to a maximum EUR 50 million should be budgeted annually for this purpose.
Therefore, the committee called on the European Parliament to approve the decision annexed to this motion for a resolution and to include the
amounts in the Budget 2015.

2014/2038(BUD) - 17/12/2014 Final act
PURPOSE: to mobilise the European Union Solidarity Fund to provide the sum of EUR 50 million in commitment and payment appropriations
which shall be included in the 2015 budget for the payment of advances in order to meet the most urgent needs.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision (EU) 2015/422 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the mobilisation of the European Union
Solidarity Fund.
CONTENT: the European Union created the European Union Solidarity Fund to show solidarity with the population of regions struck by
disasters.
Article 10 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) N° 1311/2013 allows the mobilisation of the Fund within the annual ceiling of EUR 500 million (2011

prices), over and above the relevant headings of the financial framework.
The conditions of eligibility to the Fund are detailed in the Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council, amending Council
Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002, which foresees that an amount of up to a maximum of EUR 50 000 000 in both commitment and payment
appropriations shall be included in the budget for the payment of advances.
The aim of this Decision is to formalise this principle.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 17.12.2014.
