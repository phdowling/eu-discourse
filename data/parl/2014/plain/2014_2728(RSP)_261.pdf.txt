Summary

The European Parliament adopted a resolution on the freedom of expression and assembly in Egypt.
The resolution was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ECR, ALDE, GUE/NGL, and Greens/EFA groups.
The European Parliament condemned strongly all acts of violence, incitement, hate speech, harassment, intimidation or censorship against
political opponents, protesters, journalists, bloggers, trade unionists, womens rights activists, civil society actors and minorities and called on
the Egyptian authorities to commit to dialogue and non-violence as well as to inclusive governance.
Deeply concerned over a series of recent court decisions in Egypt, including the lengthy jail terms handed down on 23 June 2014 to three Al
Jazeera journalists as well as the confirmation of death sentences against 183 people, Parliament condemned the harassment, detention and
prosecution of national and international journalists and civil society actors. Overall, it regretted the existence of media and web censorship
and the fact that access to some blogs and social networks is limited.
Parliament called on the Egyptian authorities to:
immediately and unconditionally release all those detained, convicted and/or sentenced for peacefully exercising their rights of
freedom of expression and association;
as well as all human rights defenders; calls on the Egyptian judiciary to ensure that all court proceedings in the country meet the
requirements of a free and fair trial and to ensure respect for defendants rights; calls on the Egyptian authorities to order independent
and impartial investigations into all allegations of ill-treatment and ensure that all detainees have access to any medical attention they
may require;
repeal or amend the Protest Law 107 and to review the new NGO bill presented by the Ministry of Social Solidarity, in line international
standards and the countrys international obligations;
ensure that all existing and future legislation in the country is in compliance with the constitution and those standards and obligations;
change course and take concrete steps to ensure that the provisions of the new Constitution on fundamental rights and freedoms;
reform the judicial authority law to ensure a genuine separation of powers that would lead to the independent and impartial
administration of justice.
Members stressed that Egypts anti-terrorism law has also been used to bring convictions in a number of trials. They called on the authorities to
immediately establish an official moratorium on executions as a first step towards abolition.
LGBT people: Members regretted the fact that, despite a new law on sexual harassment, violence against women has been worsening,
especially in the public sphere, with dozens of cases of rape and sexual violence occurring during protests. They urged the Egyptian
authorities to cease criminalising LGBT people for expressing their sexual orientation and right of assembly, on the basis of the debauchery
law and to release all LGBT people arrested and imprisoned under that law.
Improving rights and freedoms: Parliament reaffirmed that freedom of the press and media are vital elements for democracy and an open
society, and that as such they should be among the focal points of EU action concerning Egypt. Once again, it urged the Council, the
Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (VP/HR) and the Commission to
work actively on the basis of the principle of conditionality ( more for more), and taking account of the serious economic challenges faced by
Egypt, in the Unions bilateral relations with and financial support for the country.
Moreover, Parliament called on the VP/HR to:
clarify the status of: (i) the planned justice Reform programme; (ii) the EU budget support programmes; (iii) the trade and domestic
enhancement programme; and (iv) Egypts participation in EU regional programmes such as Euromed Police and Euromed Justice;
muster EU support in favour of a resolution on the situation in Egypt at the next session of the UN Human Rights Council, which would
initiate an international investigation into the killings of protesters and allegations of torture.
