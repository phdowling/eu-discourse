2014/0287(COD) - 01/10/2014 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: as from 1 January 2015, to maintain the level of duty rates applicable to Ecuador to those which apply from the date of initialling of
the Protocol of Accession of this country to the Trade Agreement concluded between the EU and Colombia/Peru.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the Council and the European Parliament.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: on 17 July 2014 the negotiations were concluded with Ecuador for its accession to the Trade Agreement concluded between
the EU and Colombia/Peru. As a result of these negotiations, a Protocol of Accession by Ecuador to the Agreement was initialled between the
parties.
In order to avoid unnecessary trade disruption pending the completion of the procedures for the approval and application of the Protocol of
Accession, it is necessary to ensure that customs duties applied on the date of initialling of the Protocol of Accession are not increased and
that no new customs duties are applied on products originating in Ecuador.
To this end, the proposed Regulation provides for the maintenance of the level of duty rates that were applicable to Ecuador on the date of
initialling of the Protocol of Accession.
CONTENT: this proposal seeks to put in place an interim reciprocal arrangement for the establishment of a free-trade area with Ecuador in
order to avoid unnecessary trade disruption, following the initialling of the Protocol of Accession.
As from 1 January 2015, customs duties applied on the date of initialling of the Protocol of Accession are not increased nor new customs
duties applied on products originating in Ecuador.
Duration of the application: the Regulation shall apply from 1 January 2015. It shall expire six months after the Protocol of Accession enters
into force or, where appropriate, is applied provisionally, or on 31 December 2016, whichever occurs first.
Condition for the application: Ecuador should abstain from introducing new duties or charges having equivalent effect or new quantitative
restrictions or measures having equivalent effect for imports originating in the Union, or from increasing existing levels of duties or charges or
from introducing any other restrictions from [the date of initialling of the Protocol of Accession].
Ecuador should also:
maintain its commitment to core international conventions on human and labour rights, environmental protection and good
governance;
be subject to benefit from the tariff treatment provided under this Regulation should be conditional on compliance by Ecuador with the
relevant rules of origin of products and the procedures related thereto.
In the event of failure to comply with any of the conditions laid down in this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the
Commission to suspend temporarily in whole or in part the tariff treatment provided therein. Those powers should be exercised in accordance
with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and the Council.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal maintains the current market access arrangements and in this sense does not have any additional
financial implications for the EU budget.
The absence of its application would, however, entail a potential increase in the customs revenue collection. The amount of this customs
revenue collection is difficult to predict, but would in any case be relatively small. The duty savings incurred by current market access regime
enjoyed by Ecuador and which lapses on 1 January 2015 are in the range of EUR 215 million (based on 2013 trade figures).

2014/0287(COD) - 08/12/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on International Trade adopted the report by Helmut SCHOLZ (GUE/NGL, DE) on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council on the tariff treatment for goods originating from Ecuador.
It recommended the European Parliament to adopt its position at first reading taking over the Commission proposal.

2014/0287(COD) - 17/12/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 523 votes to 39, with 102 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council on the tariff treatment for goods originating from Ecuador.
Parliament adopted its position at first reading without making amendments to the Commission proposal.
On 17 July 2014 the negotiations were concluded with Ecuador for its accession to the Trade Agreement concluded between the EU and
Colombia/Peru. As a result of these negotiations, a Protocol of Accession by Ecuador to the Agreement was initialled between the parties.
In order to avoid unnecessary trade disruption until the provisional application of this Free Trade Agreement between the European Union and
Ecuador, the proposal aims to ensure that customs duties applied on the date of initialling of the Protocol of Accession of Ecuador to the
EU-Colombia/Peru Free Trade Agreement are not increased and that no new customs duties are applied on products originating in Ecuador.
To this end, the proposed Regulation provides for the maintenance of the level of duty rates that were applicable to and by Ecuador on the
date of initialling of the Protocol of Accession.
The proposed Regulation will apply as of 1 January 2015 and until six months after the Protocol of Accession enters into force (or, where
appropriate, is applied provisionally), or until 31 December 2016, whichever occurs first.

2014/0287(COD) - 18/12/2014 Final act
PURPOSE: as from 1 January 2015, to maintain the level of duty rates applicable to Ecuador to those which apply from the date of initialling of
the Protocol of Accession of this country to the Trade Agreement concluded between the EU and Colombia/Peru.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Regulation (EU) No 1384/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the tariff treatment for goods originating
in Ecuador.
CONTENT: on 17 July 2014, the negotiations were concluded with Ecuador for its accession to the Trade Agreement concluded between the
EU and Colombia/Peru. As a result of these negotiations, a Protocol of Accession by Ecuador to the Agreement was initialled between the
parties.
In order to avoid unnecessary trade disruption pending the completion of the procedures for the approval and application of the Protocol of
Accession, the Regulation ensures that customs duties applied on the date of initialling of the Protocol of Accession are not increased and that
no new customs duties are applied on products originating in Ecuador.
The Regulation provides for the maintenance of the level of duty rates applicable to goods originating in Ecuador on 12 December 2014 as
from 1 January 2015.

protection and good governance,
cooperate with the Commission in providing the requested information on the compliance with the above conventions,

In the case of non-compliance, the Commission may adopt implementing acts in order to suspend the tariff treatment temporarily, in respect of
all or certain goods originating in Ecuador.
A safeguard clause would enable the Common Customs Tariff duties to be applied with regard to any goods originating in Ecuador which
cause, or threaten to cause, serious difficulties to Union producers of like or directly competing products, subject to an investigation by the
Commission.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 31.12.2014.
APPLICATION: from 01.01.2015. This Regulation should be applied until six months after the entry into force or date of provisional application
