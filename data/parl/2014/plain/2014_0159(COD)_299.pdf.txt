2014/0159(COD) - 27/05/2014 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: codification of Regulation (EEC) No 1692/73 of the Council of 25 June 1973 on the safeguard measures provided for in the
Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Kingdom of Norway.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and transparency of Union law, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Regulation
(EEC) No 1692/73 on the safeguard measures provided for in the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Kingdom
of Norway.
Regulation (EEC) No 1692/73 of the Council has been substantially amended several times. It is recalled that in 1987, the Commission
decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement.
The Edinburgh European Council in December 1992 confirmed the importance of codification as it offers certainty as to the law applicable to a
given matter at a given time.
The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an
accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments.
The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it; it fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does
no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself.

2014/0159(COD) - 10/03/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading

The Committee on Legal Affairs adopted the report of Andrzej DUDA (ECR, PL) on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament
and of the Council on the safeguard measures provided for in the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Kingdom
of Norway (codified text).
The parliamentary committee recommended that the European Parliament adopts its position at first reading, taking over the Commission
proposal as adapted to the recommendations of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council
and the Commission.
The Consultative Working Party concluded that the proposal is a straightforward codification of existing texts, without any change in their
substance.

2014/0159(COD) - 29/04/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 656 votes to 37, with 5 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council on the safeguard measures provided for in the Agreement between the European Economic
Community and the Kingdom of Norway (codified text).
Parliament adopted its position at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure taking over the Commission proposal.
According to the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the proposal in question contains a
straightforward codification of the existing texts without any change in their substance.
The proposal to codify Regulation (EEC) No 1692/73 of the Council concerns the rules necessary for implementing the safeguard clauses and
precautionary measures provided for in Articles 22 to 27 of the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Kingdom of
Norway which was signed in Brussels on 14 May 1973.
The implementation of the bilateral safeguard clauses of the Agreement requires uniform conditions for the adoption of safeguard measures.
Those measures should be adopted in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council on
comitology.
Under this proposed Regulation, the Commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases
relating to situations referred to in the Agreement or in the case of export aids that have a direct and immediate effect on trade, imperative
grounds of urgency so require.
