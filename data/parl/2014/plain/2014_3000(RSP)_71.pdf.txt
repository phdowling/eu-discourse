Summary

The European Parliament adopted by 582 votes to 1 with 57 abstentions a resolution on Sudan: the case of Dr Amin Mekki Medani a
renowned human rights activist and former President of the Sudan Human Rights Monitor (SHRM). The resolution was tabled by the
Greens/EFA, EPP, ECR, EFDD, ALDE, GUE/NGL and S&D groups. Parliament strongly condemned the arbitrary arrest and detention of Dr
Medani and other activists on 6 December 2014 and called for their immediate and unconditional release. It called on the Sudanese
Government to review its National Security Act, which allowed the detention of suspects for up to four and a half months without any form of
judicial review. It also denounced the governments NGO bill, which restricted the ability of NGOs to deliver much-needed humanitarian relief to
Sudan and compounded the already difficult circumstances NGOs face in the country.
Whilst welcoming the National Dialogue process, Members remained deeply concerned at the ongoing conflicts in Sudan, notably in Darfur,
Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile, and the accompanying violations of humanitarian and human rights law, together with a serious
humanitarian emergency. They stressed the fact that the National Dialogue would only succeed if carried out in an atmosphere where the
freedoms of expression, the media, association and assembly were guaranteed, and they called, accordingly, for all political prisoners to be
released and arbitrary detention practices immediately stopped. The Sudanese Government, the opposition and the armed movements were
asked to use the momentum of the National Dialogue to demonstrate the leadership necessary to put Sudan on a path to peace, prosperity
and justice.
Parliament called on the Commission and the EEAS to:

continue their support for dialogue between Sudan and South Sudan and neighbouring countries, to implement
the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement in full, as well as the 2012 Addis Ababa Agreements, and to
address any outstanding issues;
support the National Dialogue, the African Union High-Level Implementation Panel (AUHIP) and the Joint
UN-African Union Special Representative in Darfur;
On the worsening humanitarian situation in numerous regions of Sudan, Members called on the Government of Sudan and on armed
movements to guarantee safe, timely and unhindered humanitarian access to all areas for humanitarian agencies.
Lastly, they expressed concern about the continuing and frequent violations of womens rights in Sudan, exhorting the Sudanese authorities to
sign and ratify the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.
