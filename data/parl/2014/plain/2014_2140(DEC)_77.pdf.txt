Summary

2014/2140(DEC) - 27/03/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Ingeborg GRÄßLE (EPP, DE) on the Court of Auditors' special reports in the
context of the 2013 Commission discharge.
Members recalled that the special reports of the Court of Auditors provided information on issues of concern related to the implementation of
funds, which were thus useful for Parliament in exercising its role of discharge authority. They specified that Parliaments observations on the
special reports of the Court of Auditors form an integral part of Parliament's resolution on general discharge in respect of the implementation of
the general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2013, Section III Commission.
Members went on to discuss each of the special reports and made certain recommendations designed to improve the use of Community
funding.

and better-focused approach would improve the effectiveness of the Commissions verification"

Special Report No 5/2014 of the Court of Auditors entitled "European banking supervision taking shape - EBA and its changing
context"
Special Report No 6/2014 of the Court of Auditors entitled "Cohesion policy funds support to renewable energy generation has it
achieved good results?"

incubators?"
