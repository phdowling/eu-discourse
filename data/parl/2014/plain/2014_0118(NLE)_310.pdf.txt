2014/0118(NLE) - 31/03/2014 Initial legislative proposal
PURPOSE: the conclusion of a Protocol to the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an Association between the European Community
and its Member States, of the one part, and Tunisia, of the other part, on a Framework Agreement between the European Union and Tunisia
on the general principles for the participation of that country in Union programmes.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to it.

BACKGROUND: as part of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), the gradual opening up of certain European Union programmes and
agencies to ENP partner countries is one of many measures to promote reform, modernisation and transition in the European Union?s
neighbourhood. The Commission has expanded on this in its Communication ?on the general approach to enable European Neighbourhood
Policy partner countries to participate in Community agencies and Community programmes?. The Council endorsed this approach in
conclusions on 5 March 2007.
The Council, on 18 June 2007, issued directives to the Commission to negotiate Framework Agreements with Algeria, Armenia, Azerbaijan,
Egypt, Georgia, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Moldova, Morocco, the Palestinian Authority, Tunisia and Ukraine, on the general principles for their
participation in Community programmes. To date, Protocols have been signed with Armenia, Georgia, Israel, Jordan, Moldova, Morocco and
Ukraine.
In December 2013, Tunisia expressed its interest in participating in the broad range of programmes open to partner countries of the European
Neighbourhood Policy. The text of the Protocol negotiated with Tunisia is attached and the subject of this proposal. It is now appropriate for the
European Union to conclude the protocol.
LEGAL BASIS: Article 212 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) and Article 218(7)
thereof.
CONTENT: this is a proposal for a Council Decision on the conclusion of the Protocol. This Protocol contains a Framework Agreement on the
general principles for the participation of Tunisia in Union programmes. It contains standard conditions that should be applied to all European
Neighbourhood Policy partner countries with whom such protocols are to be concluded.
Objectives: the protocol seeks to define the financial and technical rules permitting Tunisia to participate in certain EU programmes.
The horizontal framework established by the Protocol sets out principles for economic, financial and technical cooperation measure and allows
Tunisia to receive technical assistance, in particular financial assistance, from the European Union pursuant to the European Union
programmes.

2014/0118(NLE) - 10/12/2014 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude the Protocol to the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities
and their Member States, of the one part, and Tunisia, of the other part, on a Framework Agreement between the European Union and Tunisia
on the general principles for the participation of Tunisia in Union programmes.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to it.
BACKGROUND: in accordance with a Council Decision, the Protocol to the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an association
between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Tunisia, of the other part, on a Framework Agreement
between the European Union and Tunisia on the general principles for the participation of Tunisia in Union programmes was signed on behalf
of the Union.
The objective of the Protocol is to lay down the financial and technical rules enabling Tunisia to participate in certain Union programmes.
The horizontal framework established by the Protocol constitutes an economic, financial and technical cooperation measure which allows for
access to assistance, in particular financial assistance, to be provided by the Union pursuant to those Union programmes. That framework
applies only to those Union programmes for which the relevant constitutive legal acts provide for the possibility of the participation of Tunisia.
The Protocol should now be approved.
CONTENT: under this proposed Decision, the Council is called upon to approve, on behalf of the Union, the Protocol to the
Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part,
and Tunisia, of the other part, on a Framework Agreement between the European Union and Tunisia on the general principles for the
participation of Tunisia in Union programmes.
For further details of the Protocol, please refer to the Commissions initial proposal dated 31/03/2014.

2014/0118(NLE) - 17/09/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Foreign Affairs adopted the report by Pier Antonio PANZERI (S&D, IT) on the draft Council decision on the conclusion of
the Protocol to the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States,
of the one part, and the Republic of Tunisia, of the other part, on a Framework Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of
Tunisia on the general principles for the participation of the Republic of Tunisia in Union programmes.
The committee recommended that Parliament gave its consent to the conclusion of the Protocol.
It justified its recommendation by noting that Tunisia was the birthplace of the Arab Spring. Thus far, it was the only country in the Middle East
North Africa (MENA) region to survive this social and political experiment.
Over recent years, the Tunisian economy had deteriorated markedly, both domestically and in the international arena, especially in terms of its
trade with Europe, which remained its main partner. In light of this, it was vital for the Tunisian issue to become an EU priority, with the EU
making concrete economic and investment commitments aimed at supporting the country's fragile transition to democracy.
Bearing this in mind, the EU should also increase cooperation through programmes such as Erasmus+ other programmes aimed at developing
people-to-people contacts. Tunisia should also be given the opportunity to join the missions and activities of the European Common Security
and Defence Policy (CSDP).

2014/0118(NLE) - 07/10/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading

conclusion of the Protocol to the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their
Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Tunisia, of the other part, on a Framework Agreement between the European Union and
the Republic of Tunisia on the general principles for the participation of the Republic of Tunisia in Union programmes.
Parliament gave its consent to the conclusion of the Protocol. This Protocol shall enable Tunisia to participate in programmes such as
Erasmus+ other programmes aimed at developing people-to-people contacts.
