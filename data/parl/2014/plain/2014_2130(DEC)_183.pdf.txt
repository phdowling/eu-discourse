2014/2130(DEC) - 30/07/2014 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: presentation by the Commission of the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2013, as part of
the 2013 discharge procedure.
Analysis of the accounts of the SESAR Joint Undertaking.
CONTENT: this Commission document sets out the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2013 as
prepared on the basis of the information presented by the institutions, organisations and bodies of the EU, in accordance with Article 129 (2) of
the Financial Regulation applicable to the EU's General Budget, including the SESAR Joint Undertaking.
The document contains the figures on which the discharge procedure is based.
Discharge procedure of the EU Joint Undertakings: the EU Budget finances a wide range of policies and programmes throughout the EU. In
accordance with the priorities set by the European Parliament and the Council in the multi-annual financial framework (MFF), the European
Commission carries out specific programmes, activities and projects in the field with the technical support of some specialised agencies.
The consolidated annual accounts of the EU provide information on the activities of the institutions, agencies and other bodies of the EU from
a budgetary and accrual accounting perspective.
The consolidated reports on the implementation of the general budget of the EU include the budget implementation of all Institutions. Agencies
and Joint Undertakings (JUs) do not have a separate budget inside the EU budget ; and they are partially financed by a Commission budget
subsidy.
Each JU is subject to its own discharge procedure.
SESAR: in 2013, the tasks and budget of the Joint Undertaking were as follows:

description of the tasks of the Joint Undertaking: SESAR Joint Undertaking, located in Brussels (BE), was set up in 2007 by
Regulation (EC) 219/2007 for a period extending to 31 December 2017. The aim of this Joint Undertaking is to ensure the
modernisation of the European air traffic management system and the rapid implementation of the European air traffic management
Master Plan by coordinating and concentrating all relevant research and development efforts in the EU;
accounts of the JU: the budget for SESAR's development phase is provided in equal parts by the EU, by Eurocontrol and by public
and private partners. At 31 December 2013, the Commission held 42.26% of the ownership participation in SESAR. The total
Commission contribution foreseen for SESAR (from 2007 to 2013) is EUR 700 million. The cumulative unrecognised share of losses is
EUR 205 million.
Please also consult SESAR Joint Undertakings final accounts.

2014/2130(DEC) - 21/10/2014 Court of Auditors: opinion, report
PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the SESAR Joint Undertaking for the financial year
2013, together with the Joint Undertakings replies.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit concerned, amongst others, the annual accounts of the SESAR Joint Undertaking.
Statement of assurance: pursuant to the provisions of Article 287 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the Court
has audited:
the annual accounts of the SESAR Joint Undertaking, which comprise the financial statements and the reports on the implementation
of the budget for the financial year ended 31 December 2013;
the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying those accounts.
Opinion on the reliability of the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the Joint Undertakings annual accounts present fairly, in all material respects,
its financial position as at 31 December 2013 and the results of its operations and cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the
provisions of its financial rules and the accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
Opinion on the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the transactions underlying the annual
accounts for the year ended 31 December 2013 are, in all material respects, legal and regular.
The audit approach taken by the Court comprises analytical audit procedures, testing of transactions at the level of the Joint Undertaking and
an assessment of key controls of the supervisory and control systems. This is supplemented by evidence provided by the work of other
auditors and an analysis of management representations and of annual activity reports.
The 2013 audit placed special emphasis on ex post audits.
At the end of this audit, the Court concluded the following:
internal audit function: in accordance with the coordinated strategic audit plan for the SJU for 2012-2014, the IAS carried out a limited
review of the closing procedure applicable to grant management projects and a risk assessment of information technology;
conflicts of interest: the SJU has put in place specific measures to prevent conflicts of interest with respect to its three key
stakeholders: Administrative Board members, employees and experts. These are adequately documented in a comprehensive written
procedure, which was updated in 2012.
Cross-cutting remarks for all the Joint undertakings: the prevention of conflicts of interest is addressed by most Joint Undertakings by the
adoption of specific rules and by the development of tools to document all related information. An Interim Evaluation was performed over 2013
assessing all Joint Undertakings in terms of relevance, efficiency, effectiveness and research quality. The reports, while positive, also
highlighted areas for further improvement. In general, all Joint Undertakings have produced reliable accounts but there is room for
improvement.
Joint Undertakings replies: the Joint Undertaking replied point by point to all of the technical elements highlighted by the Court of Auditors. The
second mid-term evaluation concluded that overall, the SJU undertook the tasks assigned to it during the evaluation period (2010-2012)
effectively, thus contributing to the SESAR Programme. It is assessed that the SJU is operating according to the rules and procedures
governing it.
As regards the activities of the Joint Undertaking in 2013, the report refers to the Annual Activity Report 2013 which can be found at
http://www.sesarju.eu/.
It should be noted that the budget of the Joint Undertaking for 2013 amounted to EUR 84 141 537 in commitment appropriations and EUR
105 486 020 in payment appropriations.

2014/2130(DEC) - 31/03/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Anders Primdahl VISTISEN (ECR, DK) on discharge in respect of the
implementation of the budget of the SESAR Joint Undertaking for the financial year 2013.
It called on the European Parliament to grant the Executive Director of SESAR Joint Undertaking discharge in respect of the implementation of
the Joint Undertakings budget for the financial year 2013.

Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of SESAR for the financial year
2013 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Members called on the Parliament to approve the closure of
SESARs accounts. They made, however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is granted,
in addition to the general recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU
agencies.
·

Budgetary and financial management: Members observed that that the Joint Undertaking's final budget for the financial year 2013
included commitment appropriations of EUR 64 300 000 and payment appropriations of EUR 105 400 000, with utilisation rates for
commitment and payment appropriations at 99.6 % and 94.7 % respectively. They stressed that 100 % of the Union and Eurocontrol
contributions payable to the other 15 members under the third Multilateral Framework Agreement (MFA) of EUR 595 million had
been committed. They also remarked that 55 % of that amount, equalling EUR 316 million, had been paid out until 31 December
2013 while the remaining 45 % (EUR 279 million) was expected to be paid by 31 December 2016 . Members noted that the number
of projects would be reduced to 250 through mergers of current projects, with the allocation of EUR 38 million to the funding of new
operational activities. They called on the Joint Undertaking to submit a report to the discharge authority concerning the contributions
of all members other than the Commission, including the application of the evaluation rules for in-kind contributions, together with an
assessment by the Commission.

·

Conflicts of interests: the committee emphasised that the Joint Undertaking had put specific measures in place in order to prevent
conflicts of interest with respect to its three key stakeholders: Administrative Board members, employees and experts.

Other observations: the committee made a series of observations on the legal framework of the Joint Undertaking, and SESARs internal
controls.
It believed that links between the Joint Undertaking and the Clean Sky Joint Undertaking should be strengthened. It invited the Commission to
work with both joint undertakings in order to improve communication and reinforce synergies and complementarities, ensuring at the same
time that there is no risk of overlapping.
Members acknowledged that SESAR disseminated research foreground by making available detailed information on deliverables and their
processes to the relevant stakeholders on its extranet, as well as by publishing general details of 2013 deliverables in its 2013 annual activity
report.
They called on the Joint Undertaking to submit a report to the discharge authority on the social-economic benefits of the projects already
completed and for that report to be submitted to the discharge authority.
Lastly, Members recalled that Parliament had asked the Court to draw up a special report on the capacity of the joint undertakings, together
with their private partners, to ensure added value and efficient execution of Union research, technological development and demonstration
programmes.
