2014/0308(CNS) - 29/10/2014 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to authorise France to apply exemptions or reductions to the dock dues tax for certain products produced locally in the French
outermost regions of Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique, Mayotte and Réunion.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to
follow its opinion.
BACKGROUND: in principle, the provisions of the Treaty, which apply to the outermost regions of the Union, of which the French overseas
departments (DOM) form part, do not authorise any difference in taxation between local products and those from metropolitan France or the
other Member States. However, Article 349 of the treaty envisages the possibility of introducing special measures for those regions because of
the existence of permanent handicaps affecting the economic and social situation of the outermost regions.

The 'dock dues' tax is an indirect tax applied to deliveries and exports of goods in the French outermost regions. In principle, it is applied in the
same way to products produced locally and those that are not (products of metropolitan France, other Member States or non-member
countries).
Council Decision 2004/162/EC authorises France, until 31 December 2014, in order to restore the competitiveness of products produced
locally, to apply exemptions or reductions to the dock dues for certain products produced in the outermost regions of Guadeloupe, French
Guiana, Martinique, Réunion and, from 1 January 2014, Mayotte (excluding Saint Martin).
France has requested that a system similar to that contained in Decision 2004/162/EC be maintained until 1 January 2015.
CONTENT: the proposal for a Council Decision provides for authorising France, until 31 December 2020, to apply exemptions or reductions to
the dock dues for certain products produced in the French outermost regions (excluding Saint Martin).
The Annex to that Decision contains the list of products to which tax exemptions and reductions may be applied. The difference between the
taxation of locally manufactured products and the taxation of other products may not exceed 10, 20 or 30 percentage points, depending on the
product.
In order to simplify the obligations of small enterprises, tax exemptions or reductions will affect all operators with an annual turnover of at least
EUR 300 000. Operators whose annual turnover is under that threshold are not subject to dock dues.
The proposal envisages extending the period of application of Decision 2004/162/EC for a further six months to 30 June 2015 . This measure
will give France the necessary time to transpose the provisions of the new Council Decision into its national law.
Lastly, the new arrangement will apply for five years and six months. It will nevertheless be necessary to evaluate its results. The French
authorities must therefore present a report to the Commission by 31 December 2017 on the application of the tax arrangements introduced , in
order to assess the impact of the measures taken and their contribution to promoting or maintaining local economic activities and ascertaining
whether the tax benefits granted by France to products produced locally are still necessary and proportional.

2014/0308(CNS) - 05/12/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Regional Development adopted, in the framework of a special legislative procedure (Parliaments consultation), the report
by Iskra MIHAYLOVA (ADLE, BG) on the proposal for a Council decision concerning the dock dues in the French outermost regions.
It recommended the European Parliament to approve, unamended, the Commission proposal.
The proposal seeks to continue support for competitiveness and social and economic development. The purpose of the proposal is to establish
a new legal framework for the dock dues from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2020, by determining the products to which tax exemptions
and reductions may be applied.
The proposal also foresees extending Decision 2004/162/EC by a further six months (until 30 June 2015) in order to give France time to
transpose the provisions of the new Council Decision into its national law for the period from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2020.

2014/0308(CNS) - 16/12/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 594 votes to 99, with 10 abstentions, in the framework of a special legislative procedure (Parliaments
consultation), a legislative resolution on the proposal for a Council decision concerning the dock dues in the French outermost regions.
Parliament adopted its position without making amendments.
The proposed Decision aims to authorise France, until 31 December 2020, to apply exemptions or reductions to the dock dues for certain
products produced in the outermost regions of Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique, Réunion (excluding Saint Martin).
The 'dock dues' tax is an indirect tax applied to deliveries and exports of goods in the French outermost regions. In principle, it is applied in the
same way to products produced locally and those that are not (products of metropolitan France, other Member States or non-member
countries).

2014/0308(CNS) - 17/12/2014 Final act
PURPOSE: to establish a legal framework for dock dues from 1st January 2015.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Council Decision 940/2014/EU concerning the dock dues in the French outermost regions.
CONTENT: this Decision authorises France to apply, from 31 December 2020, to apply exemptions or reductions to the dock dues for certain
products produced in the outermost regions of Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique, Mayotte and Réunion (except for Saint Martin). Those
exemptions or reductions must be in keeping with the economic and social development strategy of the outermost regions concerned and
contribute to the promotion of local activities while not adversely affecting the conditions of trade to an extent contrary to the common interest.
The "dock dues" tax is an indirect tax that applies to supplies and imports of goods in the French outermost regions. In principle it applies in
the same way to locally manufactured products and those which are not (products of metropolitan France, the other Member States or third
countries).
The Annex to that Decision contains the list of products to which the tax exemptions or reductions may be applied. The difference between the
taxation of products produced locally and that of other products may not exceed 10, 20 or 30 percentage points, depending on the product.
Tax exemptions or reductions should affect all operators whose annual turnover is at least EUR 300 000. Operators whose annual turnover is
under that threshold should not be subject to dock dues.

France should present, by 31 December 2017, a report on the application of the taxation arrangements introduced, in order to check the
impact of the measures taken and their contribution to the maintenance, promotion and development of local economic activities, in the light of
the handicaps affecting the outermost regions.
The Decision extends by a further six months until 30 June 2015 the period of application of Decision 2004/162/EC which authorises France,
in order to restore the competitiveness of products produced locally, to apply exemptions or reductions to the dock dues for certain products
produced in its outermost regions.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: the measures shall apply from 01.07.2015.
