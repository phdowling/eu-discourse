PURPOSE: to conclude a Protocol amending the Euro-Mediterranean Aviation Agreement between the European Union and its Member
States, of the one part, and the government of the State of Israel, of the other part, to take account of the accession to the European Union of
the Republic of Croatia.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent.
CONTEXT: the Euro-Mediterranean Aviation Agreement between the European Union, its Member States and the State of Israel was
negotiated on the basis of the Council Decision adopted in April 2008 authorising the opening of negotiations. The Agreement was signed on
10 June 2013.
The Republic of Croatia acceded to the European Union on 1 July 2013.
Pursuant to Article 6(2) of the Act concerning the Conditions of Accession, Croatia undertook to accede to the agreements concluded or
signed by the Member States and the Union with one or more third counties or an international organisation.
A protocol had been negotiated, containing the necessary linguistic adaptations of the Agreement that ensue from the accession of Croatia.

The Protocol should be approved in the name of the EU.
CONTENT: with the present proposal, the Council is invited to approve in the name of the EU and its Member States, the Protocol amending
the Euro-Mediterranean Aviation Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and the government of the
State of Israel, of the other part, to take account of the accession to the European Union of the Republic of Croatia.
The Protocol only ensures the necessary amendment to be made to the Euro-Mediterranean Aviation Agreement between the European
Union, its Member States and the State of Israel following the accession of Croatia to the EU on 1 July 2013.

2014/0187(NLE) - 05/09/2014 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude a Protocol amending the Euro-Mediterranean Aviation Agreement between the European Union and its Member
States, of the one part, and Israel, of the other part, to take account of the accession to the European Union of the Republic of Croatia.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: in accordance with a Council Decision, the Protocol amending the Euro-Mediterranean Aviation Agreement between the
European Union and its Member States, of the one part and Israel, of the other part, to take account of the accession to the European Union of
Croatia has been signed, subject to its conclusion.
It is now necessary to approve the Protocol on behalf of the EU.
CONTENT: under this proposed Decision, the Council is called upon to approve, on behalf of the EU and its Member States, the Protocol
amending the Euro-Mediterranean Aviation Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and Israel, of the
other part, to take account of the accession to the European Union of the Republic of Croatia.
The protocol only provides for the necessary amendments to the Euro-Mediterranean agreement on air services between the EU, its Member

2014/0187(NLE) - 11/04/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Transport and Tourism adopted the report by Francisco ASSIS (S&D, PT) on the draft Council decision on conclusion, on
behalf of the Union and its Member States, of a Protocol amending the Euro-Mediterranean Aviation Agreement between the European Union
and its Member States, of the one part and the government of the State of Israel, of the other part, to take account of the accession to the
European Union of the Republic of Croatia.
The parliamentary committee recommended that the European Parliament approve the conclusion of the agreement.
In the short justification accompanying the report, it was recalled that the Euro-Mediterranean Aviation Agreement between the European
Union, its Member States and the State of Israel was negotiated on the basis of the Council Decision adopted in April 2008 authorising the
opening of negotiations. The Agreement was signed on 10 June 2013. The Agreement with Israel, a key aviation partner in the Mediterranean
region, is an important achievement in the process of establishing a Common Aviation Area between the EU and its Southern and Eastern
neighbours. It forms part of the Union's external aviation policy framework established by the Commission.
In accordance with the Act of Accession of the Republic of Croatia, Croatia will accede to the agreements concluded or signed before the
accession of Croatia by the EU Member States and the Union with one or more third countries by means of a protocol to those agreements.
The Protocol to take account of the accession to the European Union of the Republic of Croatia has been negotiated between the Commission
and the Israeli Authorities.
The purpose of the Protocol is to allow the Republic of Croatia to become a Party to the Euro-Mediterranean Aviation Agreement between the
European Union, its Member States and the State of Israel and to provide for the necessary ensuing linguistic adaptations. The Protocol,
which was signed on 19 February 2015, will not introduce any changes to the substance of the Euro-Mediterranean Aviation Agreement.

2014/0187(NLE) - 28/04/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 569 votes to 30, with 24 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the draft Council decision on conclusion,
on behalf of the Union and its Member States, of a Protocol amending the Euro-Mediterranean Aviation Agreement between the European
Union and its Member States, of the one part and the government of the State of Israel, of the other part, to take account of the accession to
the European Union of the Republic of Croatia.
In line with the recommendation made by the Committee on Transport and Tourism, Parliament gave its consent to the conclusion of the
protocol.
The purpose of the protocol is to allow Croatia to become a Party to the Euro-Mediterranean Aviation Agreement between the European
Union, its Member States and the State of Israel and to provide for the necessary ensuing linguistic adaptations. The Protocol, which was
signed on 19 February 2015, will not introduce any changes to the substance of the Euro-Mediterranean Aviation Agreement.
