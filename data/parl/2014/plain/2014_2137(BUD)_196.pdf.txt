2014/2137(BUD) - 14/10/2014 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: to mobilise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) to assist Finland in dealing with redundancies in its shipbuilding
sector.
PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
CONTENT: Article 12 of Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 laying down the multiannual financial framework for the years
2014-2020 provides that the EGF shall not exceed a maximum annual amount of EUR 150 million (2011 prices).
The rules applicable to financial contributions from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) are laid down in Regulation (EU) No
1309/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (2014-2020) and repealing
Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 (the 'EGF Regulation').
The Commission examined the application for mobilisation of the EGF to assist Finland and concluded the following:
Finland: EGF/2014/008 FI/STX Rauma: the Finnish authorities submitted application EGF/2014/008 FI/STX Rauma for a financial contribution
from the EGF, following redundancies in STX Finland Oy in Rauma in Finland.
The Finnish authorities submitted its application on 27 May 2014, within 12 weeks of the date on which the intervention criteria were met. The
deadline which the Commission has to finalise its assessment of the application's compliance with the conditions for providing a financial
contribution, expires on 14 October 2014.
In order to establish the link between the redundancies and major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation, Finland
argues that the global maritime industry changed dramatically in recent years. Resulting from the explosive growth of the order book in the
period 2002 to 2008, new shipyards were built, most of them in Asia. However, the global economic and financial crisis meant that the order
book was halved between 2007 and 2013. As a result of the reduced orders and the significant expansion by Asia in the shipbuilding market,
the sector is currently suffering from global overcapacity leading to tough competition.

As part of this trend, the EU market share has plummeted. Measured by production volume, the EU market share in shipbuilding was 5 % in
the first three quarters of 2013, down from 13 % in 2007. The equivalent share of China, South Korea and Japan combined was 86 % in the
first three quarters of 2013, while in 2007 this same share had been 77 %.
In many Asian countries, the shipyard industry has become an instrument for creating national employment and earning foreign currency.
Europe, the birthplace of the modern shipbuilding industry, has thus to a great extent lost out to Asian countries with low labour costs.
To date, the shipbuilding sector in broad terms has been the subject of 6 EGF applications 7, with one based on trade related globalisation
and the other five on the global financial and economic crisis.
Background to the Finnish request: the Finnish authorities submitted the application under the intervention criteria of Article 4(1)(a) of the EGF
Regulation, which requires at least 500 workers being made redundant or self-employed persons' activity ceasing, over a reference period of
four months in an enterprise in a Member State, including workers made redundant by suppliers and downstream producers and / or
self-employed persons whose activity has ceased.
The reference period of four months runs from 7 November 2013 to 7 March 2014.
The application relates to 634 workers made redundant in STX Finland Oy, most of them at its shipyard located in Rauma, but some spillover
also affecting its bigger Turku facility. STX Finland Oy operates in the economic sector classified under NACE Rev. 2 division 30 ('Manufacture
of other transport equipment'). The redundancies made by the enterprise concerned are mainly located in the NUTS level 2 region of West
Finland (FI19).
The application relates to 577 workers made redundant5 in STX Finland Oy during the reference period. The conditions for awarding a
financial contribution from the EGF are met.
In view of the Finnish request, it is proposed to mobilise the EGF for the amount of EUR 1 426 800 to make a contribution to the package of
personalised services.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: having examined the application in respect of the conditions set out in Article 13(1) of the EGF Regulation, and
having taken into account the number of targeted beneficiaries, the proposed actions and the estimated costs, the Commission proposes to
mobilise the EGF for the amount of EUR 1 426 800, representing 60 % of the total costs of the proposed actions, in order to provide a financial
contribution for the application.
The proposed decision to mobilise the EGF will be taken jointly by the European Parliament and the Council, as laid down in point 13 of the
Interinstitutional Agreement of 2 December 2013 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline,
on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management.
At the same time as it presents this proposal for a decision to mobilise the EGF, the Commission will present to the European Parliament and
to the Council a proposal for a transfer to the relevant budgetary line for the requested amount.
When the Commission adopts this proposal for a decision to mobilise the EGF, it will also adopt a decision on a financial contribution, by
means of an implementing act, which will enter into force on the date at which the European Parliament and the Council adopt the proposed
decision to mobilise the EGF.

2014/2137(BUD) - 21/11/2014 Budgetary report tabled for plenary, 1st reading
The Committee on Budgets adopted the report by Petri SARVAMAA (EPP, FI) on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and
of the Council on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, to the amount of EUR 1 426 800 in commitment and
payment appropriations in order to assist Finland following redundancies in the shipbuilding sector.
Members recalled that the Union set up legislative and budgetary instruments to provide additional support to workers who are suffering from
the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns and to assist their reintegration into the labour market.
Finnish application: Finland submitted application EGF/2014/008 FI/STX Rauma on 27 May 2014 following the dismissal of 577 workers in
STX Finland Oy, an enterprise which operated in the economic sector classified under NACE Rev. 2 division 30 ('Manufacture of other
transport equipment'). Members noted that the Finnish authorities submitted the application under the intervention criterion of Article 4(1)(a) of
the EGF Regulation, which requires at least 500 workers being made redundant or self-employed persons' activity ceasing, over a reference
period of four months in an enterprise in a Member State, including workers made redundant or self-employed persons' activity ceasing in its
suppliers and downstream producers. Therefore, Finland is entitled to a financial contribution under that Regulation.
Members welcomed the fact that, in order to provide workers with speedy assistance, the Finnish authorities decided to initiate the
implementation of the personalised services to the affected workers on 15 January 2014, ahead of the final decision on granting the EGF
support for the proposed coordinated package.
Nature of the redundancies: Members noted that these redundancies will further aggravate the unemployment situation in Southwest Finland,
as most of the dismissed workers have a poor standard of education in combination with relatively advanced age (41.42% of the dismissed
workers are between the age of 55 and 64 years), which is likely to increase the risk of prolonged unemployment. Members considered
therefore that these workers may have specific needs when it comes to providing them with personalised services.
Coordinated package of personalised services: Members noted that the personalised services which are to be provided consist of the following
three types of measures for the redundant workers covered by this application: (i) helping them transfer to a new job, (ii) helping them start
their own business, and (iii) providing training or education.
They welcomed the establishment of Service Points amongst the proposed actions which are expected to provide an even more personal and
in-depth service than the public employment office.
They also welcomed the idea that those planning to start a business can experience what it is like to be an entrepreneur by means of a
placement in an existing enterprise.
Lastly, they noted that the purpose of the pay subsidies is to ensure that targeted workers hired by new employers do not lose out in the first

period of their new employment. Such a measure could serve as an incentive to searching and engaging in a broader spectrum of new and
unfamiliar jobs for the workers.

2014/2137(BUD) - 25/11/2014 Budgetary text adopted by Parliament
The European Parliament adopted by 597 votes to 77, with 11 abstentions, a resolution on the proposal for a decision of the European
Parliament and of the Council on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, to the amount of EUR 1 426 800 in
commitment and payment appropriations in order to assist Finland following redundancies in the shipbuilding sector.
Parliament recalled that the Union set up legislative and budgetary instruments to provide additional support to workers who are suffering from
the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns and to assist their reintegration into the labour market.
Finnish application: Finland submitted application EGF/2014/008 FI/STX Rauma on 27 May 2014 following the dismissal of 577 workers in

Nature of the redundancies: Parliament noted that the Finnish authorities argue that the global maritime industry has changed dramatically in
recent years and that, in this global context, the EU market share in shipbuilding has plummeted whilst Asias market has expanded
significantly. Parliament noted that these redundancies will further aggravate the unemployment situation in Southwest Finland, as most of the
dismissed workers have a poor standard of education in combination with relatively advanced age (41.42% of the dismissed workers are
between the age of 55 and 64 years), which is likely to increase the risk of prolonged unemployment. It considered therefore that these

Parliament noted that the purpose of the pay subsidies is to ensure that targeted workers hired by new employers do not lose out in the first
period of their new employment. Such a measure could serve as an incentive to searching and engaging in a broader spectrum of new and
unfamiliar jobs for the workers.
Complementary measures of the EGF: lastly, Parliament called for the European Social Fund (ESF) measures planned within the new ESF
programming period to complement the measures proposed and to facilitate the worker's reintegration in future-oriented and sustainable
economic sectors.

2014/2137(BUD) - 26/11/2014 Final act
PURPOSE: to mobilise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in respect of redundancies in the shipbuilding sector in Finland.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision 2014/878/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on the mobilisation of the European
Globalisation Adjustment Fund, in accordance with point 13 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 2 December 2013 between the European
Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline, on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial
management (application EGF/2014/008 FI/STX Rauma, from Finland).
CONTENT: with this Decision, the European Parliament and the Council have decided to mobilise the EGF for an amount of EUR 1 426 800 in
commitment and payment appropriations in the framework of the 2014 general budget of the European Union.
This amount shall assist Finland following redundancies in STX Finland Oy in Rauma.
Given that this application complies with the requirements for determining the financial contributions as laid down in Regulation (EU) No
1309/2013 (MFF Regulation 2014-2020), the European Parliament and Council have decided to grant the abovementioned amount.
To recall, the EGF was established to provide support for workers made redundant and self-employed persons whose activity has ceased as a
result of major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation, as a result of a continuation of the global financial and economic
crisis addressed in Regulation (EC) No 546/2009, or as a result of a new global financial and economic crisis and to assist them with their
reintegration into the labour market.
Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 laying down the multiannual financial framework for the years 2014-2020 provides that the EGF shall
not exceed a maximum annual amount of EUR 150 million.
