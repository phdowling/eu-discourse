2014/0177(COD) - 12/06/2014 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 517/94 of 7 March 1994 on common rules for
imports of textile products from certain third countries not covered by bilateral agreements, protocols or
other arrangements, or by other specific Community import rules.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the
ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council
BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 517/946 has been substantially amended several times. It is
recalled that on 1 April 1987, the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified
after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Conclusions of the
Presidency of the Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this requirement, stressing the
importance of codification.
The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement
dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of
codification instruments.
CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and rationality, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a
codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 517/94 on common rules for imports of textile products from
certain third countries not covered by bilateral agreements, protocols or other arrangements, or by other
specific Community import rules.
The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it; fully preserving the content of
the acts being codified.
At the same time, it is also appropriate to introduce certain slight substantive amendments in Articles 4(2)
(Chapter I - General Principles), 6(4) (Chapter II - Union information and investigation procedure) and 23
(Chapter IV- Management of Union import restrictions) of that Regulation. Therefore, the proposal is being
presented in the form of a recast.
The proposal is part of an alignment exercise following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon to
ensure that the previous decision making procedures in trade policy were aligned to the new regime of
delegated and implementing acts.
Currently, the only countries the EU is importing textiles from that are not covered by bilateral agreements,
protocols or other arrangements or by other specific EU import rules including the Generalised Scheme of
Preferences and the Everything but Arms arrangement are Belarus and North Korea.
The proposed Regulation:
sets annual quantitative limits for the imports of a number of textile products from these two
countries, the management and distribution of which is done through a Commission Implementing
Regulation, and it allows for the establishment of Union surveillance and safeguard measures;
allows for the imposition of surveillance measures on other third countries where textile imports
originating in them cause or threaten to cause serious injury to EU production of like or directly
competitive products.
Given that the textile sector is a sensitive one for the EU, the proposal aims to ensure that the applicable rules are clear and user-friendly for
the operators concerned, and that they ensure legal certainty.

2014/0177(COD) - 29/01/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on International Trade adopted the report by Jaros?aw WA??SA (EPP, PL) on the proposal for a regulation of the European
Parliament and of the Council on common rules for imports of textile products from certain third countries not covered by bilateral agreements,
protocols or other arrangements, or by other specific Union import rules (recast).
The proposal is part of an alignment exercise following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon to ensure that the previous decision making
procedures in trade policy were aligned to the new regime of delegated and implementing acts.
The committee recommended that the European Parliaments position adopted at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure
should amend the Commission proposal. The amendments aim to make the proposal clearer and enhance legal certainty. They aim to:
·

stipulate that implementing acts are no longer adopted by the Council, but by the Commission following the new comitology
procedure;

·

keep in force, in its amended version, Annex VII on Outward Processing Traffic (OPT) from Council Regulation (EEC) 3030/93,

which is in the process of being repealed and transferred to the recast version as OPT is still in use;
·

transfer CN code 3005 90 31 Gauze and articles of gauze from Council Regulation (EEC) 3030/93, which is in the process of being
repealed, to Annex I.A under category 163 of the recast version. This specific product was used in the past with China and might be
used again in future.

2014/0177(COD) - 29/04/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 634 votes to 35, with 20 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council on common rules for imports of textile products from certain third countries not covered by bilateral
agreements, protocols or other arrangements, or by other specific Union import rules (recast).
Parliament adopted its position at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure. The amendments adopted in plenary amend the
Commission proposal so as to:
stipulate that implementing acts are no longer adopted by the Council, but by the Commission following the new comitology procedure;
keep in force, in its amended version, Annex VII on Outward Processing Traffic (OPT) from Council Regulation (EEC) 3030/93, which is in the
process of being repealed and transferred to the recast version as OPT is still in use; the Commission has been empowered to adopt
delegated acts in this context;
transfer CN code 3005 90 31 Gauze and articles of gauze from Council Regulation (EEC) 3030/93, which is in the process of being repealed,
to Annex I.A under category 163 of the recast version.

2014/0177(COD) - 09/06/2015 Final act
PURPOSE: to recast Council Regulation (EC) No 517/94 on common rules for imports of textile products from certain third countries not
covered by bilateral agreements, protocols or other arrangements, or by other specific Community import rules.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Regulation (EU) 2015/936 of the European Parliament and of the Council on common rules for imports of textile products
from certain third countries not covered by bilateral agreements, protocols or other arrangements, or by other specific Union import rules
(recast).
CONTENT: the Regulation aims to recast Council Regulation No 517/94 which had been substantially amended on several occasions.
The Regulation applies to imports of textile products falling within Section XI of Part Two of the Combined Nomenclature set out in Annex I to
Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 and of other textile products, as listed in Annex I to this Regulation, originating in third countries and not
covered by bilateral agreements, protocols or other arrangements, or by other specific Union import rules.
Currently, the only countries the EU is importing textiles from that are not covered by bilateral agreements, protocols or other arrangements or
by other specific EU import rules including the Generalised Scheme of Preferences and the Everything but Arms arrangement are Belarus
and North Korea.
The new Regulation:
sets annual quantitative limits for the imports of a number of textile products from these two countries, the management and
distribution of which is done through a Commission Implementing Regulation, and it allows for the establishment of Union surveillance
and safeguard measures;
allows for the imposition of surveillance measures on other third countries where textile imports originating in them cause or threaten
to cause serious injury to EU production of like or directly competitive products.
stipulates that if Union surveillance is applied, release for free circulation of the products in question should be made subject to
presentation of a surveillance document meeting uniform criteria. That document should, on simple application by the importer, be
issued by the authorities of the Member States within a certain period but without the importer thereby acquiring any right to import;
adopts precise criteria for assessing possible injury and initiating an investigations procedure while still allowing the Commission to
introduce appropriate measures in urgent cases;
lays down detailed provisions in respect of the initiation of investigations , the checks and inspections required, the hearing of those
concerned, the treatment of information obtained and the criteria for assessing injury;
provides for an appropriate system for administering Union quantitative restrictions;
in the interests of uniformity of rules for imports, ensures that the formalities to be carried out by importers are simple and identical
regardless of the place where the goods clear customs. Formalities are carried out using forms corresponding to the specimen set out
in Annex VI to this Regulation;
authorises surveillance or safeguard measures confined to one or more regions rather than the whole of the Union . However, such
measures should be authorised only exceptionally and cause the minimum of disruption to the operation of the internal market.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 15.7.2015.
DELEGATED ACT: the Commission may adopt delegated acts in respect of amending the Annexes to this Regulation, altering the import rules
and applying safeguard measures and surveillance measures in the Regulation. The power to adopt such acts is conferred on the Commission
for a period of 5 years (which may be tacitly extended) from 20 February 2014. The European Parliament or Council may raise objections with
regard to a delegated act within two months of the date of notification (which may be extended by two months). If Parliament or council raise
objections, the delegated act will not come into force.
