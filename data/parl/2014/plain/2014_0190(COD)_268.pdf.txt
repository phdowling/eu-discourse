2014/0190(COD) - 25/06/2014 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to codify Council Regulation (EC) No 140/2008 on certain procedures for applying the Stabilisation and Association Agreement
between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Montenegro, of the other part, and for applying the Interim
Agreement between the European Community, of the one part, and Montenegro, of the other part.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 140/2008 has been substantially amended. It is recalled that on 1 April 1987 the Commission
decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement.
The Conclusions of the Presidency of the December 1992 Edinburgh European Council confirmed this, stressing the importance of
codification.
The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an
accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments.
CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and rationality, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No
140/2008 of 19 November 2007 on certain procedures for applying the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European
Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Montenegro, of the other part, and for applying the Interim Agreement between the
European Community, of the one part, and Montenegro, of the other part.

The new proposed Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it; this proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being
codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise
itself.
Main provisions codified: the proposal lays down certain procedures for the adoption of detailed rules for the implementation of certain
provisions of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between
the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Montenegro, of the other part ( SAA). It stipulates
that fishery products originating in Montenegro may be imported into the Union at a reduced customs duty, within the limits of tariff quotas. It is
therefore necessary to lay down provisions regulating the management of those tariff quotas.
Tariff quotas: the proposal sets out in particular:
concessions for fish and fishery products
certain tariff reductions.
The proposal also lays down conditions as regards the safeguard clauses for agricultural and fishery products provided for in the Agreement
as well as a general safeguard clause.
The implementation of the bilateral safeguard clauses of the SAA requires uniform conditions for the adoption of safeguard and other
measures. Those measures should be adopted in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the
Council. The Commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases relating to exceptional and
critical circumstances arising, imperative grounds of urgency so require.
The proposal sets out conditions as regards the administrative cooperation to facilitate the management of the Agreement.
It should be noted that the future Regulation shall repeal Regulation (EC) No 140/2008.

2014/0190(COD) - 05/12/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Legal Affairs adopted the report by Andrzej DUDA (ECR, PL) on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament
and of the Council on certain procedures for applying the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and
their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Montenegro, of the other part (codified text).
The committee recommended the European Parliament to adopt the Commission proposal as adapted to the recommendations of the
Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
According to the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, the proposal
in question contains a straightforward codification of the existing texts without any change in their substance.

2014/0190(COD) - 11/03/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 623 votes to 60, with 18 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council on certain procedures for applying the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the
European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Montenegro, of the other part (codified text).
Parliament adopted its position at first reading in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure taking over the Commission proposal, as
adapted to the recommendations of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the
Commission.
The Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, stated that the proposal in
question contains a straightforward codification of the existing texts without any change in their substance.
The proposal seeks to lay down certain procedures for the adoption of detailed rules for the implementation of certain provisions of the
Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of
Montenegro, of the other part (SAA).
The SAA stipulates that fishery products originating in Montenegro may be imported into the Union at a reduced customs duty, within the limits
of tariff quotas. It is therefore necessary to lay down provisions regulating the management of those tariff quotas.
The acts concerned shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure.
The Commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases relating to exceptional and critical
circumstances arising within the meaning of the Regulation, imperative grounds of urgency so require.

2014/0190(COD) - 29/04/2015 Final act
PURPOSE: to codify Council Regulation (EC) No 140/2008 on certain procedures for applying the Stabilisation and Association Agreement
between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Montenegro, of the other part, and for applying the Interim
Agreement between the European Community, of the one part, and Montenegro, of the other part.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Regulation (EU) 2015/752 of the European Parliament and of the Council on certain procedures for applying the
Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of
Montenegro, of the other part.

CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and rationality, the Regulation undertook a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 140/2008 on
certain procedures for applying the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of
the one part, and Montenegro, of the other part, and for applying the Interim Agreement between the European Community, of the one part,
and Montenegro, of the other part.

the other part (SAA). It stipulates that fishery products originating in Montenegro may be imported into the Union at a reduced customs duty,
within the limits of tariff quotas. It is therefore necessary to lay down provisions regulating the management of those tariff quotas.
Tariff quotas: the Regulation sets out in particular:
concessions for fish and fishery products
certain tariff reductions.
Trade defence: the Regulation also lays down conditions as regards the safeguard clauses for agricultural and fishery products provided for in
the Agreement as well as a general safeguard clause.
The implementation of the bilateral safeguard clauses of the SAA requires uniform conditions for the adoption of safeguard and other
measures. Those measures should be adopted in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the
Council. The Commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases relating to exceptional and
critical circumstances arising, imperative grounds of urgency so require.
The Regulation sets out conditions as regards the administrative cooperation to facilitate the management of the Agreement.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 8.6.2015. Regulation (EC) No 140/2008 is repealed.
