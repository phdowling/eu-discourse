2014/2149(INI) - 22/07/2014 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: presentation of a Communication proposing an integrated approach to cultural heritage for Europe.
BACKGROUND: cultural heritage is a shared resource, and a common good. It can be vulnerable to over-exploitation and under-funding,
which can result in neglect, decay and, in some cases, oblivion.
It is, therefore, our common responsibility, while heritage protection is primarily a matter for national, regional and local authorities. The
European Union has no less a role to play in line with the EU Treaties and in respect of the principle of subsidiarity.
This is why the Commission proposes this Communication, which has been informed by several years of dialogue with EU Presidencies and
stakeholders, responding to the invitation of the Council to "pursue the analysis of the economic and social impact of cultural heritage in the
EU and contribute to a development of a strategic approach".

The overall objective is to examine available information on the economic and social impacts of cultural heritage, as well as plans to improve
the evidence base and to explore the challenges and opportunities for the heritage sector.
The communication sets out the tools available at EU level, complementing national and regional programmes, to help protect and enhance
the intrinsic and social value of heritage, to strengthen its contribution to economic growth and job creation, and develop its potential for the
EU's public diplomacy.
CONTENT: the European experience shows that it is possible to progress from an appreciation of the uniqueness of one's own heritage to an
interest in and respect for the heritage of others. In this context, the Communication describes the measures available to strengthen policy
cooperation at different levels, and projects being developed to support new models of heritage governance.
The overall aim is to help Member States and stakeholders make the most of the significant support for heritage available under EU
instruments, progress towards a more integrated approach at national and EU level, and ultimately make Europe a laboratory for
heritage-based innovation.
Economic base of cultural heritage: according to the most recent statistics (France, 2011), heritage generated EUR 8.1 billion and UK studies
have shown that the historic environment can offer a high return on investment: each £1 invested generating up to £1.60 of additional
economic activity over ten years. In the area of tourism, heritage is estimated to contribute EUR 415 billion to the EU GDP and 3.4 million
tourism enterprises account for 15.2 million jobs many linked to heritage, directly or indirectly. In 2013, 52% of EU citizens visited at least one
historical monument or site and 37% a museum or gallery in their respective countries, while 19% visited a historical monument or site in
another EU country.
Heritage, therefore, has great capacity to promote social cohesion and integration, through regeneration of neglected areas, creation of
locally-rooted jobs, and promotion of shared understanding and a sense of community.
However, to increase understanding of the actual and potential role of heritage in policy development, it is important to improve systematic
data on its economic and social impacts.
Towards an integrated approach to cultural heritage: to strengthen Europe's position in the field of cultural heritage preservation, restoration
and valorisation, the Commission proposes to:
·

encourage the modernisation of the heritage sector by actions raising awareness and engaging new audiences;

·

apply a strategic approach to research and innovation, knowledge sharing and smart specialization;

·

seize the opportunities offered by digitisation; to reach out to new audiences and engage young people in particular;

·

identify skills needs and improve the training of heritage professionals; and

·

continue developing more participative interpretation and governance models that are better suited to contemporary Europe, through
greater involvement of the private sector and civil society.

To achieve these objectives, several actions are envisaged including actions relating to:
Research and innovation: pooling resources in order to apply the latest technologies and stimulate new scientific approaches can greatly
improve the understanding, preservation and dissemination of cultural heritage. To this end, the Horizon 2020 programme for research and
innovation (with nearly EUR 80 billion available from 2014 to 2020) will further reinforce the EU's position in the field of cultural heritage
preservation, restoration and valorisation.
Digitisation: the digitisation of heritage contributes to the European Agenda for Culture, by improving public access to different forms of cultural
and linguistic expressions. The Europeana cultural platform (www.europeana.eu) now provides access to some 30 million cultural objects from
more than 2,500 organisations. However, much remains to do to rare and old material, including film. Initiatives are proposed within the
framework of a parallel communication on the digitisation of cinematographic works.
Raising awareness: the new programme "Creative Europe" will support cross-border cooperation to promote the modernisation of the heritage
sector. It will also improve civil society capacity to operate transnationally by supporting networks and platforms. Other initiatives will contribute
to the awareness of common European heritage such as the "European Capitals of Cultural" (ECC), the European Heritage Label, or even the
programme "Europe for Citizens" which seeks to encourage reflection on the causes of totalitarian regimes in modern European history.
Local and regional development and cultural heritage: the EU's cohesion and rural development policies can be instrumental in promoting the
restoration of cultural heritage, supporting cultural and creative industries and financing the training and upgrading of skills of cultural
professionals. Conserving, promoting and managing cultural heritage is currently well supported under the EU Structural and Investment
Funds (ESIF). In 2007-2013, the European Regional Development Fund allocated EUR 3.2 billion for protecting and preserving cultural
heritage, EUR 2.2 billion to develop cultural infrastructure and EUR 553 million for cultural services, which also benefited cultural heritage.
Cultural heritage will remain eligible, under certain conditions, to benefit from ESIF investments in heritage in 2014-2020.
Promoting tourism and strengthening training: the EU provides grants for the creation or improvement of European cultural routes crossing
several countries and joining them in a common narrative. The Commission also intends reviving old skills and developing new ones. To
achieve this, it aims to increase the attractiveness of heritage-related professions and to provide more opportunities for continuous training,
taking advantage, for instance, of the opportunities provided by the European Social Fund.
In addition, building on the achievements of the Lifelong Learning Programme, the Erasmus+programme will provide increased opportunities
for learning mobility and tackle skills gaps by supporting transnational partnerships between entreprises.
Strengthening the cooperation in external relations: the EU and its Member States are active in multilateral fora and organisations that address
cultural heritage policies, such as the Council of Europe and UNESCO.
Initiatives are also planned to fight against illicit trafficking (notably in Africa) as well as to strengthen the policy dialogues that the Commission
conducts with the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM), China, India, Brazil, and the European Neighbourhood Policy countries.
Strengthening cultural governance: cooperation at EU level can and does make a decisive contribution towards heritage policies and
governance at national and local levels. Legislative action has already been taken in areas of EU competence. In addition, the recent revision

of the Environmental Impact Assessment (Directive 2014/52/EU) strengthens the requirement for Member States to assess the effects of
certain public and private projects on material assets and cultural heritage.
The next Council Work Plan for Culture starting in 2015 offers the opportunity to step up cooperation between the Member States within the
Open Method of Coordination (OMC).
Heritage will also feature in the Commission's structured dialogue with civil society (for example: within the framework of the European Expert
Network on Culture).
Next steps: the Commission now invites all stakeholders to jointly look into how public policies at all levels, including the EU, could better be
marshalled to draw out the long term and sustainability value of Europe's cultural heritage, and develop a more integrated approach to its
preservation and valorisation.

2014/2149(INI) - 24/06/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Culture and Education adopted an own-initiative report by Mircea DIACONU (ADLE, RO) entitled Towards an integrated
approach to cultural heritage for Europe.
Members recalled that culture and cultural heritage are shared resources and are common goods and values that cannot be subject to an
exclusive use, and their full potential for sustainable human, social and economic development has yet to be fully recognised and properly
exploited, both at the level of EU strategies and the UN post-2015 development goals.
The report considered that an integrated approach is necessary if one wishes to achieve cultural dialogue and mutual understanding. In this
context, Members addressed the recommendations to the Commission:
to establish a common approach within the Commission through improved cooperation between the different policy areas dealing with
cultural heritage, and to report back to Parliament on the results of this closer cooperation;
to communicate to potential beneficiaries, in a straightforward and accessible way such as through a single information platform and
exchange of best practices in the EU, concerning the existing European funding lines for cultural heritage;
to designate, preferably for 2018, a European Year of Cultural Heritage, with an adequate budget and to submit the draft programme
for the European Year to Parliament no later than 2016;
to acknowledge, within its political and transversal approach, cultural heritage as both movable and immovable, tangible and
intangible, and as a non-renewable resource whose authenticity must be preserved.
European funding: in addition to setting up a single EU portal dedicated to tangible and intangible cultural heritage, the report called on the
Commission to:
support, with dedicated funding, studies, research and pilot measures specifically designed to analyse the impacts of cultural heritage
promotion processes;
strengthen the newly established principle of multifunding, which allows the complementary use of different European funds within the
same large-scale project;
review the EUR 5 million benchmark in relation to cultural heritage projects submitted in the framework of the small-scale
infrastructure action1, bringing it to at least the same level as UNESCO projects, i.e. EUR 10 million.
Member States are invited to look into possible fiscal incentives in relation to restoration, preservation and conservation work, such as
reductions in VAT or other taxes, given that European cultural heritage is also managed by private bodies.
New governance models: the report asked the Member States to ensure the development of legal tools that allow alternative funding and
administration models, such as community involvement, the participation of civil society and public-private partnerships , with a view to
implementing actions related to cultural heritage (conservation, restoration, preservation, development and promotion).
Members proposed initiating a Europe-wide dialogue between policymakers across all levels of governance, together with cultural and creative
industries, networks of tourism operators, partnerships between private and public actors, and NGOs.
Stressing the importance of cross-border cultural projects, Members called for measures to be taken to strengthen and expand support for
funding through public-private partnership agreements.
Moreover, they stressed the need for new governance models to include a system of quality control in all alternative forms of funding and
administration of cultural heritage.
The economic and strategic potential of cultural heritage: the report noted that cultural heritage contributes to innovative jobs, products,
services and processes and that it plays a vital role in several of the Europe 2020 flagship initiatives, such as the Digital Agenda, the
Innovation Union, the Agenda for New Skills and Jobs and the industrial policy for the globalisation era.
Therefore, Members called for greater recognition of the role of European cultural heritage as a strategic resource for smart, sustainable, and
inclusive growth in the mid-term review of the Europe 2020 strategy.
The report pointed out that cultural tourism, which accounts for 40 % of European tourism, is a key economic sector in terms of potential for
growth and employment. It underlined the possibility of focusing more strongly on cultural tourism in developing macro-regional strategies
designed to make it a more integral part of the strategic framework for European cooperation.
Members recalled the importance of promoting the conservation of cultural heritage assets and encouraging all forms of sustainable tourism.
Members insisted on the need to:
give cultural heritage its clear place in the Commissions Investment Plan for Europe;
promote excellence, innovation and competitiveness in the cultural and creative sectors by supporting the work of artists, creators and
cultural professionals;
propose a set of indicators that could be used for monitoring and evaluation of the situation of cultural heritage and that would be

uniform for all Member States;
develop and promote opportunities for mobility and exchange of experiences for those working in the cultural heritage sector, by
ensuring that there is genuine professional reciprocity;
promoting in school curricula the inclusion of art, music, theatre and film education as a key to developing knowledge of cultural
heritage.
Opportunities and challenges: overall, Members encouraged the creation of all-round tourist products based on an integrated
development/strategy plan in order to enhance the visibility of the cultural heritage. The report also insisted, inter alia, on:
the need to improve the level of digitisation, preservation and online availability of cultural heritage, in particular the European film
heritage;
the importance of developing a true democratic and participative narrative for European heritage, including that of religious and ethnic
minorities. Religious heritage constitutes an intangible part of European cultural heritage, regardless of its religious origins;
the importance of intercultural dialogue both within and outside Europe. The Union should promote such dialogue as an appropriate
tool against radicalism of whatever origin;
supporting cultural activities of migrant communities;
improving accessibility to cultural heritage sites for people with disabilities;
the importance of the gastronomic heritage, which must be protected and supported;
strengthening efforts to fight the stealing, smuggling and illegal trafficking of cultural heritage assets inside and outside the EU;
the importance of protecting and conserving cultural heritage, not only from the ravages of time but also from hooliganism and
despoliation.
Lastly, Members encouraged the adoption of international agreements to prevent illicit trafficking of cultural heritage. In this regard, the EU,
together with the UN and UNESCO, should defend heritage in danger and fight looting and destruction of cultural objects in conflict areas.

2014/2149(INI) - 08/09/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 613 votes to 70 with 19 abstentions, a resolution entitled Towards an integrated approach to cultural
heritage for Europe.
Members recalled that culture and cultural heritage are shared resources and are common goods and values that cannot be subject to an

Commission to:
support, with dedicated funding, studies, research and pilot measures specifically designed to: (i) analyse the impacts of cultural
heritage promotion processes; (ii) develop specific indicators and benchmarks in relation to the direct and indirect contribution of that
heritage to economic and social development processes, and (iii) directly support cultural and social innovation integrated into local
settings in which cultural heritage can drive development and help improve peoples quality of life;
strengthen the newly established principle of multifunding, which allows the complementary use of different European funds within the
same large-scale project;
review the EUR 5 million benchmark in relation to cultural heritage projects submitted in the framework of the small-scale

stock of best practices in fiscal policies in Europe and recommend the appropriate ones to the Member States.
Stressing the importance of cross-border cultural projects, Members called for measures to be taken to strengthen and expand support for
funding through public-private partnership agreements.
Moreover, they stressed the need for new governance models to include a system of quality control in all alternative forms of funding and

Members recalled the importance of promoting the conservation of cultural heritage assets and encouraging all forms of sustainable tourism by
shaping sustainable, less invasive and higher value-added forms of cultural and natural tourism,
Members insisted on the need to:
give cultural heritage its clear place in the Commissions Investment Plan for Europe and to ensure that adequate funds and
initiatives are directed to the valorisation of Europes cultural heritage;
promote excellence, innovation and competitiveness in the cultural and creative sectors by supporting the work of artists, creators and
