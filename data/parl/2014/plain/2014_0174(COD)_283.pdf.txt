2014/0174(COD) - 10/06/2014 Initial legislative proposal
PURPOSE: codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 3286/94 of 22 December 1994 laying down Community procedures in the field of the
common commercial policy in order to ensure the exercise of the Community's rights under international trade rules, in particular those
established under the auspices of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and rationality, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No
3286/94 laying down Community procedures in the field of the common commercial policy in order to ensure the exercise of the Community's
rights under international trade rules, in particular those established under the auspices of the World Trade Organization.
Council Regulation (EC) No 3286/946 has been substantially amended several times. It is recalled that on 1 April 1987, the Commission
decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement.
The Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this requirement, stressing the importance of codification.
The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an
accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments.
The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it; this proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and

hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself.

2014/0174(COD) - 03/03/2015 Legislative proposal
The Commission has proposed to amend its proposal to codify Council Regulation (EC) No 3286/94, having regard to the amendments which
have been made since its initial proposal dated from 10 June 2014.
As regards decision-making procedures, the proposal states that where the Union, as a result of a complaint on behalf of the Union industry or
a complaint on behalf of Union enterprises or a request by a Member States, follows formal international consultation or dispute settlement
procedures, decisions relating to the initiation, conduct or termination of such procedures shall be taken by the Commission.
The Commission shall inform the Member States where it decides to initiate, conduct or terminate formal international consultations or dispute
settlement procedures.
Compared to the initial proposal, the changes made now stipulate that where the Union, having acted in accordance with Article 13(2), has to
take a decision on the measures of commercial policy to be adopted pursuant to the third subparagraph of Article 12(2) or pursuant to Article
13, it shall act, without delay, in accordance with Article 207 of the Treaty and, as appropriate, Regulation (EU) No 654/2014 of the European
Parliament and of the Council or any other applicable procedures.

2014/0174(COD) - 22/06/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Legal Affairs adopted the report by Ji?í MATÁLKA (GUE/NGL, CZ) on the amended proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council laying down Union procedures in the field of the common commercial policy in order to ensure the
exercise of the Unions rights under international trade rules, in particular those established under the auspices of the World Trade
Organization (codified text).
The committee recommended the European Parliament to adopt its position at first reading taking over the Commission proposal as adapted
to the recommendations of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
According to the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, the proposal
in question contains a straightforward codification of the existing texts without any change in their substance.

2014/0174(COD) - 07/07/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 633 votes to 58, with 14 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the amended proposal for a regulation of
the European Parliament and of the Council laying down Union procedures in the field of the common commercial policy in order to ensure the
exercise of the Unions rights under international trade rules, in particular those established under the auspices of the World Trade
Organization (codified text).
Parliament adopted its position at first reading taking over the Commission proposal.
The Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission concluded that the
proposal in question contains a straightforward codification of the existing texts without any change in their substance.
The codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 3286/94 lays down Community procedures in the field of the common commercial policy in
order to ensure the exercise of the Community's rights under international trade rules, in particular those established under the auspices of the
World Trade Organization (WTO) which, subject to compliance with existing international obligations and procedures, aim to:
respond to obstacles to trade that have an effect on the market of the Union, with a view to removing the injury resulting therefrom;
respond to obstacles to trade that have an effect on the market of a third country, with a view to removing the adverse trade effects
resulting therefrom.
The Union procedures rules should be based on a legal mechanism under Union law which is fully transparent, and ensures that the decision
to invoke the Unions rights under international trade rules is taken on the basis of accurate factual information and legal analysis.
Such a mechanism should aim to provide procedural means for requesting that the Union institutions react to obstacles to trade that are
adopted or maintained by third countries and which cause injury or otherwise adverse trade effects, provided that a right of action exists, in
respect of such obstacles, under applicable international trade rules.
In acting pursuant to this Regulation, the Union has to bear in mind the need for rapid and effective action through the application of the
decision-making procedures provided for in this Regulation. It is incumbent on the Commission to act in respect of obstacles to trade that are
adopted or maintained by third countries, within the framework of the Unions international rights and obligations, only when the interests of the
Union call for intervention. When assessing such interests, the Commission should give due consideration to the views of all interested parties
in the proceedings.
The European Parliament and the Council should be kept informed of the developments under this Regulation, in order to enable them to
consider their broader policy implications.

the examination procedure;
stipulates that Commission should act in respect of obstacles to trade that are adopted or maintained by third countries, within the
