2014/0334(COD) - 21/11/2014 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to repeal Council Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 on common rules for imports of certain textile products from third countries.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 on common rules for imports of certain textile products from third countries applies to
imports of textile products originating in third countries, with which the European Community has concluded bilateral agreements, signed
protocols or made other arrangements.
In recent years, the European Union only maintained bilateral agreements on trade in textiles with Russia and Serbia. After Russia's accession
to the WTO and the entry into force of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia, Council Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 lost its
main purpose.
Moreover, Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 was used to impose quantitative limits to certain textiles products originating from the People's
Republic of China during a limited period and to eventually use the transitional product-specific safeguard mechanism for China. This
mechanism expired on 11 December 2013.
Therefore, it is necessary to repeal this Regulation.
CONTENT: this proposal foresees the repeal Council Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 in order to promote legal certainty.

The parliamentary committee recommended that the European Parliament adopts its position at first reading, following the ordinary legislative
procedure, taking over the Commission proposal.

to the WTO and the entry into force of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia, Council Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 lost its
main purpose and therefore, it is necessary to repeal this Regulation.

2014/0334(COD) - 29/04/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 679 votes to 9, with 8 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation of the

European Union had a bilateral agreement on trade in textiles.
After Russia's accession to the WTO, and the entry into force, on 1 September 2013, of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with
