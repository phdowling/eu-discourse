Summary

2014/2699(RSP) - 17/04/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 437 to 49 and 85 votes, a resolution on Russian pressure on Eastern Partnership countries and in
particular destabilisation of eastern Ukraine.
The text adopted in plenary had been tabled as a joint resolution by the EPP, ALDE, Greens/EFA and ECR groups.
Members condemned in the strongest possible terms the escalating destabilisation and provocations in eastern and southern Ukraine and
reject any preparation for illegal Crimea-like referendums. They urge Russia to immediately withdraw its support of violent separatists and
armed militias who have seized government buildings in Slovyansk, Donetsk and other cities and express their support for the Ukranian
government. They strongly warn Russia against using Ukraines legitimate right to defend its territorial integrity as a pretext to launch a
full-scale military invasion.
Reiterating their support for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of Ukraine, Members are convinced that Russias
assertion of the right to use all means to protect Russian minorities in third countries, is not supported by international law and contravenes
fundamental principles of international conduct in the 21st century, while also threatening to undermine the post-war European order.
Parliament therefore calls on the Federation Council of Russia to immediately withdraw its mandate to use force on Ukrainian soil.
Members reiterate the necessity for the EU and its Member States to speak to Russia with one united voice. They call on the Council to swiftly
apply an arms and dual-use technology embargo and call for measures against Russian companies and their subsidiaries, particularly in the
energy sector, as well as Russian investments and assets in the EU. Parliament asks the EU to review all agreements with Russia with a view
to their possible suspension.
Calling on Russia to enter into dialogue with Ukraine, Parliament supports the introduction of economic, trade and financial restrictions in
respect of Crimea and its separatist leadership.
Elections and structural reforms in Ukraine: Members urge that the presidential elections on 25 May 2014 be conducted in full compliance with
international standards and reject any external pressure to delay these elections. They welcome the Ukrainian Governments intention to hold
early parliamentary elections.
Members welcome the announcement by the Ukrainian Government of an ambitious economic and social reform agenda, and support the
conditionality laid down by the EU regarding much-needed structural reforms that will help create more favourable conditions for sustainable
economic growth. They call for specific measures to help the most vulnerable sections of the population.
Association Agreement (AA) with the EU: Parliament welcomes the signing of the political provisions of the AA and expects the quick
implementation of the autonomous trade preferences adopted by the EU to bridge the gap until the signing of the remainder of the agreement,
which includes the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA). It welcomes the initial measures adopted by the Commission to
enable Ukraine to tackle an energy crisis should Russia cut gas supplies to the country, and urges the Council and the Commission to assist
and support Kiev in its efforts to resolve the long-standing gas dispute with Moscow.
Members stress the urgent need for a strong common energy security policy (an Energy Union), with the aim of reducing the EUs dependency
on Russian oil and gas. According to the Members, the South Stream pipeline should not be built, and the Union should search for other
sources of supply.
Other measures are sought such as the liberalisation of visas with Ukraine.
Members reiterate that the AAs with Ukraine and the other EaP countries do not constitute the final goal in their relations with the EU , and
point out in this connection that, pursuant to Article 49 of the TEU, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine like any other European state have a
European perspective and may apply to become members of the Union.
At the same time they stress that the Russian concerns as regards the EU association process of Ukraine and the other Eastern neighbours
must be adequately addressed and explained, so as to ease fears of new geopolitical dividing lines on the European continent. The EUs
engagement with the Eastern partners aims to spread prosperity and increase political stability, from which the Russian Federation will also
ultimately gain. They call, furthermore, for a frank and open dialogue with the Russian Federation in order to make every effort to develop
synergies aimed at benefiting EaP countries.
Transnistria: lastly, expressing particular concern over renewed instability in the separatist region of Transnistria in Moldova, Parliament
believes that the recent request of 16 April 2014, by the self-proclaimed authorities in Tiraspol for Transnistria to be recognised by Russia as
an independent state represents a dangerous and irresponsible step. It reiterates its full support for Moldovas territorial integrity and calls for
an enhancement of the EU's status to that of negotiating partner, leading towards a peaceful and sustainable settlement of the issue.
