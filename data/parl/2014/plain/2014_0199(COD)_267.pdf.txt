2014/0199(COD) - 27/06/2014 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to codify Council Regulation (EC) No 153/2002 on certain procedures for applying the Stabilisation and Association Agreement
between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, of the other
part, and for applying the Interim Agreement between the European Community and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and rationality, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No
153/2002 of 21 January 2002 on certain procedures for applying
the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, of the other part, and for applying the Interim Agreement between the European Community and the Former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
Council Regulation (EC) No 153/2002 has been substantially amended several times. It is recalled that on 1 April 1987 the Commission
decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement.
The Conclusions of the Presidency of the December 1992 Edinburgh European Council confirmed this, stressing the importance of
codification.
The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an
accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments.
The new proposed Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it; this proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being
codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise

itself.

2014/0199(COD) - 16/04/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Legal Affairs adopted the report by DUDA (ECR, PL) on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the
Council on certain procedures for applying the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their
Member States, of the one part, and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, of the other part (codified text).
The parliamentary committee recommends that the European Parliament adopts its position at first reading, taking over the Commission
proposal as adapted to the recommendations of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council
and the Commission.
The draft proposal is accompanied by an opinion of a Consultative Working Party of the respective legal services. This stated, by common
accord, that in the first paragraph of Article 7 of the draft codified text the words "as provided for in Articles 38 and 39 of the SAA" should be
adapted so as to read "as provided for in Articles 37 and 38 of the SAA".
As a result, the Consultative Working Party concluded that the proposal is a straightforward codification of existing texts, without any change in
their substance.

2014/0199(COD) - 29/04/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 628 votes to 49, with 19 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council on certain procedures for applying the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the
European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, of the other part (codified
text).
Parliament adopted its position at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure taking over the Commission proposal.
The Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission concluded that the
proposal in question contains a straightforward codification of the existing texts without any change in their substance.
The proposed codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 153/2002 seeks to adopt the application of certain measures of the Stabilisation and
Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia, of the other part (SAA) which was signed in Luxembourg on 9 April 2001 and entered into force on 1 April 2004.
The proposal mainly seeks to:
lay down provisions for the calculation of the reduced rate of customs duties for certain products imported into the Union originating in
the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia;
enable the Commission, assisted by the Committee established by Article 229 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European
Parliament and of the Council, to adopt the Regulations opening up and
providing for the administration of the tariff quotas for baby beef products;
provide that the Commission, assisted by the Committee, adopt the Regulations opening and providing for the administration of tariff
quotas which might be granted as a result of negotiations on further tariff concessions pursuant to Article 29 of the SAA;
provide that duties should be totally suspended where preferential treatment results in ad valorem duties of 1% or less, or in specific
duties of EUR 1 or less;
stipulates that the implementation of the safeguard clauses should be adopted in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the
European Parliament and of the Council (comitology);
enable the Commission to adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases relating to exceptional and
critical circumstances, imperative grounds of urgency so require.

2014/0199(COD) - 09/06/2015 Final act
PURPOSE: the codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 153/2002 on certain procedures for applying the Stabilisation and Association

Macedonia.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Regulation (EU) 2015/941 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 June 2015 on certain procedures for
applying the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the
former Yugoslav Republic ofMacedonia, of the other part.
CONTENT: Regulation (EC) No 153/2002 has been substantially amended several times. Consequently, in the interests of clarity and
rationality, it was decided to codify it.
The Regulation seeks to:
given that the SAA stipulates that certain products originating in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia may be imported into the
Union at a reduced customs duty, within the limits of tariff quotas, the Regulation lays down provisions for the calculation of the
reduced rates of customs duties;
allows the Commission, assisted by the Committee established by Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of
the Council, to adopt the Regulations opening up and providing for the administration of the tariff quotas for baby beef products ;
allows the Commission, assisted by a Committee, to adopt the Regulations opening and providing for the administration of tariff
quotas which might be granted as a result of negotiations on further tariff concessions pursuant to Article 29 of the SAA;

provide for the total suspension of duties where preferential treatment results in ad valorem duties of 1 % or less, or in specific duties
of EUR 1 or less;
stipulate that any safeguard measures should be adopted in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European
Parliament and the Council;
enable the Commission to adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases relating to exceptional and
critical circumstances arising, imperative grounds of urgency so require.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 15.7.2015. Regulation (EC) No 153/2002 is repealed.
