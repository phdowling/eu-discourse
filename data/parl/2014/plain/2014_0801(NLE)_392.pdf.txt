2014/0801(NLE) - 14/01/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs adopted the report by Sharon BOWLES (ADLE, UK), in which it delivers a favourable
opinion on the Council recommendation to appoint Sabine Lautenschläger as Member of the Executive Board of the ECB for a term of office of
eight years.
Members evaluated the credentials of Ms Lautenschläger, in particular in view of the requirements laid down in Article 283(2) of the Treaty on
the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and in the light of the need for full independence of the ECB in the area of monetary policy.
In carrying out this evaluation, the committee received a curriculum vitae from Ms Lautenschläger as well as her replies to the written
questionnaire that had been sent to her.
The committee subsequently held a hearing with Ms Lautenschläger on 13 January 2014, at which she made an opening statement and then
responded to questions from the members of the committee.

2014/0801(NLE) - 16/01/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 443 votes to 47, with 44 abstentions, a decision delivering a favourable opinion on the Council
recommendation to appoint Sabine Lautenschläger (DE) as Member of the Executive Board of the ECB for a term of office of eight years.
