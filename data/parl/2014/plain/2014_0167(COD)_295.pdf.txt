2014/0167(COD) - 28/05/2014 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 1061/2009 of 19 October 2009 establishing common rules for exports.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 1061/2009 has been substantially amended several times. It is recalled that in 1987, the
Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum
requirement. The Edinburgh European Council in December 1992 confirmed the importance of codification as it offers certainty as to the law
applicable to a given matter at a given time.
The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an
accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments.
CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and transparency of Union law, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council
Regulation (EC) No 1061/2009 establishing common rules for exports.
The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it; it fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does
no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself.
The proposed Regulation establishes the basic principle according to which the exportation of products from the Union to third countries shall
be free, that is to say, they shall not be subject to any quantitative restriction , with the exception of those restrictions which are applied in
conformity with the provisions of this Regulation. It should apply to all products, whether industrial or agricultural.

The main elements of the proposed Regulation concern:
Union information and consultation procedure: if, as a result of any unusual developments on the market, a Member State considers that
protective measures might be necessary, it shall so notify the Commission, which shall advise the other Member States.
For the purpose of assessing the economic and commercial situation as regards a particular product, the Commission may request Member
States to supply statistical data on market trends in that product and, to this end.
Safeguard measures: in order to prevent a critical situation from arising on account of a shortage of essential products, or to remedy such a
situation, and where Union interests call for immediate intervention, the Commission, acting at the request of a Member State or on its own
initiative, may make the export of a product subject to the production of an export authorisation. The European Parliament, the Council and the
Member States shall be notified of the measures taken. Such measures shall take effect immediately.
Any protective measures necessitated by the interests of the Union should be adopted with due regard for existing international obligations.
For the implementation of this Regulation, the Commission shall be assisted by the Committee on Safeguards. The implementing measures
shall be adopted by the Commission in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council on
comitology.

2014/0167(COD) - 14/11/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Legal Affairs adopted the report by Andrzej DUDA (ECR, PL) on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament
and of the Council on common rules for exports (codified text).
It recommended the European Parliament to adopt its position at first reading, taking over the Commission proposal as adapted to the
recommendations of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
The Consultative Working Party stated that the proposal in question contains a straightforward codification of the existing texts without any
change in their substance.

2014/0167(COD) - 11/02/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 636 votes to 28, with 36 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council on common rules for exports (codified text).
Parliament adopted its position at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure taking over the Commission proposal as adapted to
the recommendations of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
According to the Consultative Working Party, the proposal in question contains a straightforward codification of the existing texts without any
change in their substance.
The proposed regulation establishes the principle according to which exports to third countries are not subject to any quantitative restriction,
subject to the exceptions provided for in this regulation and without prejudice to such measures as Member States may take in conformity with
the Treaty. The regulation should apply to all products, whether industrial or agricultural.
The proposed regulation lays down rules on: (i) the Commission's information and consultation procedure regarding the need for safeguard
measures; (ii) protective measures necessitated by the interests of the Union.

2014/0167(COD) - 11/03/2015 Final act
PURPOSE: to codify Council Regulation (EC) No 1061/2009 establishing common rules for exports.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Regulation (EU) 2015/479 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing common rules for exports
(codification).
CONTENT: the Regulation codifies and repeals Council Regulation (EC) nÂ° 1061/2009 which has been substantially amended on several
occasions.
The Regulation establishes the basic principle according to which the export of products from the Union to third countries shall be free, that is
to say, they shall not be subject to any quantitative restriction, with the exception of those restrictions which are applied in conformity with the
provisions of the Regulation. It should apply to all products, whether industrial or agricultural.
The main points of the Regulation are as follows:
Union information and consultation procedure: if, as a result of any unusual developments on the market, a Member State considers that
protective measures might be necessary, it shall so notify the Commission, which shall advise the other Member States.
The Commission may request Member States to supply statistical data on market trends in that product for the purpose of assessing the
economic and commercial situation as regards a particular product.
Safeguard measures: in order to prevent a critical situation from arising on account of a shortage of essential products, or to remedy such a
situation, and where Union interests call for immediate intervention, the Commission, acting at the request of a Member State or on its own
initiative, may make the export of a product subject to the production of an export authorisation. The European Parliament, the Council and the
Member States shall be notified of the measures taken. Such measures shall take effect immediately.
Where intervention by the Commission has been requested by a Member State, the Commission shall take a decision within a maximum of

five working days of the date of receipt of such request.
Any protective measures necessitated by the interests of the Union should be adopted with due regard for existing international obligations.
Transitional provisions: in respect of products listed in Annex I, Member States shall be authorised to implement the emergency sharing
system introducing an allocation obligation vis-Ã -vis third countries provided for in international commitments entered into before the entry into
force of the Regulation.
This authorisation should apply until the adoption by the European Parliament and the Council of appropriate measures pursuant to
commitments entered into by the Union or all the Member States.
In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers are conferred on the Commission.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 16.4.2015.
