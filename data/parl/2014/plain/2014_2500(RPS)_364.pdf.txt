Summary

2014/2500(RPS) - 05/02/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament decided to raise no objections to the draft Commission regulation amending Commission Regulation (EU) No
1178/2011 laying down technical requirements and administrative procedures related to civil aviation aircrew.
To recall, Commission Regulation (EU) No 1178/2011 lays down technical requirements and administrative procedures related to civil aviation
aircrew.
Some Member States have found that certain requirements of Regulation (EU) No 1178/2011 place an undue and disproportionate
administrative or economic burden on themselves or on stakeholders and have requested derogations from certain requirements.

A number of editorial errors leading to unintended implementation difficulties have also been identified in Commission Regulation (EU) No
1178/2011 by Member States. Therefore, the Commission proposed that the existing requirements should be amended in order to introduce
the derogations that have a clear rulemaking effect and to correct editorial errors.
The proposal seeks to introduce additional requirements for the qualification to fly in instrument meteorological conditions and specific
requirements for sailplane cloud flying operations.
In order to ensure that instrument training or experience gained before the application of this Regulation may be taken into account for the
purpose of obtaining these ratings, the conditions for crediting this training, or the instrument experience gained should be laid down.
It should be possible for Member States to give credit for the instrument experience of a third-country rating holder if a level of safety
equivalent to that specified by Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 can be guaranteed. Conditions for recognising this experience should also be laid
down.
