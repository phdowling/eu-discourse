Summary

The European Parliament adopted a resolution on the situation in Iraq.
The resolution was tabled by EPP, S&D, ALDE, Greens/EFA and ECR groups.
It strongly condemned recent acts of terrorism and heightened sectarian violence, which carried the danger that the country will fall back into
sectarian strife. Members pointed out however, that although violence occurred along sectarian lines, its causes were political rather than
religious.
Parliament stated that the government of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki had not addressed the concerns of the Sunni minority. In addition, the
de-Baathification policy pursuant to the Justice and Accountability Law had led to the dismissal of predominantly Sunni officials, which had
reinforced the perception of the governments sectarian agenda. The demolition of the Sunni protest camp in Ramadi by the government on
30 December 2013 precipitated the violent confrontation in Anbar province and as a result, Fallujah and other cities in Anbar province had
seen fighting between government forces and ISIL militants since December 2013.
Members were deeply concerned about the developments in Anbar province and strongly condemned the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant
(ISIL) attacks, noting the large numbers of internally displaced persons fleeing the conflict zones. Parliament called for humanitarian access to
Fallujah and for the Government of Iraq to continue to work with the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) and humanitarian
agencies to ensure the delivery of humanitarian relief. It asked EEAS and the Commission to support all the efforts of the Iraqi Government
and UNAMI in protecting the civilian population in Fallujah so as to try to ensure the safe passage of civilians trapped in conflict areas.
Members also condemned the rocket attack at Camp Hurriya on 26 December 2013, urging the Iraqi Government to find the perpetrators of
the attack and hold them accountable.
Parliament supported the EUs efforts in Iraq through building on the experiences and achievements of the EUJUST LEX-Iraq mission, which
regrettably completed its mandate on 31 December 2013, along with the efforts of UNAMI and of the Special Representative of the UN
Secretary-General. It welcomed the capacity-building programme launched on 22 January 2014 funded by the EU and implemented by the
UN Office for Project Services to support the Iraqi High Commission for Human Rights.
Parliament called on the Iraqi Government to address the long-term issues contributing to the countrys instability, including the legitimate
concerns of the Sunni minority, by launching an inclusive national dialogue on the reform of the Justice and Accountability Law, refraining from
inflammatory sectarian statements and implementing measures aimed at national reconciliation. It rejected calls for the establishment of a
Sunni federal region in Iraq as a solution to the current conflict, stating that this was likely to lead to more sectarianism and violence. Members
called on the Iraqi Government and on all political leaders to take the necessary measures to provide security and protection for all people in
Iraq, stating their concern about the continuing acts of violence perpetrated against the civilian population, vulnerable groups and religious
communities.
Members highlighted the importance of the general elections due to take place on 30 April 2014 for Iraqs continued democratic transition,
calling on the EEAS to assist the Iraqi Government as much as possible with the practical preparations. They noted with concern the spill-over
of violence from the conflict in Syria and called on the Iraqi Government to make a strong effort to insulate Iraq from the Syrian civil war by
refraining from supporting any party involved in the conflict and by preventing fighters, both Sunni and Shiite, from crossing from or into Syria.
It felt that the recent talks between the E3+3 and Iran also afford edan opportunity for Iraq to stabilise, provided that all neighbouring powers
cease to interfere in Iraqi internal affairs.
Lastly, it It called for the EU to develop a common position in favour of prohibiting the use of depleted uranium munitions
