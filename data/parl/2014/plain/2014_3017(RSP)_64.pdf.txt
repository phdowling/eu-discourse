Summary

The European Parliament adopted a resolution on the situation in Egypt.
The text adopted in plenary was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ECR, ALDE, Greens/EFA groups and Fabio Massimo CASTALDO and Ignazio
CORRAO (EFDD, IT).
Parliament recalled that since the military takeover of June 2013, the Egyptian Government has conducted a large-scale campaign of arbitrary
detention, harassment, intimidation and censorship against government critics solely for exercising their rights to free assembly, association
and expression, including journalists, students and human rights defenders, and against political opponents.
It stressed that thousands of protesters and prisoners of conscience have been detained in Egypt since the Egyptian army seized power and
that on 10 January 2015 an Egyptian court in the Nile Delta province of Baheira sentenced Karim al-Banna, a 21-year-old student, to three
years in jail for announcing on Facebook that he is an atheist and for insulting Islam.
Given that the Egyptian authorities have tightened the noose on freedom of expression and the freedom of the media, Parliament reminded
the Egyptian Government that the long-term success of Egypt and its people depends on the protection of universal human rights and on the
establishment and anchoring of democratic and transparent institutions.
Parliament also called for the immediate and unconditional release of all prisoners of conscience and urged the Egyptian authorities to take
concrete steps to ensure that the provisions of the new Constitution on fundamental rights and freedoms, including freedom of expression and
assembly, are fully implemented.
The Egyptian authorities are called upon to:
conduct prompt, impartial and independent investigations into allegations of excessive use of force, ill-treatment and other human
rights violations, including sexual abuse;
reverse the death sentences handed down without consideration for due process which respects the rights of the defendants;
engage in a genuine dialogue with civil society organisations and legal experts in order to enact legislation on associations and
assembly;
ensure the immediate and unconditional release of all kidnapped Egyptian citizens currently held in Libya, including the 20 Egyptian
Copts abducted on 3 January 2015.
Terrorism in the Sinau Penisula: Parliament highlighted the security situation in Sinai which is critical, with hundreds of soldiers being killed by
jihadist groups operating in the area. It noted that acts of terror are taking place in this region almost on a daily basis and that the state ordered
the eviction of thousands of residents of Rafah and established a 500-metre buffer zone along the Gaza border. In this regard, Parliament
stressed that the fact that the EU and the international community must stand firm and cooperate with Egypt in its fight against terrorism. It
called on the Egyptian authorities to do their utmost to stop criminal networks that are still operating on the human trafficking/smuggling routes
within and towards Sinai.
Women and LGBT: Parliament urged the Egyptian Government to fully implement national strategies for combating violence against women
and eliminating all forms of discrimination. It urged the Egyptian authorities to cease criminalising LGBT people, on the basis of the
debauchery law, for expressing their sexual orientation.
Cooperation: Parliament invited the Member States to define a common strategy among Member States towards Egypt. It urged the Council,
the VP/HR and the Commission to work actively in accordance with the principle of conditionality (more for more) and to take into
consideration the serious economic challenges faced by Egypt in its bilateral relations with, and its financial support for, the country.
In this context, Parliament requested in particular, clarification of the status of:
the planned justice reform programme;
the EU budget support programmes;
the trade and domestic enhancement programme;
Egypts participation in EU regional programmes such as Euromed Police and Euromed Justice.
Lastly, Parliament called for an EU-wide ban on the export to Egypt of intrusion and surveillance technologies which could be used to spy on
and repress citizens.
