2014/0165(COD) - 28/05/2014 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 953/2003 of 26 May 2003 to avoid trade diversion into the European Union of certain
key medicines.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 953/2003 has been substantially amended several times. On 1 April 1987, the Commission
decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement.
The Conclusions of the Presidency of the Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this, stressing the importance of
codification.
The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an
accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments.
CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and transparency of Union law, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council
Regulation (EC) No 953/2003 to avoid trade diversion into the European Union of certain key medicines.

The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it; it fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does
no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself.
Price segmentation between developed country markets and the poorest developing country markets is necessary to ensure that the poorest
developing countries are supplied with essential pharmaceutical products at heavily reduced prices. Therefore, those heavily reduced prices
cannot be understood as a reference for the price to be paid for the same products in developed country markets.
The proposed codified Regulation serves the purpose of preventing tiered priced products from being imported into the Union. Exemptions are
laid down for certain situations under the strict provision that it is ensured that the final destination of the products in question is one of the
countries listed in Annex II. More specifically, the proposed Regulation lays down:
the criteria for establishing what is a tiered priced product;
the conditions under which the customs authorities shall take action;
the measures which shall be taken by the competent authorities in the Member States.

2014/0165(COD) - 24/02/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Legal Affairs adopted the report by Laura FERRARA (EFD, IT) on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament
and of the Council to avoid trade diversion into the European Union of certain key medicines (codified text).
The committee recommended the European Parliament to adopt its position at first reading, taking over the Commission proposal as adapted
to the recommendations of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
According to the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, the proposal
in question contains a straightforward codification of the existing texts without any change in their substance.
Price segmentation between developed country markets and the poorest developing country markets is necessary to ensure that the poorest
developing countries are supplied with essential pharmaceutical products at heavily reduced prices. Therefore, those heavily reduced prices
cannot be understood as a reference for the price to be paid for the same products in developed country markets.
The proposed codified Regulation serves the purpose of preventing tiered priced products from being imported into the Union. Exemptions are
laid down for certain situations.

2014/0165(COD) - 09/03/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 664 votes to 29, with 4 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council to avoid trade diversion into the European Union of certain key medicines (codified text).
Parliament adopted its position at first reading, taking over the Commission proposal. The proposal in question aims to codify Council
Regulation (EC) No 953/2003 which has been substantially amended several times. The proposal contains a straightforward codification of the
existing texts without any change in their substance.
The proposed codified Regulation serves the purpose of preventing tiered priced products from being imported into the Union. Exemptions are
laid down for certain situations on the strict condition that it is ensured that the final destination of the products in question is one of the
countries listed in Annex II. More specifically, the proposal lays down:
the criteria for establishing what is a tiered-priced product;
the conditions under which the customs authorities shall take action;
the measures which shall be taken by the competent authorities in the Member States.
The term tiered-priced product shall mean any pharmaceutical product which is used in the prevention, diagnosis or treatment of a disease,
referred to in Annex IV, and which is priced in accordance with one of the optional price calculations set out in the Regulation, verified by the
Commission or an independent auditor and entered in the list of tiered-priced products set out in Annex I.

2014/0165(COD) - 11/05/2016 Final act
PURPOSE: the codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 953/2003 of 26 May 2003 to avoid trade diversion into the European Union of
certain key medicines.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Regulation (EU) 2016/793 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2016 to avoid trade diversion into the
European Union of certain key medicines (codification).
CONTENT: in the interests of legal clarity and transparency, this Regulation codifies and repeals Council Regulation (EC) No 953/2003 which
had been substantially amended several times.
Price segmentation between developed country markets and the poorest developing country markets is necessary to ensure that the poorest
developing countries are supplied with essential pharmaceutical products at heavily reduced prices. Therefore, those heavily reduced prices
cannot be understood as a reference for the price to be paid for the same products in developed country markets.
This codified Regulation prohibits the importation into the European Union of tiered-priced products.
Derogations are laid down for certain situations under the strict provision that it is ensured that the final destination of the products in question
is one of the countries listed in the Regulations Annex II.

Tiered-priced products are any pharmaceutical products used in the prevention, diagnosis or treatment of a disease such as HIV/AIDS,
malaria, tuberculosis and related oppotunistic diseases, which are priced in accordance with one of the optional price calculations set out in
the Regulation, verified by the Commission or an independent auditor, and and entered in the list of tiered-priced products in Annex I of the
Regulation.
More specifically, the Regulation sets:
the criteria for establishing what is a tiered priced product;
the conditions under which the customs authorities shall take action;
the measures which shall be taken by the competent authorities in the Member States.
The Commission shall monitor on an annual basis the volumes of exports of tiered-priced products listed in Annex I and exported to the
countries of destination. It shall report biennially to the European Parliament and to the Council on the volumes exported under tiered prices.
The European Parliament may, within one month of submission of the Commission's report, invite the Commission to an ad hoc meeting of its
responsible committee to present and explain any issues related to the application of this Regulation. No later than six months from the date of
submission of the report to the European Parliament and to the Council, the Commission shall make the report public.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 13.6.2016.
DELEGATED ACTS: the Commission may adopt delegated acts to add products to the list of tiered-priced products covered by the
Regulation. The power to adopt such delegated acts shall be conferred on the Commission for a period of 5 years from 20 February 2014 (a
period that can be tacitly extended for periods of an identical duration). The European Parliament or the Council may raise objections to a
delegated act within three months of notification (which may be extended by three months.) If Parliament or Council raise objections, the
delegated act will not enter into force.

2014/0165(COD) - 09/12/2016 Follow-up document
The Commission presented a report on the application of Regulation (EU) 2016/793 of the European Parliament and of the Council to avoid
trade diversion into the European Union of certain key medicines.
The Regulation puts in place safeguards to prevent diversion of medicines from poor developing countries into the European Union.
Supplying poor and developing countries with medicines at sustainable low prices is one of the objectives in the fight against the major
diseases of HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. In order to achieve this, the European Commission has consistently advocated a policy of
"tiered pricing" for medicines, combined with market segmentation between rich and poor countries.
This report is the ninth Report under Article 12(2) of the Regulation which foresees biennially reports by the Commission to the European
Parliament and to the Council on the volumes exported under tiered prices registered under the Regulation. It covers the period from 1
January 2014 to 31 December 2015.
Evaluation: the Regulation was evaluated on four criteria: effectiveness, efficiency, coherence and relevance. It was assessed against the
REFIT criteria of being fit for purpose, having delivered on its objectives at minimum cost and whether there is potential for simplification.
The analysis of stakeholders' and experts' input by the external contractor found no evidence that there was scope for improving the
effectiveness of the Regulation by modifying the list of countries of destination.
Exported products: one company, GlaxoSmithKline / ViiV Healthcare, has medicines registered under the Regulation. These products were
registered in 2004 and all aim at the treatment of HIV/AIDS.
During the reference period, six products were exported under tiered prices to China, Honduras, Indonesia, Kenya, Moldova, Nigeria, South
Africa, and Uganda.
The products were sold to the countries listed at the price of production, with no mark-up, and therefore in accordance with the criteria of the
Regulation.
