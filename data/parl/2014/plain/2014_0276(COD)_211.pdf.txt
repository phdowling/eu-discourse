2014/0276(COD) - 26/09/2014 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to codify Council Regulation (EC) No 774/94 opening and providing for the administration of certain Community tariff quotas for
high-quality beef, and for pigmeat, poultrymeat, wheat and meslin, and brans, sharps and other residues.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the Council and the European Parliament.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to
follow its opinion.
BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 774/94 has been substantially amended several times. It is recalled that on 1 April 1987, the
Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum
requirement. The Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this, stressing the importance of codification.
The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an
accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments.
CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and rationality, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No
774/94 of 29 March 1994 opening and providing for the administration of certain Community tariff quotas for high-quality beef, and for pigmeat,
poultrymeat, wheat and meslin, and brans, sharps and other residues.
The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it. Furthermore, it fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and
hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself.
Opening of tariff quotas: the Union negotiated tariff concessions under Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)
and under the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. Those negotiations led to agreements which provide for the opening, under

certain conditions, of certain annual Community tariff quotas for high-quality beef, and for pigmeat, poultrymeat, wheat and meslin, and brans,
sharps and other residues.
The proposal aims therefore to open annual Community tariff quotas for high-quality beef, and for pigmeat, poultrymeat, wheat and meslin,
and brans, sharps and other residues.
Management: the Commission:
should be empowered to adopt delegated acts in respect of the adoption of amendments to this Regulation, should the volumes and
other conditions of quota arrangements be adjusted, in particular as a result of a Council decision concluding an agreement with one
or more third countries;
should adopt, by means of implementing acts, rules necessary for the administration of the quota arrangements referred to in this
Regulation and, as appropriate, provisions: (a) guaranteeing the nature, provenance and origin of the product; (b) relating to the
recognition of the document allowing the guarantees referred to in point (a) to be verified; and (c) on the issue of import licences and
their period of validity.

2014/0276(COD) - 05/12/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Legal Affairs adopted the report by Andrzej DUDA (ECR, PL) on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament
and of the Council opening and providing for the administration of certain Union tariff quotas for high-quality beef, and for pigmeat,
poultrymeat, wheat and meslin, and brans, sharps and other residues (codified text).
The committee recommended that Parliament adopt its position in first reading, taking over the Commission proposal as adapted to the
recommendations of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
The Consultative Working Party expressed the view that the proposal in question contains a straightforward codification of the existing texts
without any change in their substance.

2014/0276(COD) - 11/03/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 634 votes to 57, with 14 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council opening and providing for the administration of certain Union tariff quotas for high-quality beef, and for
pigmeat, poultrymeat, wheat and meslin, and brans, sharps and other residues (codified text).
Parliament adopted its position at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure, without amending the Commission proposal.
Council Regulation (EC) No 774/94 has been substantially amended several times. In the interests of clarity and rationality, it is proposed that
the Regulation be codified.
The proposal seeks to open and provide for the administration of certain Union tariff quotas for high-quality beef, and for pigmeat, poultrymeat,
wheat and meslin, and brans, sharps and other residues.
The Commission shall:
·

have the power to adopt delegated acts (for a period of five years from 9 April 2014) in respect of the adoption of amendments to
this Regulation, should the volumes and other conditions of quota arrangements be adjusted, in particular as a result of a Council
decision concluding an agreement with one or more third countries;

·

by means of implementing acts, adopt rules necessary for the administration of the quota arrangements referred to in this Regulation
and, as appropriate, lay down provisions guaranteeing the nature, provenance and origin of the product; relating to the recognition of
the document allowing the guarantees to be verified; and on the issue of import licences and their period of validity.

2014/0276(COD) - 29/04/2015 Final act
PURPOSE: to codify Council Regulation (EC) No 774/94 opening and providing for the administration of certain Community tariff quotas for
high-quality beef, and for pigmeat, poultrymeat, wheat and meslin, and brans, sharps and other residues.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Regulation (EU) 2015/754 of the European Parliament and of the Council opening and providing for the administration of
certain Union tariff quotas for high-quality beef, and for pigmeat, poultrymeat, wheat and meslin, and brans, sharps and other residues.
CONTENT: this Regulation codifies Council Regulation (EC) No 774/94 which has been substantially amended several times. Its main
elements are:
Opening of tariff quotas: the Union negotiated tariff concessions under Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)
and under the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. Those negotiations led to agreements which provide for the opening, under
certain conditions, of certain annual Community tariff quotas for high-quality beef, and for pigmeat, poultrymeat, wheat and meslin, and brans,
sharps and other residues.
Therefore, this Regulation opens annual Union tariff quotas for high-quality beef, and for pigmeat, poultrymeat, wheat and meslin, and brans,
sharps and other residues.
This Regulation opened an annual Union tariff quota:
of a total of 20 000 tonnes, expressed in product weight, is hereby opened for high-quality fresh, chilled or frozen beef covered by
specific CN codes;

of a total of 7 000 tonnes for fresh, chilled or frozen pigmeat covered by specific CN codes;
of a total of 15 500 tonnes for poultrymeat covered by specific CN codes;
of a total of 2 500 tonnes for turkey meat covered by specific CN codes;
of a total of 300 000 tonnes quality wheat covered by specific CN codes;
of a total of 475 000 tonnes for brans, sharps and other residues of wheat and cereals other than maize and rice covered by CN codes
Management: the Commission shall:
be empowered to adopt delegated acts (for a period of five years from 9 April 2014) in respect of the adoption of amendments to this
Regulation, should the volumes and other conditions of quota arrangements be adjusted, in particular as a result of a Council decision
concluding an agreement with one or more third countries;
by means of implementing acts, adopt rules necessary for the administration of the quota arrangements, and, as appropriate, lay down
provisions guaranteeing the nature, provenance and origin of the product; relating to the recognition of the document allowing the
guarantees to be verified; and the issue of import licences and their period of validity.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 8.6.2015.
