Summary

2014/2508(DEA) - 05/02/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament decided to raise no objections to the Commission delegated regulation of 7 January 2014 on the European code of
conduct on partnership in the framework of the European Structural and Investment Funds.
To recall, partnership has long been one of the key principles of the European Union funds managed by the EU and Member States together
in shared management. The partnership principle implies close cooperation between public authorities at national, regional and local levels in
the Member States and with the private and other sectors.
Experience shows, however, that Member States implement the partnership principle in very different ways, depending on national institutional
set-ups and traditions of stakeholder involvement.
Following the entry into force of the Common Provisions Regulation for the European Structural and Investment Funds, the Commission is
empowered to adopt a delegated act on a
European code of conduct to support Member States in organising the partnership. The code of conduct is intended to provide a framework for
partnership, in accordance with Member
States institutional and legal frameworks, taking account of national and regional competences.
Parliament considered it important to ensure that the delegated regulation on the European code of conduct on partnership enters into force as
soon as possible, given the urgent need for the code of conduct to apply to the ongoing preparation of the Partnership Agreements and
programmes for the 2014-2020 period.
