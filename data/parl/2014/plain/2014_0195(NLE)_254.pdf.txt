OJ L 014 18.01.2017, p. 0002 Summary

2014/0195(NLE) - 27/06/2014 Initial legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude the Protocol to the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities
and their Member States, of the one part, and Algeria, of the other part, on a Framework Agreement between the European Union and Algeria
on the general principles for the participation of Algeria in Union programmes.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: as part of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), the gradual opening-up of certain Union programmes and agencies to
the participation of ENP partner countries represents one of many measures to promote reform, modernisation and transition in the European
Union?s neighbourhood. The Commission outlined this policy aspect more extensively in its Communication of December 2006 ?on the
general approach to enable European Neighbourhood Policy partner countries to participate in Community agencies and Community
programmes?.
The Council endorsed this approach in its conclusions of 5 March 2007.

On 18 June 2007, the Council issued directives to the Commission to negotiate Framework Agreements with Algeria, Armenia, Azerbaijan,
Egypt, Georgia, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Moldova, Morocco, the Palestinian Authority, Tunisia and Ukraine, on the general principles for their
participation in Community programmes.
In February 2013, Algeria expressed its interest in participating in the broad range of programmes open to partner countries of the European
Neighbourhood Policy.
The text of the protocol negotiated with Algeria is attached to this proposal.
It is now necessary to conclude this Protocol on behalf of the European Union.
CONTENT: under this proposal, the Council is called upon to approve, on behalf of the European Union, the Protocol to the
Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part,
and Algeria, of the other part, on a Framework Agreement between the European Union and Algeria on the general principles for the
participation of Algeria in Union programmes.
It contains standard clauses that are intended to be applied to all European Neighbourhood Policy partner countries with which such protocols
are concluded.
Objective: the objective of the Protocol is to lay down the financial and technical rules enabling Algeria to participate in certain Union
programmes.
The horizontal framework established by the Protocol constitutes an economic, financial and technical cooperation measure which gives
access to assistance, in particular financial assistance, to be provided by the Union pursuant to the Union programmes.
This framework applies only to those Union programmes for which the relevant constitutive legal acts provide for the possibility of Algeria?s
participation. The signing and provisional application of the Protocol therefore does not entail the exercise of the powers under the various
sectoral policies pursued by the programmes which are exercised when establishing the programmes.

2014/0195(NLE) - 10/12/2014 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude the Protocol to the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities
and their Member States, of the one part, and Algeria, of the other part, on a Framework Agreement between the European Union and Algeria
on the general principles for the participation of Algeria in Union programmes.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: in accordance with a Council Decision, the Protocol to the EuroMediterranean Agreement establishing an Association
between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and Algeria, of the other part, on a Framework Agreement between
the European Union and Algeria on the general principles for the participation of Algeria in Union programmes was signed on behalf of the
Union.
It is now necessary to approve the Protocol on behalf of the European Union.
CONTENT: the Council is invited to approve the Protocol to the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an association between the
European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Algeria, of the other part, on a Framework Agreement between the
European Union and Algeria on the general principles for the participation of Algeria in Union programmes.
For further details of the Protocol, please refer to the summary of the initial Commission proposal dated 27.6.2014 .
The objective of the Protocol is to lay down the financial and technical rules enabling Algeria to participate in certain Union programmes.
General principles for the participation of Algeria in Union programmes: the horizontal framework established by the Protocol constitutes an
economic, financial and technical cooperation measure which allows for access to assistance, in particular financial assistance, to be provided
by the Union pursuant to the Union programmes. This framework applies only to those Union programmes for which the relevant constitutive
legal acts provide for the possibility of the participation of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria. The conclusion of the Protocol
therefore does not entail the exercise of the powers, under the various sectoral policies pursued by the programmes, which are exercised
when establishing the programmes.

2014/0195(NLE) - 05/12/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Foreign Affairs adopted the report by Pier Antonio PANZERI (S&D, IT) on the draft Council decision on the conclusion of
the Protocol to the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an Association between the European Community and its Member States, of
the one part, and the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria, of the other part, on a Framework Agreement between the European Union and
the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria on the general principles for the participation of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria in
Union programmes.
The committee recommended that the European Parliament give its consent to the conclusion of the Protocol.
To recall, the objective of the Protocol is to lay down the financial and technical rules enabling Algeria to participate in certain Union
programmes. The horizontal framework established by the Protocol constitutes an economic, financial and technical cooperation measure,
which gives access to Union financial assistance, pursuant to the Union programmes.

2014/0195(NLE) - 13/12/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading

The European Parliament adopted by 594 votes to 70, with 13 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the draft Council decision on the
conclusion of the Protocol to the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an Association between the European Community and its
Member States, of the one part, and the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria, of the other part, on a Framework Agreement between the
European Union and the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria on the general principles for the participation of the People's Democratic
Republic of Algeria in Union programmes.
In line with its Committee on Foreign Affairs, Parliament gave its consent to the conclusion of the Protocol.
As a reminder, the objective of the Protocol is to lay down the financial and technical rules enabling Algeria to participate in certain Union
programmes. The horizontal framework established by the Protocol constitutes an economic, financial and technical cooperation measure,
which gives access to Union financial assistance, pursuant to the Union programmes.
