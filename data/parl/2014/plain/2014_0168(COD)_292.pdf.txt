2014/0168(COD) - 28/05/2014 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 625/2009 of 7 July 2009 on common rules for imports from certain third countries.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and transparency of Union law, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council
Regulation (EC) No 625/2009 on common rules for imports from certain third countries.
Council Regulation (EC) No 625/2009 has been substantially amended several times. It is recalled that in 1987, the Commission decided to
instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The
Edinburgh European Council in December 1992 confirmed the importance of codification as it offers certainty as to the law applicable to a
given matter at a given time.
The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an
accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments.
The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it; it fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does
no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself.

2014/0168(COD) - 28/01/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on International Trade adopted the report by Jaros?aw WA??SA (EPP, PL) on the proposal for a regulation of the European
Parliament and of the Council on common rules for imports from certain third countries (recast).
The committee recommended the European Parliament to adopt its position at first reading, taking over the Commission proposal and taking
account of the recommendations of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the
Commission.
According to the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, the
Commission proposal does not include any substantive amendments other than those identified as such in the proposal.
The Commission considered that in order to incorporate some substantive amendments, it was deemed necessary to transform the
codification into a recast. As regards the substance of these proposals, they are largely technical corrections.
The main change resulting from the recast concerns updating the annex to remove countries which have now become members of the World
Trade Organisation, namely Armenia, Russia, Tajikistan and Vietnam.

2014/0168(COD) - 11/03/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 643 votes to 32, with 30 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council on common rules for imports from certain third countries (recast).
Parliament adopted its position at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure, without amending the Commission proposal.
The proposal to recast Council Regulation (EC) No 625/2009 lays down surveillance and safeguard measures applicable to specific imports,
such as coal and steel products, with the exception of textile products which is subject to a separate regulation.
This Regulation applies to imports of products originating in a restricted number of third countries (Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, North
Korea, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan).
The main change resulting from the recast concerns updating the annex to remove countries which have now become members of the World
Trade Organisation, namely Armenia, Russia, Tajikistan and Vietnam.

2014/0168(COD) - 29/04/2015 Final act
PURPOSE: codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 625/2009 of 17 July 2009 on common rules for imports from certain third countries.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Regulation (EU) 2015/755 of the European Parliament and of the Council on common rules for imports from certain third
countries.
CONTENT: the Regulation recasts Council Regulation (EC) No 625/2009. It applies to imports of products originating in the third countries
referred to in Annex I (Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, North Korea, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan) with the exception of textile products
covered by a separate Regulation. Imports into the Union of these products shall take place freely and accordingly shall not be subject to any
quantitative restrictions.
The Regulation introduced:

an information and consultation procedure of the Union to inform the Commission, by the Member States, when the trends in imports
appear to call for surveillance or safeguard measures;
a Union investigation procedure: in the case of some products, the Commission should examine import terms and conditions, import
trends, the various aspects of the economic and commercial situation, and the measures, if any, to be taken. Time limits are set for the
initiation of investigations and for determinations as to whether, or not, measures are appropriate, with a view to ensuring that such
determinations are made quickly;
the Union's surveillance measures on certain imports on the Commissions initiative or at the request of a Member State, where the
Unions interests so require. However, such measures shall not prevent the release for free circulation of products already on their way
to the Union provided that the destination of such products cannot be changed and that those products which, may be put into free
circulation only on production of a surveillance document are in fact accompanied by such a document;
safeguard measures where a product is imported into the Union in such greatly increased quantities or on such terms or conditions as
to cause, or threaten to cause, serious injury to Union producers of like or directly competing products.
Lastly, Armenia, Russia, Tajikistan and Vietnam have become members of the WTO and therefore have been deleted from Annex I of the
Regulation.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 8.6.2015.
DELEGATED ACTS: the Commission may adopt delegated acts in order to remove countries from the list of third countries contained in Annex
I when they become members of the WTO. The power to adopt such acts is conferred on the Commission for a period of five years (tacitly
extended) from 20 February 2014. The European Parliament or the Council may object to a delegated act within two months from the date of
notification (this period may be extended by two months). If the European Parliament or the Council objects to the delegated act, it shall not
enter into force.
