2014/0337(COD) - 28/11/2014 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to repeal a certain number of legal measures in the area of freedom, security and justice that have been identified as obsolete.
PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: in its Communication of June 2014 on "Regulatory Fitness and Performance Programme (REFIT): State of Play and Outlook
", the Commission stated that it was screening the acquis in respect of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters in order
to identify acts which could be repealed in the context of the expiry of the transitional period set out in the Treaties.
The Commission has now completed its assessment on the legal acts related to the area of freedom, security and justice, including the former
third pillar acquis. They are no longer relevant because of their temporary nature or because their content has been taken up by successive
acts.
CONTENT: for reasons of legal certainty, the Commission proposes that a certain number of acts adopted in the Area of Freedom, Security
and Justice (12 in total) are revoked by the European Parliament and the Council.

2014/0337(COD) - 14/09/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs adopted the report by Claude MORAES (S&D, UK) on the proposal for a decision
of the European Parliament and of the Council repealing certain acts in the Area of Freedom Security and Justice.
The committee recommended that the position of the European Parliament adopted at first reading under the ordinary legislative procedure
should amend the Commission proposal.
Members proposed to change the type of act from 'decision' to 'regulation'. They stressed that in accordance with the Article 288 TFEU a
regulation is binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States and will better serve the purpose of the proposal to repeal the
acts deemed to be obsolete.
Therefore, the proposal repeals:
11 decisions of the Schengen Executive Committee because their content has been taken up in successive acts,
Council Regulation (EC) No 189/2008 of 18 February 2008 on the tests of the second generation Schengen Information System (SIS
II) which exhausted its legal effect once the SIS II became operational on 9 April 2013.
The report also proposed several amendments seeking to improve the drafting of the act, including an addition in the title stating that the
repealed acts in question are part of the Schengen acquis, as well as an amendment to clarify that the Denmark is not bound by Regulation or

subject to its application, but that it shall decide, in accordance with Protocol No 22 annexed to the Treaties, decide within a period of six
months after the Council has decided on this Regulation whether it will implement it in its national law.

2014/0337(COD) - 24/11/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 601 votes to 10, with 56 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a decision of the
European Parliament and of the Council repealing certain acts in the Area of Freedom Security and Justice.
Parliaments position adopted at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure amended the Commission proposal as follows:
Parliament proposed to change the type of act from 'decision' to 'regulation'. Moreover, the title now stipulates that the repealed acts in
question are part of the Schengen acquis.
The Regulation repeals:
11 decisions of the Schengen Executive Committee because their content has been taken up in successive acts. These concern: visa
policy; exchange of statistical information; issuance of Schengen visas; evidence under readmission agreements; task force;
difficulties on obtaining laissez-passer; stamping of passports; fight against illegal immigration; fight against illegal immigration;
document advisers; liaison officers; and
Council Regulation (EC) No 189/2008 of 18 February 2008 on the tests of the second generation Schengen Information System (SIS
II) which exhausted its legal effect once the SIS II became operational on 9 April 2013.
An amendment stipulates that the Denmark is not bound by Regulation or subject to its application, but that it shall decide, in accordance with
Protocol No 22 annexed to the Treaties, decide within a period of six months after the Council has decided on this Regulation whether it will
implement it in its national law.

2014/0337(COD) - 20/01/2016 Final act
PURPOSE: to repeal a number of obsolete Union acts belonging to the Schengen acquis.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Regulation (EU) 2016/93 of the European Parliament and of the Council repealing certain acts from the Schengen acquis.
CONTENT: in the context of the better law-making strategy that the institutions of the Union are implementing, the Regulation repeals a
number of acts belonging to the Schengen acquis which are no longer relevant due to their temporary nature or because their content has
been taken up by successive acts.

policy; (ii) exchange of statistical information; (iii) issuance of Schengen visas; (iv) evidence under readmission agreements; (v) task force; (vi)
difficulties on obtaining laissez-passer; (vii) stamping of passports; (viii) fight against illegal immigration (two Decisions); (ix) document

Council Regulation (EC) No 189/2008 of 18 February 2008 on the tests of the second generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) which
exhausted its legal effect once the SIS II became operational on 9 April 2013.
This Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis in which the United Kingdom and Ireland do not take part.
These two countries are therefore not taking part in its adoption and is not bound by it or subject to its application.
Denmark is not bound by Regulation or subject to its application, but that it shall decide, in accordance with Protocol No 22 annexed to the
Treaties, decide within a period of six months after the Council has decided on this Regulation whether it will implement it in its national law.
