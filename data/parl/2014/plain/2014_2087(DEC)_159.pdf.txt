prepared on the basis of the information presented by the institutions, organisations and bodies of the EU, in accordance with Article 129 (2) of
the Financial Regulation applicable to the EU's General Budget, including the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training
(CEDEFOP).
The document contains the figures on which the discharge procedure is based.
Discharge procedure of the EU agencies: the EU Budget finances a wide range of policies and programmes throughout the EU. In accordance

a budgetary and accrual accounting perspective.
The consolidated reports on the implementation of the general budget of the EU include the budget implementation of all Institutions. Agencies
do not have a separate budget inside the EU budget; and they are partially financed by a Commission budget subsidy.
Each agency is subject to its own discharge procedure.

2014/2087(DEC) - 30/03/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Ryszard CZARNECKI (ECR, PL) on discharge in respect of the implementation of
the budget of the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (ECDVT) for the financial year 2013.

The committee recommended that the European Parliament grant the Director of the Centre discharge in respect of the implementation of the
Centres budget for the financial year 2013.
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the Centre for the financial
year 2013 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Members called on the Parliament to approve the closure of
the Centres accounts. They made, however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is
granted, in addition to the general recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of
EU agencies.
Centres financial statements: Members noted that the final budget of CEDEFOP for the financial year 2013 was EUR 17 925 075,
representing a decrease of 6.72% compared to 2012. The overall contribution of the Union to the Centre's budget for 2013 amounted
to EUR 17 133 900.
Commitments and carry-overs: Members noted that budget monitoring efforts during the financial year 2013 resulted in a budget
implementation rate of 98.95% and that the payment appropriations execution rate was 92.39 %, due to savings and postponement of
recruitment. They also noted a clear reduction in carryovers.
Members noted that the Centre had finally developed processes to monitor and report on legality and regularity and was currently deploying its
own anti-fraud strategy. They welcomed the exemplary measures taken by the Centre with regard to cost-effective and environment-friendly
solutions and encouraged it to maintain good practice.

2014/2087(DEC) - 29/04/2015 Final act
PURPOSE: to grant discharge to the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (CEDEFOP) for the financial year 2013.
NON LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision (EU) 2015/1639 of the European Parliament on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of
the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training for the financial year 2013.
CONTENT: with the present decision, the European Parliament grants discharge to the Director of the European Centre for the Development
of Vocational Training for the implementation of the latters budget for the financial year 2013.
This decision is in line with the European Parliament's resolution adopted on 29 April 2015 and comprises a series of observations that form
an integral part of the discharge decision (please refer to the summary of the opinion of 29 April 2015).
Amongst Parliaments main observations, the latter noted with regret that the repair works on the Centre's building continued to be delayed but
welcomed the exemplary measures taken by the Centre with regard to environment-friendly solutions.
