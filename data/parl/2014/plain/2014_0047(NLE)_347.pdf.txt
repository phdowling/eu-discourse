2014/0047(NLE) - 17/02/2014 Initial legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude an Agreement on the participation of Croatia in the European Economic Area and the related Protocol, to take account
of the accession of Croatia to the European Union.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: the Agreement on the European Economic Area was signed on 2 May 1992 and entered into force on 1 January 1994.
The attached proposal creates the legal instrument for the conclusion of the Agreement on the participation of Croatia in the EEA and of the

related Additional Protocol to the Agreement between Norway and the European Union on a Norwegian Financial Mechanism for the period
2009-2014 consequent to the participation of Croatia in the European Economic Area to take account of the accession of Croatia to the
European Union.
On 4 September 2012, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway to amend the EEA
Agreement and the Agreement between the Norway and the European Union on a Norwegian Financial Mechanism for the period 2009-2014.
The negotiations with Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway were successfully concluded by the initialling of:
the Agreement;
the Protocol; and
two additional protocols, namely: (a) the Additional Protocol to the Agreement between the European Economic Community and
Iceland consequent to the accession of Croatia to the European Union; and (b) the Additional Protocol to the Agreement between the
European Economic Community and Norway consequent to the accession of Croatia to the European Union.
These two additional protocols are part of a package with the current Agreement and Protocol but are contained in two separate proposals.
LEGAL BASIS: Article 217 in conjunction with Article 218(6) and the second subparagraph of Article 218(8) of the Treaty on the Functioning of
the European Union (TFEU) and the Act of Accession of Croatia.
CONTENT: under this proposal, the Council is invited to adopt a decision aiming to approve, on behalf of the European Union and its Member
States, the Agreement on the participation of Croatia in the European Economic Area and the related Additional Protocol to the Agreement
between Norway and the European Union on a Norwegian Financial Mechanism for the period 2009-2014 consequent to the participation of
Croatia in the European Economic Area, to take account of the accession of Croatia to the European Union.
The text of the Protocol is attached to the proposal.
The proposed Agreement makes Croatia a contracting party to the EEA Agreement and commits the EU to providing an authentic version of
the EEA Agreement in the new official language of the EU. The Protocol includes Croatia in the Norwegian Financial Mechanism.
The provisional application of the Agreement and the Protocol is envisaged as of the date stipulated by an exchange of letters between the
Parties, pending the completion of the relevant procedures for its formal conclusion and entry into force.

2014/0047(NLE) - 11/03/2014 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude an Agreement on the participation of Croatia in the European Economic Area and the related Protocol, to take account
of the accession of Croatia to the European Union.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent.
BACKGROUND: the Agreement on the European Economic Area was signed on 2 May 1992 and entered into force on 1 January 1994.
In accordance with the Act of Accession of Croatia, that country undertook to become a party to the EEA Agreement.
This proposal is the legal instrument for the conclusion of the Agreement on the participation of Croatia in the EEA. The Agreement and three
additional related protocols:
the Additional Protocol to the Agreement between Norway and the European Union on a Norwegian Financial Mechanism for the
period 2009-2014 consequent to the participation of Croatia in the European Economic Area ;
the Additional Protocol to the Agreement between the European Economic Community and Iceland consequent to the accession of
Croatia to the European Union;
the Additional Protocol to the Agreement between the European Economic Community and Norway consequent to the accession of
Croatia to the European Union were signed by the Union, in accordance with a Council decision, subject to their conclusion.
The Agreement and the related Protocols should be concluded, on behalf of the European Union.
LEGAL BASIS: Article 217 in conjunction with Article 218(6) and the second subparagraph of Article 218(8) of the Treaty on the Functioning of
the European Union (TFEU) and the Act of Accession of Croatia.
CONTENT: under this proposal, the Council is invited to adopt a decision aiming to approve, on behalf of the European Union and its Member
States, the Agreement on the participation of Croatia in the European Economic Area and the related Additional Protocol to the Agreement
between Norway and the European Union on a Norwegian Financial Mechanism for the period 2009-2014 consequent to the participation of
Croatia in the European Economic Area, to take account of the accession of Croatia to the European Union.
The text of the Agreement is attached to the proposal.
The President of the Council shall, on behalf of the Union, deposit the instruments of approval provided for in the Agreement and each of the
related Protocols. The content of the agreement is identical to that of the Commissions proposal (please refer to the summary dated
17/02/2014 of the initial legislative proposal).

2014/0047(NLE) - 12/11/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on International Trade adopted the report by Alexander GRAF LAMBSDORFF (ADLE, DE) on the draft Council decision on the
conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of an Agreement on the participation of Croatia in the European Economic Area, and of three
related agreements.
Members recalled that the EEA Agreement brings together the EU Member States and the three members of the European Free Trade

Association - Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway - in a single market. It provides for the inclusion of EU legislation covering the four freedoms
(free movement of goods, services, persons and capital) throughout all the EEA States. In addition, the Agreement guarantees equal rights
and obligations within the internal market for citizens and economic operators in the EEA.
Members consider that the participation of Croatia in the European Economic Area is a natural consequence of its EU accession. Therefore,
Members recommended that the European Parliament give its consent to the conclusion of the Agreement on the participation of Croatia in the
EEA as well as the three related additional protocols.

2014/0047(NLE) - 16/12/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 622 votes to 31, with 51 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the draft Council decision on the
conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of an Agreement on the participation of the Republic of Croatia in the European Economic Area,
and of three related agreements.
Parliament gave its consent to the conclusion of the Agreement and of the three related agreements.
