Summary

The European Parliament adopted by 476 votes to 109 with 49 abstentions a resolution on the persecution of the democratic opposition in
Venezuela.
The resolution was tabled by the EPP, ECR, ALDE, and S&D groups.
It strongly condemned the political persecution and repression of the democratic opposition, the violations of freedom of expression and of
demonstration, and the existence of media and web censorship.
Citing the detention of opposition leader Leopoldo LÃ³pez and student leader Sairam Rivas, Parliament also deplored the lack of judicial
impartiality and guarantees and the imprisonment of peaceful protesters, students and opposition congressmen who were facing investigations
and trial proceedings. It recalled its demand for an ad hoc European Parliament delegation to be sent to assess the situation in Venezuela and
hold a dialogue with all sectors involved in the conflict, as soon as possible.
The EEAS, the EU Delegation, and the HR/VP as well as Member States were asked to:
continue to observe the investigations and the trial hearings of opposition leaders;
call for the immediate release of the protesters who have been arbitrarily arrested since the start of the protests;
Members asked the Government of Venezuela to enter into a strong and open dialogue on human rights with the European Union, and to:
immediately disarm and dissolve the uncontrolled armed pro-government associations and groups, putting an end to their impunity;
withdraw the unfounded charges and arrest warrants against opposition politicians and to ensure the security of all citizens in the
country, regardless of their political views or affiliations;
comply with its own constitution and its international obligations with respect to the independence of the judiciary, the rights of freedom
of expression, association and peaceful assembly and political pluralism;
conduct effective investigations into alleged human rights violations, and enable an environment in which human rights defenders and
independent non-governmental organisations might carry out their legitimate work of promoting human rights and democracy.
