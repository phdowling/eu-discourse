Summary

2014/2600(RSP) - 27/02/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 463 votes to 45 with 37 abstentions a resolution on the situation in Venezuela.
The resolution was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ALDE, and ECR groups. It condemned all acts of violence and the tragic loss of life during the

peaceful demonstrations led by students on 12 February 2014 and subsequently, which have ended in deadly violence, with at least 13 deaths
and more than 70 people being injured and hundreds detained. Noting that political tension and polarisation was increasing in Venezuela, and
that the Venezuelan authorities, instead of contributing to the maintenance of peace and calm, had threatened to conduct an armed revolution,
Parliament called on the representatives of all parties and sections of Venezuelan society to remain calm in both actions and words. Members
wanted an ad hoc European Parliament delegation to be sent to assess the situation in Venezuela as soon as possible.
They note that the students demands related to the failure of President Maduros government to solve the problems of high inflation, crime and
shortages of some staples, as well as to increasing levels of corruption and the intimidation of the media and the democratic opposition, whilst
the government had blamed the shortages on saboteurs and profit-hungry corrupt businessmen.
Parliament reminded the Venezuelan Government that freedom of expression and the right to participate in peaceful demonstrations are
recognised in the Venezuelan Constitution, and that the latter had an obligation to ensure the security of all citizens in the country, regardless
of their political views and affiliations. It called on the Venezuelan authorities to withdraw the unfounded accusations and arrest warrants
against opposition leaders, and to dissolve the uncontrolled armed pro-government groups that had been acting with impunity in Venezuela for
a long time, and had been accused by the opposition of inciting violence during the peaceful demonstrations, causing deaths and several
injuries.
Members called on the Venezuelan Government for clarification regarding the deaths that have occurred so that the perpetrators are held
accountable for their actions.
Parliament regretted the existence of media and web censorship and the fact that access to some blogs and social networks was limited,
condemning the harassment suffered by a number of newspapers and other audiovisual media outlets. It regarded these practices as contrary
to the Venezuelan Constitution and the undertakings given by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.
