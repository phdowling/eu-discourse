2014/2106(DEC) - 01/07/2014 Court of Auditors: opinion, report
PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the European Aviation Safety Agency for the year 2013,
together with the Agencys reply.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit concerned, amongst others, the annual accounts of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).
Statement of assurance: pursuant to the provisions of Article 287 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the Court
has audited:
the annual accounts of the Agency, which comprise the financial statements and the reports on the implementation of the budget for
the financial year ended 31 December 2013;
the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying those accounts.
Opinion on the reliability of the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the Agencys annual accounts present fairly, in all material respects, its
financial position as at 31 December 2013 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the
provisions of its Financial Regulation and the accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
Opinion on the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the transactions underlying the annual
accounts for the year ended 31 December 2013 are legal and regular in all material respects.
The Courts observations:
legality and regularity of transactions: in 2012 EASA selected 14 National Aviation Authorities and 10 Qualified Entities through
procurement procedures to outsource part of its certification activities. Expenditure for such outsourced certification activities

amounted to some EUR 22 million in 2013. The Court considered that the transparency of outsourcing could be improved. This is also
the case for the allocation of the many other low-value contracts to bidders;
budgetary management: although the Agency reduced further the overall level of carry-overs of committed appropriations from EUR
10.1 million (11%) in 2012 to EUR 7.2 million (8%) in 2013, carry-overs of committed appropriations were high at EUR 3.4 million
(42%). Although this is partly justified by the multiannual nature of the Agencys operations and the carry-overs included in the Courts
sample were duly justified, such a high level is at odds with the budgetary principle of annuality;
headquarters: the Agency became operational in 2004 and has, to date, worked on the basis of correspondence and exchanges with
the host Member State. However, a comprehensive headquarters agreement between the Agency and the Member State has not
been signed. Such an agreement would promote transparency in respect of the conditions under which the Agency and its staff
operate.
The Agencys replies:
legality and regularity of transactions: in the frame of a better control of the certification activities outsourced to National Aviation
Authorities and potentially qualified entities, the certification directorate together with the finance directorate will implement in 2014 a
simple means to record that the selection of the provider for any given outsourcing purchase order has been made and optimised in
accordance with certain criteria;
budgetary management: the Agency highlighted that great efforts have already been made to reduce the level of operational
expenditure carryovers and this is already reflected in the significant decrease compared to the previous year (EUR 6.2 million in 2012
compared to EUR 3.4 million in 2013);
headquarters: having already experienced some unclarities concerning relations with the host state due to the absence of a proper
seat agreement, the EASA will work closely with the EU Council, Parliament and Commission, to establish a proper headquarters
agreement. Such agreement should ensure that the host State takes all necessary measures to facilitate the unimpeded exercise by
the Agency of its legal mandate.
Lastly, the Court of Auditors report contains a summary of the Agencys activities in 2013. This is focused on the following:
Budget: EUR 151.2 million of which the Union subsidy is 23.1%.
Activities:
opinions and rulemaking decisions in particular in the area of certification and compliance;
modifications of Appendices to a Working Arrangement;
notices of proposed amendments;
international cooperation including rulemaking cooperation arrangements with EASA bilateral partners;
bilateral aviation safety agreements;
certification decisions;
standardisation inspections in the field of airworthiness, operations, flight crew licensing.

2014/2106(DEC) - 30/07/2014 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: presentation by the Commission of the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2013, as part of
the 2013 discharge procedure.
Analysis of the accounts of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).
CONTENT: this Commission document sets out the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2013 as
prepared on the basis of the information presented by the institutions, organisations and bodies of the EU, in accordance with Article 129 (2) of
the Financial Regulation applicable to the EU's General Budget, including the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).
The document contains the figures on which the discharge procedure is based.
Discharge procedure of the EU agencies: the EU Budget finances a wide range of policies and programmes throughout the EU. In accordance
with the priorities set by the European Parliament and the Council in the multi-annual financial framework (MFF), the European Commission
carries out specific programmes, activities and projects in the field with the technical support of some specialised agencies.
The consolidated annual accounts of the EU provide information on the activities of the institutions, agencies and other bodies of the EU from
a budgetary and accrual accounting perspective.
The consolidated reports on the implementation of the general budget of the EU include the budget implementation of all Institutions. Agencies
do not have a separate budget inside the EU budget; and they are partially financed by a Commission budget subsidy.
Each agency is subject to its own discharge procedure.
EASA: in 2013, the tasks and budget of this agency were as follows:
description of EASA's tasks: EASA, which is located in Cologne, was established by Regulation (EC) No 1592/2002 of the European
Parliament and of the Council and its role is to maintain a high uniform level of civil aviation safety in Europe and to ensure the proper
development of civil aviation safety. It shall issue opinions and recommendations to the Commission and take decisions in this area;
EASA's budget for the 2013 financial year: the Agencys budget for 2013, as presented in the Commission document on the
consolidated annual accounts of the European Union, gives the following figures:
§

Commitment appropriations :
- committed : EUR 169 million;
- paid : EUR 135 million;
- carried-over : EUR 32 million.

§

Payment appropriations :
- committed : EUR 180 million;
- paid : EUR 125 million;
- carried-over : EUR 52 million.

Please refer also to the final accounts of the EASA.

2014/2106(DEC) - 30/03/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Ryszard CZARNECKI (ECR, PL) on discharge in respect of the implementation of
the budget of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) for the financial year 2013.
The committee recommended that the European Parliament grant the Executive Director of the Agency discharge in respect of the
implementation of the Agencys budget for the financial year 2013.
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the Agency for the financial
year 2013 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Members called on the Parliament to approve the closure of
the Agencys accounts. They made, however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is
granted, in addition to the general recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of
EU agencies.
Agencys financial statements: Members noted that the final budget of the Agency for the financial year 2013 was EUR 167 023 535,
representing an increase of 5.15% compared to 2012. The overall contribution of the Union to the Agency's budget for 2013 amounted
to EUR 40 518 135.
Commitments and carry-overs: Members noted a general reduction of the overall level of committed appropriations carried over from
EUR 10 100 000 (11 %) in 2012 to EUR 7 200 000 (8 %) in 2013. They were concerned that although the general level of carry-overs
had reduced, it remained high for operational expenditure, amounting to 42 %. They stressed that although the multiannual nature of
the Agency's operations partly justified the carry-overs, such a high level was at odds with the budgetary principle of annuality.
Members also made a series of observations on procurement and recruitment procedures, internal controls and internal audits and the
prevention and management of conflicts of interest.
Regarding the legality and regularity of transactions, the committee noted that in 2013, the Agency spent some EUR 22 000 000 on
procurement procedures to outsource part of its certification activities to National Aviation Authorities and Qualified Entities. However, the
transparency of outsourcing should be improved through the improved documentation of the allocation processes , including assessments
made on the basis of the criteria set in the guidelines.
On the issue of conflicts of interest, Members observed with concern that this issue was extremely relevant with regards to the members of the
panel of experts who are called to test and authorise the products. They expressed deep concern about the two revolving door cases identified
by the Agency in 2013 and recommends that the Agency further strengthen its independence policy, especially in publishing the CVs and
declarations of interests of the panel of experts by the end of September 2015. They called upon the Agency to adopt comprehensive policies
for the management of situations where conflicts of interests arise, such as the rearrangement of the public official's duties or the resignation
of the public official from their office.
Lastly, Members noted that since 2004, when the Agency became operational, it had been working on the basis of correspondence and
exchanges with the host Member State but that a comprehensive headquarters agreement had not yet been signed with the host Member
State. Such an agreement would promote transparency in respect of the conditions under which the Agency and its staff operated.

2014/2106(DEC) - 29/04/2015 Final act
PURPOSE: to grant discharge to the European Aviation Safety Agency in respect of the Agencys budget for the financial year 2013.
NON LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision (EU) 2015/1643 of the European Parliament on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of
the European Aviation Safety Agency for the financial year 2013.
CONTENT: with the present decision, the European Parliament grants discharge to the Executive Director of the European Aviation Safety
Agency for the implementation of its budget for the financial year 2013.
This decision is in line with the European Parliament's resolution adopted on 29 April 2015 and comprises a series of observations that form
an integral part of the discharge decision (please refer to the summary of the opinion of 29 April 2015).
Amongst Parliaments main recommendations, it calls on the Agency to improve the transparency of outsourcing through the improved
documentation of the allocation processes of certification tasks, since this issue involved reservations on the legality and regularity of its
operations, as expressed by the Court of Auditors.

2014/2106(DEC) - 29/04/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 553 votes to 105, with 30 abstentions, a decision to grant discharge to the Executive Director of the
European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) for the financial year 2013. The vote on the discharge decision approved the closure of the accounts
(in accordance with Annex VI, Article 5(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament.
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the Agency for the financial

year 2013 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Parliament adopted by 579 votes to 74, with 38 abstentions,
a resolution containing a number of recommendations that form an integral part of the discharge decision and as well as the general
recommendations that appear in the resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies:
Agencys financial statements: Parliament noted that the final budget of the Agency for the financial year 2013 was EUR 167 023 535,

agreement would promote transparency in respect of the conditions under which the Agency and its staff operated.
Lastly, Parliament highlighted the Agencys vital role in ensuring the highest possible level of aviation safety throughout Europe. It called for the
Agency to be given the necessary financial, material and human resources to perform its tasks successfully.
