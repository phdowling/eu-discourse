2014/0151(NLE) - 23/05/2014 Initial legislative proposal
PURPOSE: conclude an agreement between the European Union and its Member States and Iceland concerning Iceland's participation in the
second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change entered into force on 16 February 2005
and contains legally binding emission reduction commitments for its first commitment period, from 2008 to 2012, for Parties listed in its Annex
B. The Union and the Member States ratified the Protocol on 31 May 2002, and agreed to fulfil its commitments under the first commitment
period jointly.
Iceland ratified the Protocol on 23 May 2002.
At the Doha Climate Conference in December 2012, all Parties to the Protocol agreed on the Doha Amendment which establishes a second
commitment period of the Protocol (starting on 1 January 2013 and ending on 31 December 2020). The Doha Amendment amends Annex B of
the Protocol, setting out further legally-binding mitigation commitments for Parties listed in that Annex for the second commitment period, and
amending and further elaborates provisions on the implementation of Parties? commitments during the second commitment period.
The Union, the Member States and Iceland also issued a joint declaration upon the adoption of the Doha Amendment, expressing their
intention to fulfil their commitments in the second commitment period jointly . The declaration was agreed in December 2012.
The agreement concerning Iceland's participation in the joint fulfilment of commitments by the Union, the Member States and Iceland in the
second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol should now be formally concluded on behalf of the European Union.
CONTENT: the Council is called upon to conclude the agreement concerning Iceland's participation in the joint fulfilment of commitments by
the European Union, its Member States and Iceland in the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol is hereby concluded on behalf of
the Union.
Purpose of the agreement: the agreement with Iceland sets out the terms governing Iceland's participation in the joint fulfilment of
commitments by the Union, its Member States and Iceland.
It does not establish any obligations for the Union or its Member States.
Iceland's participation in the joint fulfilment: Iceland's participates in the joint fulfilment on the same basis as that of the Member States.
Iceland's emission level, identical to its assigned amount, will relate to Iceland's emissions from gases and sectors covered under the Kyoto
Protocol's second commitment period but that are not covered under the EU's greenhouse gas emissions trading system (Directive
2003/87/EC7).
Application of relevant EU legislation to Iceland: as Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, the Union and the Member States are subject to a number of
monitoring, reporting and verification requirements under the Kyoto Protocol. For Parties that have agreed to fulfil their commitments jointly,
some of this information needs to be submitted jointly. As a consequence, the Commission will require information from Iceland to enable the
Union to fulfil its reporting commitments.
Moreover, Iceland will need to participate in the registry system of the Union and its Member States that are relevant for the fulfilment of
obligations under the Kyoto Protocol. This requires Iceland to apply Union legislation that is not applicable to third countries (including the
Parties to the European Economic Area), especially in relation to the monitoring, reporting and verification of emissions as well as with regard
to the operation of a registry and the accounting for transactions related to the implementation of commitments of the Union, its Member States
and Iceland in the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol in line with the terms of joint fulfilment and the internationally agreed rules.
The agreement contains a list of Union legislation that shall be binding upon Iceland. It also provides for a procedure to amend this list, to
ensure that Iceland's participation in the joint fulfilment and follows the same rules and responsibilities as that of Member States, in line with
internationally agreed requirements.
The agreement also provides for the establishment of a Joint Fulfilment Committee, which ensures the effective implementation and operation
of the agreement.
Duration and termination of the agreement with Iceland: the draft agreement with Iceland is concluded for a limited time period, until all matters
related to the implementation of the second commitment period will have been completed.
In case of a breach by Iceland, or objection by Iceland to amend the list of legal acts with application in Iceland according to this agreement,
Iceland will be individually responsible to account for all of its greenhouse gas emissions covered by the Kyoto Protocol, including those under
the scope of the EU's greenhouse gas emissions trading system.
Ratification: pursuing the rapid entry into force of the Doha Amendment, before the United Nations climate conference in Paris at the end of
2015, which is to adopt a new legally binding instrument for the period after 2020, the Member States and Iceland will seek to ratify both the
Doha Amendment and the agreement concerning Iceland's participation in the joint fulfilment of commitments by the Union, the Member
States and Iceland in the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol not later than February 2015.

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.

BACKGROUND: the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change entered into force on 16 February 2005
and contains legally binding emission reduction commitments for its first commitment period, from 2008 to 2012, for Parties listed in its Annex

At the Doha Climate Conference in December 2012, all parties to the Kyoto Protocol agreed on the Doha Amendment which establishes a
second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, starting on 1 January 2013 and ending on 31 December 2020. The Doha Amendment
amends Annex B of the Kyoto Protocol, sets out further legally binding mitigation commitments for parties listed in that Annex for the second
commitment period, amends and further elaborates on provisions concerning the implementation of parties' commitments during the second
commitment period.
The Union, its Member States and Iceland expressed their intention, in December 2012, to fulfil their commitments for the second commitment
period jointly.
In order to pursue the rapid entry into force of the Doha Amendment, before the United Nations climate conference in Paris at the end of 2015,
which is to adopt a new legally binding instrument for the period after 2020, and to underline the commitment of the Union, its Member States
and Iceland to enable the legal force of the second commitment period in a timely manner, the Union, the Member States and Iceland should
endeavour to ratify both the Doha Amendment and the Agreement not later than the third quarter of 2015.
It is now necessary for the Agreement to be approved on behalf of the Union.
CONTENT: this proposed Decision seeks the consent, on behalf of the European Union, of the Agreement between the European Union and
its Member States, of the one part, and Iceland, of the other part, concerning Iceland's participation in the joint fulfilment of commitments by
the European Union, its Member States and Iceland for the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change.

2014/0151(NLE) - 18/05/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety adopted the report by Giovanni La VIA (EPP, IT) on the draft Council
decision on the conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, on the
one part, and Iceland, on the other part, concerning Iceland's participation in the joint fulfilment of commitments of the European Union, its
Member States and Iceland for the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change.
The committee recommended that the European Parliament give its consent to the conclusion of the Agreement.
The Doha amendment establishes a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol (KP CP2), starting on 1 January 2013 and ending
on 31 December 2020, with legally binding emission reduction commitments according to which the European Union, its Member States and
Iceland are jointly committed to limit their average annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the years 2013 to 2020 to 80% of their base
year emissions (mostly 1990). That commitment was determined on the basis of the total greenhouse gas emissions allowed during the period
2013-2020 under the EU Climate and Energy Package.
Iceland is an Annex I Party to the Kyoto Protocol which met its individual target for the first commitment period. Iceland's emissions have finally
decreased by a 2% average over this period.
In 2009, Iceland expressed its intention to jointly fulfil its commitments in a second commitment period together with the EU and its Member
States. The Council welcomed this request and concluded that joint fulfilment in the second commitment period should include Iceland.
Iceland is interested in joint fulfilment with the EU and its Member States irrespective of whether it joins the EU or not.
Committee members considered that the Agreement will send a strong signal about the coordinated European efforts to address climate
change at international level.
Members believed that the two Council Decisions on the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol and the participation of Iceland in the joint
fulfilment of commitments to the Kyoto Protocol need to be ratified in parallel without unnecessary delays and certainly well before the Paris
UNFCCC Conference in 2015.

2014/0151(NLE) - 10/06/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 626 votes to 63, with 10 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the draft Council decision on the

Iceland, of the other part, concerning Iceland's participation in the joint fulfilment of commitments of the European Union, its Member States
and Iceland for the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
Parliament gave its consent to conclusion of the Agreement.
