2014/2225(BUD) - 27/11/2014 Commission draft budget
PURPOSE: to present the Draft Amending Budget No 2 for the year 2014.
CONTENT: on 15 April 2014, the Commission presented the Draft Amending Budget No 2/2014, which was intended to budget the surplus
resulting from the implementation of the budget year 2013.
On 17 July 2014, the Council completed its reading of the Draft Amending Budget, and on 22 October 2014 the European Parliament voted its
reading.
As the European Parliament adopted amendments to the Draft Amending Budget, which could not be accepted by the Council, a Conciliation
Committee was convened, in accordance with Article 314 §4(c) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
The Conciliation Committee worked over a period of twenty-one days, between 28 October and 17 November 2014. However, it was not
possible to reconcile the positions of the European Parliament and Council on the package of outstanding Draft Amending Budgets for 2014
(DAB 2-7) as well as on the 2015 budget, within the time period allowed, mostly due to a difference of opinion between the European
Parliament and the Council on the outstanding payment needs for 2014 as reflected in the increase in payment appropriations requested in
Draft Amending Budget 3/2014.
Although there was no disagreement on the calculation of the surplus itself and its treatment in a separate amending budget, as set out in
Article 18 of the Financial Regulation, DAB No 2 was part of the overall 'package' under negotiation in the Conciliation Committee. That is why
the Commission presents again, in line with Article 314(8) TFEU, the same amending budget (as Draft Amending Budget No 8/2014), to be
adopted by the budgetary authority as part of a package which includes all outstanding amending budgets for 2014.
To recall, the present Draft Amending Budget No 2/2014 is intended to budget the surplus resulting from the implementation of the budget year
2013. It shows a surplus of EUR 1.005 billion, which is therefore entered as revenue in the 2014 budget.
The budgeting of the surplus will diminish accordingly the global contribution of the Member States to the financing of the EU Budget.

2014/2225(BUD) - 12/12/2014 Council position on draft budget
On 28 November 2014, the Commission submitted to the Council draft amending budget (DAB) No 8 to the general budget for 2014
concerning the budgeting of the surplus of EUR 1 005 406 925.37 resulting from the implementation of the budget year 2013..
The budgeting of this surplus will diminish accordingly the global contribution of Member States to the financing of the EU budget.
Draft budget: at the trilogue on 8 December 2014, the European Parliament and the Council reached an ad referendum agreement on a draft
package, comprising the new draft budget for 2015 and the outstanding DABs relating to 2014.

According to that agreement, DAB No 8/2014 is approved as proposed by the Commission.
In conclusion, on 12 December 2014, the Council adopted its position on DAB No 8/2014, by accepting the Commission proposal without any
changes.

2014/2225(BUD) - 15/12/2014 Budgetary report tabled for plenary, 1st reading
The Committee on Budgets adopted the report by Gérard DEPREZ (ADLE, BE) on the Council position on Draft amending budget No 8/2014
of the European Union for the financial year 2014, Section III Commission.
Members recalled that this DAB was presented by the Commission because the Conciliation Committee could not reach an agreement on
Draft amending budget No 2/2014, which had the exact same purpose and content as DAB No 8/2014 (that is to enter in the 2014 budget the
surplus from the 2013 financial year, amounting to EUR 1 005 million).
They stated that the Council had approved in its reading of 17 July 2014, while the Parliament had introduced an amendment to it in its
position in order to maintain its political and procedural link with DABs No 3/2014, 4/2014, 5/2014, 6/2014 and 7/2014.
Blocking of DAB No 2/2014: Members pointed out that the Conciliation Committee could not reach an agreement on the adoption of DAB No
2/2014 because of the differences in positions between the Parliament and the Council on the outstanding payment needs for 2014 and the
package of DABs No 2 -7/2014, and not on the contents of DAB No 2/2014 per se.
Therefore, Members called on the Parliament to approve the Council position on Draft amending budget No 8/2014.

2014/2225(BUD) - 17/12/2014 Final act
PURPOSE: definitive adoption of Amending budget No 7/2014.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Definitive adoption (EU, Euratom) 2015/371 of Amending budget No 7 of the European Union for the financial year 2014.
CONTENT: the European Parliament definitively adopted amending budget No 7 of the European Union for the financial year 2014 in
accordance with its resolution of 17 December 2014 (please see the summary of the resolution).
This amending budget enters in the 2014 budget the surplus from the 2013 financial year, amounting to EUR 1 005 406 925.37.
The budgeting of the surplus will diminish accordingly the global contribution of Member States to the financing of the EU budget (new
breakdown of contributions from Member States to the EU budget, recalculated with the reduction of this surplus).

2014/2225(BUD) - 17/12/2014 Budgetary text adopted by Parliament
The European Parliament adopted by 620 votes to 39, with 43 abstentions, a resolution on the Council position on Draft amending budget No
8/2014 of the European Union for the financial year 2014, Section III Commission.
Parliament recalled that this DAB was presented by the Commission because the Conciliation Committee could not reach an agreement on
Draft amending budget No 2/2014, which had the exact same purpose and content as DAB No 8/2014 (that is to enter in the 2014 budget the
surplus from the 2013 financial year, amounting to EUR 1 005 million).
It stated that the Council had approved in its reading of 17 July 2014, while the Parliament had introduced an amendment to it in its position in
order to maintain its political and procedural link with DABs No 3/2014, 4/2014, 5/2014, 6/2014 and 7/2014.
Blocking of DAB No 2/2014: Parliament pointed out that the Conciliation Committee could not reach an agreement on the adoption of DAB No
2/2014 because of the differences in positions between the Parliament and the Council on the outstanding payment needs for 2014 and the
package of DABs No 2 -7/2014, and not on the contents of DAB No 2/2014 per se.
Lastly, Parliament recalled that the adoption of this DAB No 8/2014 will reduce the share of the GNI contribution from Member States to the
Union budget by EUR 1 005 million and will therefore partly compensate for their contribution to the financing of DABs No 3, 5 and 7/2014.
