2014/0079(NLE) - 10/03/2014 Initial legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude an Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of the Seychelles on access for fishing vessels flying
the flag of the Seychelles to waters and marine biological resources of Mayotte, under the jurisdiction of the European Union.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: in the course of the negotiations for a new protocol to the EU-Seychelles Fisheries Partnership Agreement, held in May 2013,
the Seychelles raised the need of negotiating an access agreement for Seychelles flagged vessels to the waters of Mayotte, which will fall
under the jurisdiction of the EU from 1 January 2014. This would enable Seychelles flagged vessels to continue to have access to Mayotte
waters from 1 January 2014.

Seychelles flagged vessels can currently fish in Mayotte waters on the basis of an agreement between the Prefet de Mayotte and the
Seychelles flagged vessels owners.
A mandate for the Commission to undertake these negotiations was agreed on 14 October and negotiations were held with the Seychelles
shortly following this and concluded on 15 November 2013.
The Agreement should now be concluded on behalf of the EU.
CONTENT: the proposal calls on the Council to approve on behalf of the Union the Agreement with Seychelles on access for fishing vessels
flying the flag of the Seychelles to waters and marine biological resources of Mayotte, under the jurisdiction of the EU.
Administrative framework and fees : in order for the authorities in Mayotte to implement the rules of the common fisheries policy, from the date
on which Mayotte becomes an outermost region (1 January 2014), it is necessary to set in place :
the appropriate administrative framework,
control activities,
physical infrastructure and
the appropriate capacity building
Therefore, the necessary financial means will be provided to the fisheries authorities in Mayotte through the use of the funding provided
through the shipowners fees to be paid directly to Mayotte. All payments related to authorisations and catches under the agreement will
directly benefit the local community in Mayotte.
France shall be empowered to collect, for the account of its outermost region Mayotte, the payments related to authorisations and catches and
other fees due by operators of Seychelles vessels in consideration of the granting of access to fisheries within EU waters around Mayotte.
These receipts shall be used by France for the setting in place of the appropriate administrative framework mentioned above in order for the
administration in Mayotte to meet the requirements of the CFP.
Joint committee: the Agreement established a Joint Committee responsible for monitoring the application of the Agreement. In order to
facilitate the approval of modifications, it is appropriate to empower the Commission, subject to specific conditions, to approve them under a
simplified procedure.

2014/0079(NLE) - 03/04/2014 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude the Agreement between the European Union and the Seychelles on access for fishing vessels flying the flag of the
Seychelles to waters and marine biological resources of Mayotte, under the jurisdiction of the European Union.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: on 11 July 2012, the European Council adopted Decision 2012/419/EU1 amending, with effect from 1 January 2014, the
status of Mayotte with regard to the European Union. From that date, Mayotte ceased to be an overseas country or territory and became an
outermost region of the Union within the meaning of Article 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
The Council authorised the Commission to negotiate, on behalf of the Union, an agreement with the Seychelles relating to the access, for
fishing vessels flying the flag of Seychelles, to waters and marine biological resources of the Union in the exclusive economic zone off the
coast of Mayotte.
The Agreement between the European Union and the Seychelles on access for fishing vessels flying the flag of the Seychelles to waters and
marine biological resources of Mayotte, under the jurisdiction of the European Union was signed in accordance with a Council Decision and is
provisionally applied.
In order for the authorities in Mayotte to implement the rules of the common fisheries policy (CFP) from the date on which Mayotte becomes
an outermost region, it is necessary to set up the appropriate administrative framework, control activities and physical infrastructure, and to
provide the appropriate capacity building.
The Agreement should be approved on behalf of the EU.
CONTENT : the proposal calls on the council to approve, on behalf of the EU, an Agreement with the Seychelles on access for fishing vessels
flying the flag of the Seychelles to waters and marine biological resources of Mayotte, under the jurisdiction of the European Union.
For the contents of the Agreement, please refer to the summary of the Commissions initial legislative proposal dated 10/03/2014.
Simplified procedure: the Agreement established a Joint Committee responsible for monitoring its application. The Joint Committee may
approve certain modifications to the Agreement. In order to facilitate the approval of such modifications, the Commission is empowered,
subject to specific conditions, to approve them under a simplified procedure.
The modifications relate to the following issues:
reassessment and adjustment of fishing opportunities in accordance with the Agreement;
revision of the technical provisions of the Agreement and the Annex, including a review of the technical rules on VMS in accordance
with the Annex to the Agreement.

2014/0079(NLE) - 08/12/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Fisheries adopted the report by Alain CADEC (EPP, FR) on the draft Council decision on the conclusion, on behalf of the

European Union, of the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of the Seychelles on access for fishing vessels flying the
flag of the Seychelles to waters and marine biological resources of Mayotte, under the jurisdiction of the European Union.
The committee recommended that the European Parliament gave its approval to the conclusion of the Agreement.
The current agreement, the first of its kind, was an access agreement signed between the Republic of the Seychelles and the European Union
on 3 April 2014. It concerned access by Seychelles-flagged vessels to the waters and biological resources of Mayotte, which acquired the
status of an outermost region of the European Union on 1 January 2014. As a result Mayottes exclusive economic zone (EEZ) now belonged
to EU waters.
This access agreement allowed a limited number of Seychelles-flagged vessels that had a tradition of fishing in Mayottes waters to continue to
fish in Mayottes EEZ with due regard for the rules of the common fisheries policy.
Members wished to give a favourable opinion on this agreement as it benefitted both parties, it was beneficial for the economic development of
Mayotte and the Seychelles and it complied with the rules of the common fisheries policy and the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) as
regards preservation of resources.

2014/0079(NLE) - 13/01/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 628 votes to 41, with 18 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the draft Council decision on the
conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Agreement between the European Union and the Seychelles on access for fishing vessels
flying the flag of the Seychelles to waters and marine biological resources of Mayotte, under the jurisdiction of the European Union.
The European Parliament gave its consent to the conclusion of the Agreement.

other fees due by operators of fishing vessels flying the flag of the Seychelles in consideration of the granting of access to waters and marine
biological resources within Union waters off the coast of Mayotte Those revenues shall be used by France for the setting up of the appropriate
administrative framework, control activities, physical infrastructure and for the provision of the appropriate capacity building in order for the
administration in Mayotte to meet the requirements of the CFP.
The Agreement set up a Joint committee which will oversee its application and in accordance with its terms, the Joint Committee may make
certain amendments to the Agreement.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 16.2.2015.
