2014/0275(COD) - 26/09/2014 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to codify Council Regulation (EC) No 1506/98 suspending certain concessions relating to the import into the Union of agricultural
products originating in Turkey.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the Council and the European Parliament.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 1506/98 has been substantially amended. It is recalled that on 1 April 1987, the Commission
decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement.
The Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this, stressing the importance of codification.
The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an
accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments.
CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and rationality, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No
1506/98 of 13 July 1998 establishing a concession in the form of a Community tariff quota for Turkey in 1998 in respect of hazelnuts and
suspending certain concessions.
The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it; it fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does
no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself.
Main provisions codified: under the Agreement establishing an Association between the European Economic Community and Turkey,
concessions were granted to that country in respect of certain agricultural products.

Decision No 1/98 of the EC-Turkey Association Council provides for the improvement and consolidation of trade preferences relating to the
import into the Union of agricultural products originating in Turkey and establishes a series of preferential concessions for Union exports of
meat and live animals to Turkey.
Turkey has since 1996 been applying a ban on the import of live animals of the bovine species and restrictions on the import of beef. Those
measures, being quantitative restrictions, are incompatible with the Agreement and prevent the Union from benefiting from the concessions
granted to it under Decision No 1/98 of the EC-Turkey Association Council.
As a result of those measures, exports to Turkey of the products in question originating in the Union are blocked.
Suspension of concessions: in order to protect the Union's commercial interests, the situation should be counterbalanced by means of
equivalent measures. The concessions set out in the Annex to this Regulation should therefore be suspended.
In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission.
Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council
(examination procedure).
It should be noted that the future Regulation shall repeal Regulation (EC) No 1506/98.

2014/0275(COD) - 05/12/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Legal Affairs adopted the report by Andrzej DUDA (ECR, PL) on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament
and of the Council suspending certain concessions relating to the import into the Union of agricultural products originating in Turkey (codified
text).
The committee recommended the European Parliament to adopt the Commission proposal as adapted to the recommendations of the
Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
According to the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, the proposal
in question contains a straightforward codification of the existing texts without any change in their substance.

2014/0275(COD) - 11/03/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 605 votes to 91, with 10 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council suspending certain concessions relating to the import into the Union of agricultural products
originating in Turkey (codified text).
Parliament adopted its position at first reading in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure taking over the Commission proposal, as
adapted to the recommendations of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the
Commission.
The Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, stated that the proposal in
question contains a straightforward codification of the existing texts without any change in their substance.
The proposal aims to suspend the concessions set out in Annex I to this Regulation .
In accordance with this Regulation, the Commission shall, by means of implementing acts, terminate the suspension once the barriers to
preferential exports from the Union to Turkey have been lifted.
Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure.

2014/0275(COD) - 29/04/2015 Final act
PURPOSE: to codify Council Regulation (EC) No 1506/98 suspending certain concessions relating to the import into the Union of agricultural
products originating in Turkey.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Regulation (EU) 2015/756 of the European Parliament and of the Council suspending certain concessions relating to the
