2014/2242(INI) - 17/12/2013 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: to propose a framework for action towards competitive and resource-efficient urban mobility.
BACKGROUND: mobility within cities is increasingly difficult and inefficient. Many European towns and cities suffer from chronic traffic
congestion, which is estimated to cost EUR 80 billion annually and account for some 23%, of all CO2 emissions from transport. Cities need to
make more efforts to turn past trends around and contribute to achieving the 60% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions called for by the
Commission's White Paper on transport.
A Eurobarometer survey (2013) on attitudes towards urban mobility shows that a strong majority of citizens considers congestion, the cost,
and the negative environmental and human health impacts of urban mobility and transport patterns to be important problems.
Against this background, this Communication aims to reinforce the support to European cities for tackling urban mobility challenges to ensure
a competitive and resource-efficient European transport system.
It is also crucial to overcome fragmented approaches and develop the single market for innovative urban mobility solutions by addressing
issues like common standards and specifications or joint procurement.
CONTENT: the strategy sets out actions to be implemented on two levels : (i) EU-level action to contribute to the joint effort; (ii) EU-wide action
involving Member States.
These actions are as follows:
Urban mobility plan: the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan concept proposes that action on urban mobility be embedded into a wider urban and
territorial strategy. Therefore, these Plans should be developed in cooperation across different policy areas and sectors (transport, land-use

and spatial planning, environment, economic development, social policy, health, road safety, etc.); across different levels of government and
administration; as well as with authorities in neighbouring areas both urban and rural.
In this area, Member States are called upon to:
-

conduct a careful assessment of the present and future performance of urban mobility in their territory;

-

develop an approach to urban mobility which ensures coordinated and mutually reinforcing action at national, regional and local
level;

-

review and amend where necessary the technical, policy-based, legal, financial, and other tools at the disposal of local planning
authorities;

-

adopt measures to avoid fragmented approaches to ensure continuity and compatibility of urban mobility measures.

The Commission, in turn, will set up, in 2014, a European Platform on Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans to coordinate EU cooperation on
developing the concept and tools further; provide a one-stop shop; and expand the present http://www.mobilityplans.eu/website into a virtual
knowledge and competence centre. It will also support national, regional and local authorities to develop and implement Sustainable Urban
Mobility Plans, through funding instruments.
Urban Logistics: in this area, Member States and urban authorities need to provide a framework (e.g. delivery spaces, access regulations,
enforcement etc.), to ensure that there is a business case for the private logistics operators to invest in new technologies and solutions. They
should also Creating platforms for cooperation, exchange of data and information, training, etc., for all actors of urban logistics chains.
The Commission will improve the dissemination and uptake of urban logistics best practice (2014) and prepare guidance documents that
provide practical assistance on how to improve urban logistics performance, e.g. by developing delivery and servicing plans, city logistics in
access regulation schemes etc. (2014-2016). It will also facilitate procurement of clean vehicles used for urban logistics by reviewing the scope
of the Clean Vehicle Portal18 (2015-2016).
Smarter urban access and road user charging: making urban centres as accessible as possible requires making choices about the use of
urban space. Loading and unloading spaces, bus lanes, cars, parking, pedestrian facilities, cycle lanes and parking all compete for urban road
space and cities have to manage these competing demands according to local priorities and circumstances. In this context, it is proposed to
conduct a thorough review of the effectiveness and impacts of existing and planned urban access regulation schemes and provide a
framework that allows local transport authorities to design, implement, and evaluate access regulation schemes, including urban road user
charging.
The Commission will foster an exchange with Member States and experts on urban access regulations across the Union.
Urban Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS): ITS help to optimise the use of existing infrastructure through a variety of means, such as traffic
signals, journey planners, smart ticketing or cooperative systems (including vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication
systems). Member States should use the Guidelines when key ITS applications are deployed in their conurbations and develop proper
interfaces between urban and surrounding interurban transport networks.
The Commission will facilitate the deployment of vehicle to vehicle and vehicle to infrastructure communication systems in urban areas.
Urban Road Safety: some 11 000 people die in road traffic in EU urban areas every year. The majority of fatal or serious road traffic crashes
involving vulnerable road users take place inside urban areas (involving mainly pedestrians and cyclists). Accordingly, Member States are
called upon to take account of issues like safe urban infrastructure, especially for vulnerable road users, the use of modern technology for
enhanced urban road safety, traffic rules enforcement, and road safety education. They are also asked to ensure proper gathering of data on
road safety indicators at the most detailed level possible.
The Commission will, during 2014-2015, gather and disseminate good practice examples for road safety planning and analyse measures for
reducing the number of serious road traffic injuries in urban areas.
Reinforce EU support: several measures are set out. Since its launch ten years ago, the Commission's CIVITAS Initiative has become an
engine of urban mobility innovation and made European cities key players in the innovation process. Today, the CIVITAS network of cities
counts over 200 member cities and covers virtually all Member States. The Commission intends to launch a reinvigorated CIVITAS 2020
Initiative under Horizon 2020. CIVITAS will continue to support local partnerships in implementing and testing new approaches under real-life
conditions on issues such as: tackling urban road congestion, reducing the use of conventionally-fuelled vehicles in urban areas, reducing
impacts and costs of urban freight, etc.
Launched in 2012, the Smart Cities Partnership looks to facilitate strategic partnerships between industry, European cities and other parties to
develop the urban systems and infrastructures of tomorrow. The initiative will foster closer cooperation across sectors like transport, energy,
and information and communication technologies.
Furthermore, the coming European Green Vehicles Initiative will provide a strengthened framework for supporting the development of clean,
safe and efficient urban vehicles for rail and road.
With respect to financial support, the Communication envisages mobilising the structural funds particularly in the EUs less developed regions,
as well as using the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESI-funds) for key policy objectives in transport in the period 2014-2020. The
Commission will also use the Connecting Europe Facility.
Lastly, it will upgrade its efforts to support sustainable urban mobility policies in its cooperation activities particularly with developing regions. In
addition, more efforts will be made to take advantage of existing EU partnerships with key partner countries and regions (e.g. with the
EuroMed countries, Brazil, Singapore, or China).

2014/2242(INI) - 13/11/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Transport and Tourism adopted the own-initiative report by Karima DELLI (Greens/EFA, FR) on sustainable urban mobility,
in response to the Commission communication on the same issue.

Estimates suggest that by 2050 up to 82 % of EU citizens will live in urban areas . The expected significant increase in urban population
confronts urban centres with societal, quality of life and sustainable development challenges, which will require holistic planning measures.
In this regard, the report made the following recommendations:
Giving space and infrastructure back to all citizens and improving accessibility: Members encouraged the authorities in the Member States to:
draw up sustainable urban mobility plans which give priority to low-emission transport modes, including electric traction and vehicles
powered by alternative fuels, and which include intelligent transport systems;
develop a parking policy (parking space supply, use of intelligent parking systems and appropriate pricing) which can be part of an
integrated urban policy;
take measures to reduce traffic-related noise in cities.
Members are convinced that the provision of information to, and the consultation of, EU citizens, retailers, freight transport operators and other
stakeholders involved in urban mobility are crucial in order to make planning, development, and decision-making more transparent. This
information should be publicly and easily accessible. Moreover, they pointed out that it is desirable to foster cooperation among the relevant
actors and between cities at EU level with a view to sharing sustainable mobility solutions.
Taking into account the need to reduce the negative impact on the environment of oil dependency in the EU transport system, the ESI funds
should be systematically used for the development and implementation of comprehensive, integrated Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans
(SUMPs).
Improving the environment, quality of life and health: the report encouraged the competent authorities to take preventive measures, in
accordance with the precautionary and proportionality principles, to improve air quality in towns and cities and to guarantee that pollutant
concentrations do not exceed the levels set in the World Health Organization guidelines. To that end, it supported local setting-up of
low-emission zones.
Pointing out that there is a need for a holistic approach to air pollution in European cities, Members called on the Commission to put forward
effective measures that enable the Member States to comply with the Ambient Air Quality Directive ( 2008/50/EC), notably:
by setting effective and ambitious emission ceilings for 2025 and 2030 under the National Emission Ceilings Directive (NEC),
by ensuring better coordination of measures under the NEC Directive and the Ambient Air Quality Directive,
by setting ambitious car emission performance standards for 2025 and 2030 in a timely review of the CO2 and cars Regulation (EC)
No 443/2009,
by setting a clear timeframe for the implementation of Real-World Driving Emission Testing for private vehicles.
The Commission should assess how society is likely to be affected by new forms of mobility based on the sharing-economy model, including
ride-sharing.
At national level, Member States should pursue the concept of a shareable city, where mobility and transport are concerned. They are invited
to:
promote public transport with the view to increasing its use by 2030;
support the development of innovative forms of mobility;
promote the use of non-motorises transport, including by setting ambitious targets for cycling rates by 2030 and to improve conditions
for walking and cycling.
Saving energy and protecting the climate: Members considered that energy efficiency and the use of low-carbon and renewable energy
sources are key to achieving sustainable urban mobility.
Member States are encouraged to support the goals of the Transport White Paper of halving the number of 'conventionally fuelled' cars in
urban transport by 2030 and of phasing them out in cities by 2050 .
Research policy aimed at smart mobility approaches: the Commission is asked to prioritise the development of innovative applications and
new technologies enabling road users to take a more proactive role as developers and data producers in the transport system, in order to
contribute to platforms for mobility services. They support the Horizon 2020 priorities regarding societal challenges for smart, green and
integrated transport and urban mobility, as well as the development of 'Mobility-as-a-Service' (Maas) initiatives across Europe.
The Commission is invited to develop policies to encourage the freight industry to green its fleet and to encourage local authorities to provide
support and/or incentives to operators to make urban freight transport more sustainable.
As regards the safety management, Member States and local authorities to use all modern solutions, including advanced intelligent traffic
management, to provide safety for all road users, including pedestrians. European cities are urged to exchange best practices regarding this
issue.
Minimising external costs and making better-quality investments: the report stressed that cost-benefit assessments of investments should be
directed to maximising external societal benefits and minimising external costs arising from, for example, climate change, accidents, health,
noise, air pollution and spatial use.
Members recalled the 'use of revenues principle with regard to road charging, and called for a proportion of revenue from the use of road
infrastructure (road charging and/or Eurovignette) to be dedicated to improving sustainable urban mobility. They insisted on the need to make
use of the new possibility of financing urban projects within the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) in urban nodes.
Integrating networks of efficient mobility systems and fostering cooperation: Members called on the Member States to promote multi-level
governance to foster cooperation between regional, national and European authorities in the development of policies, including in the design,
implementation and monitoring of urban policies that have a clear impact on urban areas.
The Commission and the Member States are invited to: (i) establish a Sustainable Mobility Network of best-practice examples of spatial
planning and space use; (ii) encourage cities to participate in the Smart Cities and Communities European Innovation Partnership; (iii) launch
public-awareness campaigns to promote mobility.

2014/2242(INI) - 02/12/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 483 votes to 32, with 37 abstentions, a resolution on sustainable urban mobility, in response to the
Commission communication on the same issue.
Estimates suggest that by 2050 up to 82 % of EU citizens will live in urban areas . The expected significant increase in urban population
confronts urban centres with societal, quality of life and sustainable development challenges, which will require holistic planning measures.
In this regard, Parliament made the following recommendations:
Giving space and infrastructure back to all citizens and improving accessibility: Members pointed out that land planning is the most important
phase for creating smooth and safe transportation networks. They emphasised the importance of Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMPs)
in achieving EU targets regarding CO2 emissions, noise, air pollution and accident reduction. Safety must always be viewed as a key element
of sustainable urban planning.
The resolution encouraged the authorities in the Member States to:
draw up sustainable urban mobility plans which give priority to low-emission transport modes, including electric traction and vehicles
powered by alternative fuels, and which include intelligent transport systems, taking in account special needs as regards
communications for persons with reduced mobility. The Commissions Platform on Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans should provide
strong support for cities and regions in the design and implementation of SUMPs;
develop a parking policy (parking space supply, use of intelligent parking systems and appropriate pricing) which can be part of an
integrated urban policy;
take measures to reduce traffic-related noise in cities.
Members are convinced that the provision of information to, and the consultation of, EU citizens, retailers, freight transport operators and other

Members welcomed initiatives at national, regional and local level to promote and organise 'EU Car-Free Sunday' and 'EU Bicycle Day' events
with a view to improving air quality in cities.
Saving energy and protecting the climate: Parliament considered that energy efficiency and the use of low-carbon and renewable energy
sources are key to achieving sustainable urban mobility. With the view to achieving the EU targets of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by
60 % by 2050, Member States are encouraged to support the goals of the Transport White Paper of halving the number of 'conventionally

Research policy aimed at smart and safe mobility approaches: in this regard, Parliament called on the Commission and the Member States to:
intensify efforts on intelligent transport systems, including innovation and implementation in the fields of provision of real-time travel
information, highly automated vehicles, smart infrastructure and intelligent traffic signal systems; r bring urban mobility into the focus of
the Digital Agenda;
prioritise the development of innovative applications and new technologies enabling road users to take a more proactive role as
developers and data producers in the transport system, in order to contribute to platforms for mobility services. Parliament supports
the Horizon 2020 priorities regarding societal challenges for smart, green and integrated transport and urban mobility, as well as the
development of 'Mobility-as-a-Service' (Maas) initiatives across Europe;
rethink speed management by 2020, taking into account local conditions, in order to ensure safety, inter alia in housing areas and
around schools and educational and social facilities;
develop policies to encourage the freight industry to green its fleet;

use all modern solutions, including advanced intelligent traffic management, to provide safety for all road users, including pedestrians.
European cities are urged to exchange best practices regarding this issue.
Minimising external costs and making better-quality investments: Parliament stressed that cost-benefit assessments of investments should be
