Summary

The European Parliament adopted a resolution on Syria: situation in certain vulnerable communities.
The text adopted in plenary was tabled as a joint resolution by the EPP, S&D, ALDE, Greens/EFA, ECR and EFD groups.
Profoundly dismayed at the suffering inflicted upon innocent victims by the Syrian conflict, Parliament strongly condemns the violations of
human rights and international humanitarian law by the Assad regime and by pro-government militia as well as the terrorist attacks carried out
by extremist organisations.
According to the Members, a lasting solution to the current crisis in Syria can only be achieved through a Syrian-led, inclusive political process,
with the backing of the international community. In this context, they deplore the fact that peace talks are currently failing and recall the crucial
role of minorities in this context.
Members at the same time condemn the recent attacks against certain religious and ethnic communities in Syria, notably the Christians,
Armenians and Kurds, and calls on all the parties involved to stop all actions aimed at inciting interethnic and interconfessional conflict. They
condemn in the strongest possible terms the killing of Father Frans Van der Lugt, an inhumane act of violence against a man who stood by the
people of Syria amid sieges and growing difficulties.
Parliament also condemns:
the attack against the Armenian town of Kassab (an Armenian town on the border between Syria and Turkey);
the treatment of Palestine refugees in Syria, and particularly the inhuman living conditions of Palestinians staying in Yarmouk Camp;
the treatment of female and child victims of the Syria crisis.
It also called for the urgent release of all political detainees, civil society activists, humanitarian aid workers, religious figures, journalists and
photographers held by the regime or by rebel fighters.
Parliament is concerned lastly about the continued refugee outflow affecting Jordan, Turkey, Iraq and Egypt. It encourages the European
Union and its Member States to continue providing substantial humanitarian assistance to the populations affected by the Syrian conflict.
