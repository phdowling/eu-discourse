2014/0340(NLE) - 30/06/2015 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to subject 4-methyl-5-(4methylphenyl)-4,5-dihydrooxazol-2-amine (4,4'-DMAR) and 1-cyclohexyl-4(1,2-diphenylethyl)piperazine
(MT-45) to control measures.
PROPOSED ACT: Implementing Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to
follow its opinion.
BACKGROUND: in compliance with Council Decision 2005/387/JHA on the information exchange, risk-assessment and control of new
psychoactive substances, the Scientific Committee of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) assessed the
risks on the new psychoactive substance 4,4'-DMAR and MT-45. The risk assessment reports were submitted to the Commission and to the
Council on 19 September 2014.
(1) 4,4'-DMAR is a synthetic substituted oxazoline derivative. It is a derivative of aminorex and 4-methylaminorex (4-MAR), two synthetic
stimulants controlled under the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances.
4,4'-DMAR has been available on the drugs market in the Union since at least December 2012 and was notified to the Early Warning System
in December 2012. Nine Member States have reported detections. It emerged on the new psychoactive substances market as a 'research
chemical' sold by internet retailers, and it is now available on the street market. 4,4'-DMAR is being sold and consumed as a substance on its
own, but it has also been mis-sold on the illicit market as ecstasy and amphetamines.
There have been 31 deaths associated with 4,4'-DMAR registered in three Member States, between June 2013 and June 2014.
Three Member States control 4,4'-DMAR under national legislation and five Member States use other legislative measures to control it.
(2) MT-45 is one of a series of 1-(1,2-diphenylethyl)piperazine analgesics invented in the early 1970s. It has been present on the drugs market
in the Union since October 2013, where it is sold as a 'research chemical', mostly on the internet.
One Member State controls MT-45 under national legislation and seven Member States use other legislative measures to control it. A total of
28 fatalities occurring between November 2013 and July 2014 have been reported by one Member State. There are several studies in animals
indicating that the acute toxicity of MT-45 is several fold higher than that of morphine. The substance appears to be mostly used in the home
environment either by users willing to try a new substance or by opioid dependent users with no access to heroin or any other opioid.
The Risk Assessment Reports reveal that there is limited scientific evidence available on 4,4'-DMAR and MT-45 and pointed out that further
research would be needed to determine the health and social risks that they pose.
However, the evidence and information currently available provides sufficient grounds for subjecting MT-45 to control measures across the
Union. As a result of the health risks that it poses, as documented by its detection in several fatalities, and of the lack of medical value of this
substance, MT-45 should be subjected to control measures.
CONTENT: this proposal aims to invite the Member States to subject 4,4'-DMAR and MT-45 to control measures across the Union.

By one year from the date of publication of this Decision, Member States shall take the necessary measures, in accordance with their national
law, to subject the new psychoactive substances to control measures and criminal penalties, as provided for under their legislation complying
with their obligations under the 1961 United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs and/or under the 1971 United Nations Convention
on Psychotropic Substances.
The United Kingdom shall not take part in the adoption of this Decision and is not bound by it or subject to its application.

2014/0340(NLE) - 28/09/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs adopted the report by Micha? BONI (EPP, PL) on the draft Council implementing
decision on subjecting 4-methyl-5-(4methylphenyl)-4,5-dihydrooxazol-2-amine (4,4'-DMAR) and 1-cyclohexyl-4(1,2-diphenylethyl)piperazine
(MT-45) to control measures.
The committee approved the Council draft which seeks to invite the Member States to subject 4,4'-DMAR and MT-45 to control measures.
In compliance with Council Decision 2005/387/JHA on the information exchange, risk-assessment and control of new psychoactive
substances, the Scientific Committee of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) assessed the risks on the
new psychoactive substances. The risk assessment report was subsequently submitted to the Commission and to the Council on 19
September 2014.

2014/0340(NLE) - 06/10/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 650 votes to 5, with 33 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the draft Council implementing decision
on subjecting 4-methyl-5-(4methylphenyl)-4,5-dihydrooxazol-2-amine (4,4'-DMAR) and 1-cyclohexyl-4(1,2-diphenylethyl)piperazine (MT-45) to
control measures.
In line with the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, the European Parliament approved the Council draft aiming to subject
4,4'-DMAR and MT-45 to control measures.

2014/0340(NLE) - 08/10/2015 Final act
PURPOSE: to subject 4-methyl-5-(4methylphenyl)-4,5-dihydrooxazol-2-amine (4,4'-DMAR) and 1-cyclohexyl-4(1,2-diphenylethyl)piperazine
(MT-45) to control measures.
NON-LEGISLATIVE
ACT:
Council
Implementing
Decision
(EU)
2015/1873
on
subjecting
4-methyl-5-(4-methylphenyl)-4,5-dihydrooxazol-2-amine (4,4?-DMAR) and 1-cyclohexyl-4-(1,2-diphenylethyl)piperazine (MT-45) to control
measures.
CONTENT: the Council adopted an implementing decision on subjecting the new psychoactive substance
4-methyl-5-(4methylphenyl)-4,5-dihydrooxazol-2-amine (4,4'-DMAR) and 1-cyclohexyl-4(1,2-diphenylethyl)piperazine (MT-45) to control
measures across the Union:
4,4?-DMAR, a synthetic substituted oxazoline derivative, sold and consumed as a substance on its own, but it has also been mis-sold
on the illicit market as ecstasy and amphetamines;
MT-45 is one of a series of 1-(1,2-diphenylethyl)piperazine analgesics invented in the early 1970s and has been present on the drugs
market in the Union since October 2013.
The implementing Decision implements Decision 2005/387/JHA that confers upon the Council implementing powers with a view to giving a
quick and expertise-based response at Union level to the emergence of new psychoactive substances detected and reported by the Member
States, by subjecting those substances to control measures across the Union.
A risk assessment report on the new psychoactive substance 4-methyl-5-(4-methylphenyl)-4,5-dihydrooxazol-2-amine (4,4?-DMAR) was
drawn up in accordance with Decision 2005/387/JHA by a special session of the extended Scientific Committee of the European Monitoring
Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA).
As a result of the health risks that it poses, as documented by its detection in several reported fatalities, of the fact that users may unknowingly
consume it, and of the lack of medical value or use, 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole should be subjected to control measures across the Union.
By 21 October 2016, Member States shall take the necessary measures, in accordance with their national law, to subject the new
psychoactive substances referred to in Article 1 to control measures and criminal penalties, as provided for under their legislation complying
with their obligations under the 1961 United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs and/or under the 1971 United Nations Convention
on Psychotropic Substances.
The United Kingdom is not bound by Decision 2005/387/JHA and is therefore not taking part in the adoption of this Decision, which
implements Decision 2005/387/JHA, and is not bound by it or subject to its application.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 21.10.2015.
