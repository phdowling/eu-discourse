2014/2145(INI) - 12/05/2015 Resolution/conclusions adopted by Council
The Council adopted conclusions on the in-depth reviews in the context of the Macroeconomic Imbalances Procedure (MIP). These reviews
are included in the country specific reports which analyse the economic policies for each of the Member States and of the euro area in the
framework of the European Semester.
In-depth reviews: the Council considered that the in-depth reviews are structured in an appropriate way and present a thorough analysis of the
imbalances in each of the Member States under review. It agreed with the Commission that:
16 of the examined Member States which are identified in Alert Mechanism Report 2015 (Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, Ireland, Spain,
France, Croatia, Italy, Hungary, the Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Finland, Sweden and the UK) are experiencing
macroeconomic imbalances of various natures and magnitudes;
excessive imbalances exist in 5 Member States (Bulgaria, France, Croatia, Italy, and Portugal), and the Commission's intention to
consider in May 2015 the policy measures of France and Croatia, taking into account the level of ambition of the National Reform
Programme.

The Council stressed the need for policy action and strong commitment to structural reforms in all Member States, in particular when they face
macroeconomic imbalances, especially if affecting the smooth functioning of the Economic and Monetary Union. It welcomed the
Commission's plans with regard to specific monitoring of the recommendations by the Council to the Member States with excessive
imbalances (Bulgaria France, Croatia, Italy and Portugal).
Specific monitoring will also apply to a number of euro area Member States with imbalances requiring decisive policy action (Ireland, Spain
and Slovenia). The Commission is invited to outline the concrete timing and content of such monitoring.
The Council recognised that a number of macro-economic imbalances are being corrected, but that there are still sizeable risks in certain
Member States. In particular:
large external liabilities make debtor countries vulnerable, and improvements in current account are not always sufficient to diminish
the stock of external debt.
strengthening export growth through further structural efforts remains a priority in order to achieve a sustainable and growth-friendly
rebalancing;
current account surpluses remain high in some Member States: these reflect to some extent weak domestic demand, which can be
partially linked to low levels of private and public sector investment;
high levels of private and government debt remain an important challenge in some countries, also in the context of low inflation and
moderate growth rates;
structural reforms are needed to enhance the growth potential and to tackle high unemployment, in particular among the youth and
long-term unemployed.
Country specific recommendations: the Council welcomed the overall progress made in addressing the 2014-15 Country Specific and the euro
area Recommendations.
Reform implementation has been uneven over policy areas and across countries and needs to be stepped up: further structural reforms in the
services, product and labour markets and responsible fiscal policies are needed in all Member States to strengthen and sustain the economic
recovery, correct harmful imbalances, achieve fiscal sustainability, improve the conditions for investment and reinforce the single market.
The Council stated that it is looking forward to the Commission's publication of the 2015-2016 Country Specific Recommendations in mid-May
to ensure the necessary in-depth multilateral discussions before their adoption by the Ecofin council.
Country-specific recommendations should focus on areas of macroeconomic significance where there is an urgent need for action, in order to
give these issues more visibility in the Member State's national political debate.

2014/2145(INI) - 17/06/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs adopted the own-initiative report by Pervenche BERÈS (S&D, FR) on the review of the
economic governance framework: stocktaking and challenges.
Whilst welcoming the Commission Communication of 28 November 2014 on the economic governance review, the committee stressed the fact
that the current economic governance framework needs to be implemented and where necessary improved to: (i) deliver fiscal stability, to
favour a proper debate on the overall assessment of the euro area as a whole allowing growth friendly fiscal responsibility; (ii) improve
economic convergence perspective of the euro area; (iii) address on an equal footing Member States' different economic and fiscal situations.
Members insisted that the current framework is complex and it suffers from a lack of ownership at national level and limited attention to the
international economic perspective and appropriate democratic accountability mechanism. They underlined the importance of simple and
transparent procedures for economic governance.
Best application of flexibility within the existing rules: the report welcomed the interpretative communication on flexibility within the existing
rules of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP). Members supported:
all the incentives proposed by the European Commission to finance the new European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI), mainly
by making national contributions to the fund fiscally neutral as regards to the attainment of the MTO and to the required fiscal
adjustment effort without modifying it in the preventive or the corrective arm of the Stability and Growth Pact;
the Commission's intention to refrain from launching an Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) if, only because of the additional
contribution to the EFSI, a Member State deficit goes slightly and temporarily beyond the 3% deficit limit;
that the Commission communication aims at clarifying the scope of the investment clause, allowing for a certain degree of temporary
flexibility in the preventive arm of the SGP, in the form of a temporary deviation from the Medium Term Objective (MTO), provided the
deviation does not lead to an excess over the 3% deficit reference value and an appropriate safety margin, to accommodate
investment programmes by the Member States.
Closer coordination, economic convergence and streamlining of the European Semester: the report urged the Commission to fully apply the
SGP and ensure its fair implementation. Members supported the Commission three-pillar strategy (growth-enhancing investments, fiscal
consolidation and structural reforms), presented in the AGS 2015 and asked to make it more concrete under the overall assessment of the
budgetary situation and prospects in the euro area and in the Country Specific Recommendations.
Members made the following recommendations:
streamline and reinforce the European Semester within the current legislative framework;
the Commission and the Council should better articulate the fiscal and macroeconomic frameworks to allow for earlier and more
consistent debate among all stakeholders taking into account: (i) the European interests served by these frameworks, (ii) the need to
increase convergence between euro area Member States, (iii) deliberation by national parliaments and the role of social partners or of
local authorities regarding the ownership of sustainable and socially balanced structural reforms;
the Annual Growth Survey (AGS) as well as the country-specific recommendations (CSR) must be better implemented and take into
account the assessment of the budgetary situation and prospects both in the euro area as a whole and in the individual Member
States;

the Country Specific Recommendations (CSRs) should be, where relevant, better coordinated with the Excessive Deficit Procedure
(EDP) recommendations so as to ensure consistency;
the elaboration, follow-up, support and monitoring of Country Specific Recommendations should be enhanced;
the Commission should take account, in its analyses all important factors, including real growth, inflation, long term public investment
and unemployment rates when evaluating the economic and fiscal situations of Member States.
Democratic accountability and challenges ahead: Members stressed that a major role must be played by institutions subject to democratic
accountability. They recalled the European Parliament's resolutions specifying that the creation of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM)
and of the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance ('Fiscal Compact') outside of the structure of the institutions of the Union
represents a setback to the political integration of the Union.
The stakeholders are invited to take into account the foreseeable future enlargement of the euro area and to explore all options to deepen and
strengthen the EMU, such as:
enhanced democratic accountability mechanisms at both the EU and national levels, whereby responsibilities must be assumed at the
level where decisions are taken and based on the adoption of convergence guidelines under co-decision;
formalising the scrutiny role of the European Parliament in the European Semester in an Inter-Institutional Agreement;
ensuring that all euro area National Parliaments follow each step of the European Semester process;
a social dimension aimed at preserving Europe's social market economy, respecting the right to collective bargaining;
a euro area fiscal capacity based on specific own-resources which should, in the framework of the Union budget with European
parliamentary control, assist Member States in the implementation of the agreed structural reforms;
increasing the resilience of the EMU to face economic shocks and emergencies directly connected to the monetary union;
the inclusion of the European Stability Mechanism and the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance (TSCG) in Union law.
Members recalled their request to develop options for a new legal framework for future macroeconomic adjustment programmes, replacing the
Troika, in order to increase the transparency and ownership of these programmes and ensure that all EU decisions are, where possible, taken
under the Community method.

2014/2145(INI) - 24/06/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 317 votes to 254, with 9 abstentions, a resolution on the review of the economic governance framework:
stocktaking and challenges.
An alternative motion for a resolution was rejected in plenary by 79 votes to 515, with 31 abstentions.
Parliament welcomed the Commission Communication of 28 November 2014 on the economic governance review. However, it insisted that
the current framework is complex and it suffers from a lack of ownership at national level and limited attention to the international economic
perspective and appropriate democratic accountability mechanism. It underlined the importance of simple and transparent procedures for
economic governance.
The current economic governance framework needs to be implemented and where necessary improved to:
deliver fiscal stability;
improve economic convergence perspective of the euro area;
address on an equal footing Member States' different economic and fiscal situations.
Members believe that the current economic situation with its fragile growth and high unemployment calls for urgent, comprehensive and
decisive measures in an holistic approach based on growth-friendly fiscal consolidation, structural reforms and boosting investment in order to
restore sustainable growth and competitiveness, to foster innovation and to fight unemployment.
Parliament agreed with Commissioner Thyssens statement that countries that provide high-quality jobs and better social protection and invest
in human capital are more resilient to economic crises. It called on the Commission to reflect this position as it moves forward in all of its
European semester policy and country-specific recommendations.
Best application of flexibility within the existing rules: Parliament welcomed the interpretative communication on flexibility within the existing
rules of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP). It supported:
all the incentives proposed by the European Commission to finance the new European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI), mainly
by making national contributions to the fund fiscally neutral as regards to the attainment of the MTO and to the required fiscal
adjustment effort without modifying it in the preventive or the corrective arm of the Stability and Growth Pact;
the Commission's intention to refrain from launching an Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) if, only because of the additional
contribution to the EFSI, a Member State deficit goes slightly and temporarily beyond the 3% deficit limit;
that the Commission communication aims at clarifying the scope of the investment clause, allowing for a certain degree of temporary
flexibility in the preventive arm of the SGP, in the form of a temporary deviation from the Medium Term Objective (MTO), provided the
deviation does not lead to an excess over the 3% deficit reference value and an appropriate safety margin, to accommodate
investment programmes by the Member States.
Parliament called for: (i) enhanced dialogue between the Commission and the Member States on the content and types of structural reforms
most appropriate and effective to be proposed by the Commission in the Country specific recommendations; (ii) greater economic and social
cohesion to be provided by strengthening the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund in order to preserve and create jobs with rights by
supporting measures to combat unemployment and poverty; (iii) the fight against long-term unemployment to be reflected in its policies and
country-specific recommendations.
Closer coordination, economic convergence and streamlining of the European Semester: Parliament urged the Commission to fully apply the
SGP and ensure its fair implementation.
It made the following recommendations:

streamline and reinforce the European Semester within the current legislative framework;
the Commission and the Council should better articulate the fiscal and macroeconomic frameworks to allow for earlier and more
consistent debate among all stakeholders taking into account: (i) the European interests served by these frameworks, (ii) the need to

completing the Banking Union step by step;
the inclusion of the European Stability Mechanism and the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance (TSCG) in Union law.
Parliament also recalled their request to develop options for a new legal framework for future macroeconomic adjustment programmes,
replacing the Troika, in order to increase the transparency and ownership of these programmes and ensure that all EU decisions are, where
