2014/0032(COD) - 11/02/2014 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to ensure a harmonised approach to trade in breeding animals and their germinal products and their imports into the Union and to
the official controls necessary to be performed on breeding programmes carried out by breed societies and breeding operations.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: the breeding of domestic animals of the bovine, porcine, ovine, caprine and equine species, and to a lesser extent the
breeding of animals of other species, occupy an important place in Union agriculture and is a source of income for the agricultural community.
The breeding of animals of those species is best encouraged if purebred breeding animals or hybrid breeding pigs of recorded high genetic
quality are used.
Member States have thus consistently endeavoured, as part of their agricultural policy, to promote, sometimes through public investment, the
production of livestock of particular genetic characteristic that meets defined performance standards. Disparities between those standards
have the potential to create technical barriers to trade in breeding animals and their germinal products and their imports into the Union.
At present Union zootechnical legislation consists of four species specific (vertical) basic acts laying down the fundamental principles,
concerning breeding animals of the bovine, porcine, ovine, caprine and equine species. Technical requirements of identical nature for
acceptance of breeding animals for breeding are currently regulated in three Council Directives and a Commission Decision.

A horizontal Directive, complemented by implementing measures, provides rules on imports from third countries of breeding animals and their
germinal products.
Lastly, a specific Council Decision provides rules on the designation of a reference centre for breeding of bovine animals.
CONTENT: the proposed regulation provides in a single legal framework the principles relating to:
the approval or recognition and listing of breeding organisations, breeders associations and private undertakings,
the registration and classification of animals in herd-books, flock-books, studbooks and, in the case of hybrid breeding pigs in
registers,
performance testing and genetic evaluation,
the content and format of zootechnical certificates for breeding animals and their semen, ova and embryos.
In addition, the proposal provides rules on imports from third countries of breeding animals, their semen, ova and embryos, and the
designation of reference centres for breeding of animals.
Provisions are laid down in this Regulation to carry out official controls and zootechnical checks and to resolve disputes arising where
zootechnical checks disclose non-compliance with zootechnical requirements.
However, the rules hereby proposed mirror those laid down in the Commission proposal for a new Regulation on official controls that is
currently discussed in the European Parliament and in the Council. The Commission will closely follow the evolution of the discussions on the
two texts, and will make the necessary proposals in due time in order to ensure that the provisions on official controls in the field of
zootechnics are included in the forthcoming Regulation on official controls.
DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of
the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

2014/0032(COD) - 12/10/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development adopted the report by Michel DANTIN (EPP, FR) on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council on the zootechnical and genealogical conditions for trade in and imports into the Union of breeding
animals and their germinal products.
The committee recommended that the European Parliaments position at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure should
amend the Commission proposal as follows:
Subject matter and scope: Members underlined the key role breeding plays in conserving rare breeds and thereby in protecting biodiversity.
However, efforts to achieve competitiveness should not lead to the disappearance of breeds with characteristics that are adapted to specific
biophysical contexts.
Therefore, the Regulation should lay down zootechnical and genealogical rules for the preservation and improvement of animal breeding as
well as rules governing the conservation and improvement of native or endangered breeds.
For reasons of legal certainty, Members proposed a definition of the concept of breed.
Recognition of breed societies and breeding operations: Members proposed to clarify the legal framework for Member State recognition of
breed societies. Operators must be required to make an application for recognition in order to keep a breeding book and conduct a breeding
programme.
The competent authority shall define in its application: (i) the preservation of genetic variation within the breed, (ii) the improvement of the
breed, (iii) the planning of crosses, or (iv) the planning of a new breed.
The competent authority shall assess the breeding programmes of a breed society or breeding operation and approve them provided that they
fulfil the necessary requirements.
Rights of breeders participating in breeding programmes: Members seek to clarify breeders rights where they are members of a breed society
or breeding operation. Specifically, such rights must be reserved for breeders within the geographical area of activity of the breed society.
Breeders must have access to the services provided under the programme without discrimination.
Provisions on disputes between one or more breeders and a breed society already exist in national legislation.
Rights of breed societies and breeding operations: breed societies or breeding operations may exclude: (i) breeders from participating in a
breeding programme if they do not comply with the rules set out in the breeding programme or with the obligations as laid down in the rules of
procedure referred to in the Regulation; (ii) after their registration, animals and their progeny as well as genetic material that no longer meet
the requirements officially laid down for being listed in the corresponding breeding book.
Breed societies may carry out performance testing based on the requirements of their breeding programme and, where performance testing is
undertaken, may select activities appropriate for their breeding programme.
Breed societies and breeding operations in a Member State shall be jointly responsible for ensuring that a purebred breeding animal of a breed
threatened with extinction can be entered in the main section of a breeding book in any Member State.
Zootechnical and genealogical rules applicable to purebred breeding animals for breeding: Members deleted provisions concerning this issue,
arguing that there are far too many delegated acts, and they are far too broad in scope and relate to key aspects of the text. Furthermore,
other species must be incorporated into this regulation only on the basis of codecision arrangements.
Methods for identity verification: breed societies shall require that purebred breeding animals of the bovine, ovine and caprine species and
male purebred breeding animals of the porcine species are identified by analysis of their blood group, or by DNA analysis, such as by single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis, by microsatellite analysis or by any other appropriate method providing at least the same degree of
certainty.

The Commission shall take account of advances in identification methods on the basis of the work of the International Committee for Animal
Recording (ICAR) and the International Society for Animal Genetics (ISAG).
In the case of rare or endangered breeds, the competent authority of a Member State or the breed societies may prohibit the use of a purebred
breeding animal and its germinal products where such use would compromise the improvement, differentiation, preservation and genetic
diversity of that breed.
Performance testing: Members noted that the conditions should be stipulated for carrying out performance testing and genetic evaluation prior
to accepting breeding animals for breeding (both male and female, as may be the case for some breeds within the horse family).
Obligations of breed societies, breeding operations and third parties which carry out performance testing or genetic evaluations have also
been laid out.
If the competent authorities find that the performance testing or genetic evaluations are not being carried out in accordance with recognised
zootechnical principles, they may suspend the approved breeding programme.
Cross-border cooperation between breed societies and breeding operations: this cooperation should be facilitated, while ensuring free
enterprise and the removal of obstacles to the free movement of breeding animals and their genetic material. Members considered that such
Union partnership arrangements would help in particular to strengthen the Union identity of particular breeds by sharing resources and pooling
information with a view to greater reliability and a higher profile.
Animal health and welfare: these aspects should be taken into account by actors in the zootechnical sector, in particular in their work on the
genetic improvement of breeds. The report noted that issues relating to cloning should not be addressed in this Regulation.

2014/0032(COD) - 12/04/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 620 votes to 64, with 31 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council on the zootechnical and genealogical conditions for trade in and imports into the Union of breeding
animals and their germinal products.
The European Parliaments position at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure amended the Commission proposal as follows:
Subject matter and scope: Parliament clarified that the Regulation lays down:
·

zootechnical and genealogical rules for trade in breeding animals and their germinal products, and for their entry into the Union;

·

rules for the recognition of breed societies and breeding operations and for the approval of their breeding programmes;

·

the rights and obligations of breeders, breed societies and breeding operations;

·

rules for the entry of breeding animals in breeding books and breeding registers and for the acceptance for breeding of breeding
animals and their germinal products;

·

rules for the performance testing and genetic evaluation of breeding animals;

·

rules for the issuing of zootechnical certificates for breeding animals and their germinal products;

·

rules for the performance of official controls, and in particular those on breed societies and breeding operations, and rules for the
performance of other official activities;

·

rules for administrative assistance and cooperation and rules for enforcement by Member States;

·

rules for the performance of controls by the Commission in Member States and third countries.

This Regulation applies to breeding animals and their germinal products where those animals or the offspring resulting from those germinal
products are intended to be entered as purebred breeding animals in a breeding book or registered as hybrid breeding pigs in a breeding
register.
The definition of the term breed has been introduced in the text.
The text stated that it is not appropriate for issues relating to cloning to be addressed in this Regulation.
Recognition of breed societies and breeding operations: in respect of purebred breeding animals, breeders' associations, breeding
organisations or public bodies may apply to the competent authorities for recognition as a breed society. The competent authorities shall
evaluate the applications and recognise as a breed society any applicant who complies with the requirements.
Where the competent authority which has recognised a breed society or breeding operation refuses to approve a breeding programme
submitted by that breed society or breeding operation, that breed society or breeding operation shall have the possibility of submitting a
modified version of that breeding programme within six months after that refusal.
The competent authority shall withdraw recognition from that breed society or breeding operation if no modified version of the breeding
programme has been submitted.
Approval of breeding programmes: a breed society or a breeding operation shall submit applications for approval of its breeding programmes
to the competent authority which has recognised that breed society or breeding operation.
The competent authority shall evaluate those breeding programmes and approve them provided that they have one or more of the following
aims:
·

in the case of purebred breeding animals: (i) the improvement of the breed; (ii) the preservation of the breed; (iii) the creation of a
new breed; (iv) the reconstruction of a breed;

·

in the case of hybrid breeding pigs: (i) the improvement of the breed, line or cross; (ii) the creation of a new breed, line or cross.

Derogation: the competent authority which has recognised a breed society may refuse to approve a breeding programme of that breed society
that complies with the requirements set out and additionally in the case of purebred breeding animals of the equine species, on the grounds
that that breeding programme would compromise the breeding programme carried out by another breed society for the same breed which has
already been approved in that Member State as regards at least one of the following:
·

the preservation of that breed or of the genetic diversity within that breed; or

·

where the aim of that breeding programme is the preservation of that breed, the effective implementation of that breeding
programme: (i) in the case of an endangered breed; or (ii) in the case of an autochthonous breed which is not commonly found in
one or more of the territories of the Union.

Rights of breeders: Members clarified the right of breeders participating in breeding programmes approved provided that:
·

their breeding animals are kept on holdings located within the geographical territory of that breeding programme;

·

their breeding animals belong, in the case of purebred breeding animals, to the breed, or, in the case of hybrid breeding pigs, to the
breed, line or cross, covered by that breeding programme.

Breeders must have access to the services provided under the programme without discrimination
Rights and obligations of breed societies: breed societies or breeding operations shall have the right to exclude breeders from participating in
a breeding programme where those breeders fail to comply with the rules of that breeding programme.
Breed societies may carry out performance testing based on the requirements of their breeding programme.
Breed societies or breeding operations may outsource to a third party specific technical activities related to the management of their breeding
programmes, including performance testing and genetic evaluations.
Verification of identification methods: a Member State or, if it so decides, its competent authority may authorise a breed society to enter
purebred breeding animals of the equine species in the breeding book maintained by that breed society where those animals are identified by
any other appropriate method that provides at least the same degree of certainty as a covering certificate such as parentage control based on
DNA analysis or analysis of their blood groups.
In addition, in order to provide support to breed societies managing endangered breeds, where there is a recognised need, implementing
powers should be conferred on the Commission, enabling it to designate European Union reference centres charged with the specific task of
promoting the establishment or harmonisation of methods used by those breed societies.
Zootechnical certificates: breeders who are participating in a breeding programme should have the right to receive zootechnical certificates for
their breeding animals covered by that breeding programme and for the germinal products of those animals.
Zootechnical certificates should accompany breeding animals or the germinal products thereof where they are traded or entered into the Union
in view of an entry or registration of those animals or of the progeny produced from those germinal products in other breeding books or
breeding registers. Members laid down the rules as regards issuing, content and form of the zootechnical certificates.
Cross-border cooperation between breed societies and between breeding operations: this cooperation should be facilitated, while ensuring
free entrepreneurship and the removal of obstacles to the free movement of breeding animals and their germinal products.

2014/0032(COD) - 08/06/2016 Final act
PURPOSE: to ensure a harmonised approach to trade in breeding animals and their germinal products and their imports into the Union and to
the official controls necessary to be performed on breeding programmes carried out by breed societies and breeding operations.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Regulation (EU) 2016/1012 of the European Parliament and of the Council on zootechnical and genealogical conditions
for the breeding, trade in and entry into the Union of purebred breeding animals, hybrid breeding pigs and the germinal products thereof and
amending Regulation (EU) No 652/2014, Council Directives 89/608/EEC and 90/425/EEC and repealing certain acts in the area of animal
breeding (Animal Breeding Regulation)
CONTENT: the Regulation establishes new rules on the conditions applicable to breeding, trade in and entry into the Union of breeding
animals, and their germinal products. It will apply to the breeding, trade in and entry into the Union of pureblood animals of the bovine, porcine,
ovine, caprine and equine species and hybrid breeding pigs and their germinal products.
The new Regulation constitutes a more comprehensive single legal framework that takes into account the state of the art in animal breeding
while preserving valuable animal genetic resources. It does not deal with issues relating to cloning
The revised rules relate in particular to the following aspects:
The approval or recognition and listing of breeding organisations: breeders associations and organisations and private undertakings, may
apply to the competent authorities for recognition as a breed society.
The competent authorities shall evaluate the applications and recognise as a breeding operation any applicant that complies with the
requirements set out.
Where the competent authority which has recognised a breed society refuses to approve a breeding programme submitted by that breed
society, the latter shall have the possibility of submitting a modified version of that breeding programme within 6 months after that refusal. If no
modified version of the breeding programme has been submitted, the competent authority shall withdraw recognition.
Approval of breeding programmes: the competent authority shall evaluate breeding programmes submitted by a breed society or a breeding
operation and approve them provided that:
·

in the case of purebred breeding animals: (i) the improvement of the breed; (ii) the preservation of the breed, (iii) the creation of a
new breed, (iv) the reconstruction of a breed;

·

in the case of hybrid breeding pigs: (i) the improvement of the breed, line or cross, (ii) the creation of a new breed, line or cross.

However, where in a Member State one or more recognised breed societies are already carrying out an approved breeding programme on a
given breed, the competent authority of that Member State should, in certain specific cases, be allowed to refuse to approve a further breeding
programme for the same breed, even if that breeding programme complies with all the requirements necessary for approval.
Where there is a recognised need to maintain or promote the development of a breed on a certain territory, or in the case of an endangered
breed, the competent authority should itself have the possibility to carry out, on a temporary basis, a breeding programme for that breed,
provided that no breeding programme is already effectively in place for that breed.
Rights and obligations of breeders, breed societies and breeding operations: breeders shall have the right to participate in an approved
breeding programme provided that:
·

their breeding animals are kept on holdings located within the geographical territory of that breeding programme;

·

their breeding animals belong, in the case of purebred breeding animals, to the breed, or, in the case of hybrid breeding pigs, to the
breed, line or cross, covered by that breeding programme.

·

breed societies and breeding operations shall have the right: (i) to define and carry out approved breeding programmes
autonomously; (ii) exclude breeders from participating in a breeding programme where those breeders fail to comply with the rules of
that breeding programme; (iii) settle disputes that may arise between breeders, and between breeders and the breed society or
breeding operation, in the process of carrying out approved breeding programmes.

In addition, the new Regulation contains provisions on:
·

the entry in breeding books or registration in breeding registers of breeding animals and offspring produced from germinal products
that have entered the Union;

·

performance testing and genetic evaluation of breeding animals;

·

the content and format of zootechnical certificates: breeders who are participating in a breeding programme have the right to receive
zootechnical certificates for their breeding animals covered by that breeding programme and for the germinal products of those
animals;

·

official controls adapted to the breeding sector;

·

administrative assistance and cooperation and rules for enforcement by Member States;

·

the performance of controls by the Commission in Member States and third countries.

In order to provide support to breed societies managing endangered breeds, where there is a recognised need, implementing powers are
conferred on the Commission, enabling it to designate European Union reference centres charged with the specific task of promoting the
establishment or harmonisation of methods used by those breed societies.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 19.7.2016. The Regulation is applicable from 1.11.2018.
DELEGATED ACTS: the Commission may adopt delegated acts particular in order to supplement or amend the Annexes to the Regulation
and in order to take account of technical developments, scientific advances or the need to preserve valuable genetic resources. The power to
adopt such acts is conferred on the Commission for a period of five years from 19 July 2016 (which may be tacitly extended for the same
period). The European Parliament or Council may raise objections to a delegated act within two months of the date of notification (which may
be extended by three months). If Parliament or Council raise objections, the delegated act may not enter into force.
