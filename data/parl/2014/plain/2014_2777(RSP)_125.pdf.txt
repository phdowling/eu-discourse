Summary

2014/2777(RSP) - 26/11/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a resolution on the 2014 UN Climate Change Conference COP 20 in Lima, Peru (1-12 December 2014).
The resolution adopted in plenary was tabled by the Committee on Environment, Public health and Food Safety.
According to the scientific evidence presented in the 2014 Working Group reports on the 5th Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), warming of the climate system is unequivocal. Global greenhouse gas emissions over the period from 2000
to 2010 were the highest in human history. Without significant global mitigation action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, global average
temperature is likely to be as much as 5 °C higher by the end of the century .
Urgent need to act: Parliament recognises the extraordinary scale and seriousness of the threats induced by climate change and expressed
profound concern about the continued weakness of the international response to the challenge it poses. It called for the following measures:
(1) by adopting, at the climate conference in Paris in December 2015 (COP 21), an ambitious, legally binding international agreement for
post-2020 climate action which is commensurate with the 2 °C objective, while respecting the right to equitable and sustainable development.
Parliament underlined the need for an effective compliance regime applicable to all Parties under the 2015 Agreement;
(2) urgent strengthening and broadening of the measures in place to limit GHG emissions until 2020 and beyond;
(3) scaling up of developed countries funding for mitigation, adaptation, technology development and transfer and capacity building in
developing countries, in line with the creation of the Green Climate Fund and the commitment to provide new and additional such funding
amounting to USD 100 billion per year by 2020, while increasing official development aid in order to reach the long-since-pledged level of
0.7% of gross national income.
Climate diplomacy: Parliament expects the new Commission to assume a proactive role in addressing the global climate crisis and therefore
stressed the importance of the EU as a major player, speaking with one voice at the Conference in seeking progress towards an international
agreement and staying united in that regard.
Ambitious objectives: Parliament called for general reinvigoration of the EUs climate policy and for rapid agreement on ambitious, binding
targets for emission reduction, energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy sources, except socially and environmentally harmful
biofuels, by 2030, which would help build momentum in international climate discussions and are in line with the EUs commitment to reduce its
GHG emissions to 80%-95% below 1990 levels by 2050.
The resolution highlighted that Parliament has called on the Commission and the Member States to set a binding EU 2030 target of reducing
domestic greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% compared with 1990 levels, a binding EU 2030 energy efficiency target of 40%, in line
with research on cost-effective energy saving potential, and a binding EU 2030 target of producing at least 30% of total final energy
consumption from renewable energy sources. Member States are urged to take these targets into account in their ongoing discussions.
Developing countries: Parliament called on major developed economies to harness their existing advanced infrastructure to promote, enhance
and develop sustainable growth and to commit to supporting developing countries in building up their own capacity to ensure future economic
growth in all parts of the world is achieved at no further cost to the environment.
Members recalled that developing countries, in particular Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States, have contributed the
least to the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, but are the most vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate
change and have the least capacity to adapt. They called on all countries in a position to do so to support those countries that are the most

vulnerable in their efforts to adapt and respond to the impacts of climate change in order to achieve climate-resilient sustainable development
and to seek agreements on strengthening national adaptation planning processes, climate financing, technology transfer and capacity building.
Land sector, international aviation and maritime transport: Parliament stressed the importance for all Parties to include a land component in
their national contribution and called for the agreement to set out a comprehensive accounting framework for emissions and removals from
land.
Members also reiterated the importance of maritime and air transport in terms of GHG emission reductions, and the need for swift progress
and ambition in reaching satisfactory and timely outcomes on the part of both the International Maritime Organisation and the International
Civil Aviation Organisation.
Energy policy: Members welcomed recent signals from the US and Chinese governments regarding climate action and their willingness to play
a more significant role in global efforts to address climate change.
Parliament called on the EU and its partners to find, in the immediate future, the most effective way of promoting links between the EU ETS
and other trading schemes aiming for a global carbon market. It called on the Commission and the Member States to adopt without delay
concrete measures for progressively phasing out all environmentally harmful subsidies by 2020, including subsidies on fossil fuels.
European Parliament delegation: Parliament considered it unacceptable that Members of the European Parliament have been unable to attend
the EU coordination meetings at previous Conferences of the Parties. It expects at least the Chair of the European Parliament delegation to be
allowed to attend EU coordination meetings in Lima.
