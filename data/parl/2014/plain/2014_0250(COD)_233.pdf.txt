2014/0250(COD) - 01/09/2014 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 55/2008 with a view to further liberalising imports of certain products of the fruit and
vegetables sector from Moldova into the EU.

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 55/2008 established a specific scheme of autonomous trade preferences (ATPs) for Moldova.
That scheme gives all products originating in the Republic of Moldova free access to the Union market, except for certain agricultural products
listed in Annex I to that Regulation for which limited concessions have been granted either in the form of exemption from customs duties within
the limit of tariff quotas or of reduction of customs duties.
In the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), the EU-Moldova ENP Action Plan, and the Eastern Partnership, Moldova has
adopted an ambitious agenda for political association and further economic integration with the Union.
The Association Agreement, including the establishment of a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) between the Union and
Moldova was signed on 27 June 2014 and will apply provisionally from 1 September 2014. The specific scheme of autonomous trade
preferences will continue to apply until 31 December 2015.
Recently Moldova has experienced and continues to experience difficulties with its fruit and vegetables exports to some of its traditional
markets, which threaten its economic recovery and the reform process that is vigorously pursued by the government of Moldova. The
agricultural sector represents around 40 per cent of Moldova's economy and the horticultural sector is an important part of it, providing
employment to some 250 000 people (i.e. around 10% of the active population). Moreover, horticultural export levels have fallen in recent
years.
Taking into consideration the current temporary severe difficulties in accessing Moldova's traditional export markets for a number of products,
the European Commission proposes to increase temporarily its fully liberalised market access for imports of these products from Moldova,
allowing their commercialisation in the Union.
CONTENT: in order to support the efforts of Moldova in accordance with the objectives set out in the ENP, the Eastern Partnership and the
Association Agreement, the proposed amendment to Council Regulation (EC) No 55/2008 introduces three new duty free tariff quotas for fresh
apples, fresh table grapes and fresh plums.
As the Autonomous Trade Preference scheme expires at the end of 2015, this amendment provides for a time-limited response to the
immediate needs for the key export products adversely affected (i.e. apples, plums and table grapes).
BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposed amendment to the Regulation incurs negligible implications for the EU budget. The total imports
from Moldova to the EU in 2013 constituted 0.1% of the total imports to the EU. Whereas about 90% of all imports from Moldova enter the EU
duty-free, imports of fresh apples, fresh plums and fresh table grapes under entry price from the Republic of Moldova represented less than
0.01% of the total EU imports from the world of these products.
The corresponding loss of tariff revenue should therefore have a limited impact on the EUs own resources.

2014/0250(COD) - 05/12/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on International Trade adopted the report by Sorin MOIS? (S&D, RO) on the proposal for a regulation of the European
Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 55/2008 introducing autonomous trade preferences for the Republic of
Moldova.
It recommended the European Parliament to adopt its position at first reading, taking over the Commission proposal.
In recent years, the EU and Moldova intensified their political and economic relations notably through the conclusion of an Association
Agreement. The Agreement, signed on 27 June 2014, includes a trade pillar, which will lead to the creation of a "Deep and Comprehensive
Free Trade Area" (DCFTA) between the Parties. The DCFTA has been provisionally applied since 1 September 2014.
Due to the intensification of economic and political relations between the EU and Moldova, a politically motivated import ban was imposed as
of 21 July 2014 by Russia on agricultural products from Moldova . The ban is hurting Moldova's economy in a significant way - agriculture
represents around 40% of Moldova's economy.
Seeking some relief and support at this critical juncture, the Moldovan authorities have turned to the EU, requesting urgent support to reduce
the economic impact of the Russian ban, in particular for the most important products for Moldovan fruit growers: apples, plums and table
grapes.
Consequently, as an act of solidarity, the Commission proposed to amend the Autonomous trade preferences Regulation (ATP Regulation) by
introducing three new duty-free tariff rate quotas (TRQs) in addition to the TRQs proposed under the DCFTA.
The total imports from Moldova of these products will have a negligible impact on the EU budget. In light of this, Members called on the
European Parliament to approve the Commission proposal without amendments.

2014/0250(COD) - 17/12/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 551 votes to 67, with 23 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 55/2008 introducing autonomous trade preferences for the
Republic of Moldova.
Parliament adopted its position at first reading without making amendments to the Commission proposal.
The proposal seeks to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 55/2008 with a view to further liberalising imports of certain products of the fruit and
vegetables sector from Moldova into the EU.
In order to support the efforts of Moldova in accordance with the objectives set out in the European Neighbourhood Policy, the Eastern
Partnership and the Association Agreement signed between Moldova and the EU on 27 June 2014, the amended proposal introduces three

new duty free tariff quotas for fresh apples, fresh table grapes and fresh plums.

2014/0250(COD) - 18/12/2014 Final act
PURPOSE: to further liberalising imports of certain products of the fruit and vegetables sector from Moldova into the EU.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Regulation (EU) No 1383/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No
55/2008 introducing autonomous trade preferences for the Republic of Moldova.
CONTENT: the Regulation amends Council Regulation (EC) No 55/2008 with a view to further liberalising imports of certain products of the
fruit and vegetables sector from Moldova into the EU.
In order to support Moldovas efforts in accordance with the objectives set out in the ENP, the Eastern Partnership and the Association
Agreement between Moldova and the EU on 27 June 2014, the amendment introduced three new duty free tariff quotas for its exports of fresh
apples (40 000 tonnes), fresh plums and fresh table grapes (10 000 for each product).
In view of the seasonal production peak of those products, it is appropriate to apply the further concessions from 1 August 2014. The specific
scheme of autonomous trade preferences will continue to apply until 31 December 2015.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 30.12.2014.
APPLICATION: as from 01.08.2014.
