Summary

2014/2921(RSP) - 13/11/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a resolution on Turkish actions creating tensions in the exclusive economic zone of Cyprus.
The text adopted in plenary was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ECR, ALDE, GUE/NGL and the EFDD groups.
On 3 October 2014, Turkey issued a NAVTEX (Navigational Telex) directive, by which it designated a large area within the southern part of the
exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the Republic of Cyprus as being reserved for seismic surveys to be conducted by the Turkish vessel
Barbaros from 20 October to 30 December 2014.
Despite repeated calls by the EU, Turkey continues to contest the existence of the Republic of Cyprus and the legitimacy of exploration and
exploitation by Cyprus of natural resources within its EEZ. Members considered that Turkeys claims and actions have no legal foundation and
are in direct conflict with international law, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).
Deploring the escalation of threats and unilateral action by Turkey against Cyprus in relation to the EEZ and calling the legality of the EEZ of
Cyprus, Parliament called on Turkey to:
show restraint and respect the sovereignty of EU Member States over their territorial waters and act in accordance with international
law by signing and ratifying the UNCLOS, which is part of the acquis communautaire;
revoke its NAVTEX immediately, and to refrain from any violations of the sovereign rights of Cyprus;
immediately withdraw Turkish vessels operating in waters in and around the EEZ of Cyprus;
stop provocative actions within the EEZ of Cyprus and of refraining from making threats against Cyprus.
Parliament reiterated the importance it attaches to the normalisation of relations between Turkey and all EU Member States, and is of the view
that the continuation and/or repetition of these actions could have a negative impact on Turkeys relations with the EU, including its accession
process. It expressed its continued commitment to, and support for, the reunification talks under UN auspices for a comprehensive settlement
of the Cyprus problem.
Lastly, it requested that the European External Action Service and the Commission closely follow Turkeys activities within the EEZ of the
Republic of Cyprus and report back to Parliament.
