2014/2089(DEC) - 30/07/2014 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: presentation by the Commission of the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2013, as part of
the 2013 discharge procedure.
Analysis of the accounts of the European Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA).
CONTENT: this Commission document sets out the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2013 as
prepared on the basis of the information presented by the institutions, organisations and bodies of the EU, in accordance with Article 129 (2) of
the Financial Regulation applicable to the EU's General Budget, including the European Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA).
The document contains the figures on which the discharge procedure is based.
Discharge procedure of the EU agencies: the EU Budget finances a wide range of policies and programmes throughout the EU. In accordance
with the priorities set by the European Parliament and the Council in the multi-annual financial framework (MFF), the European Commission
carries out specific programmes, activities and projects in the field with the technical support of some specialised agencies.
The consolidated annual accounts of the EU provide information on the activities of the institutions, agencies and other bodies of the EU from
a budgetary and accrual accounting perspective.
The consolidated reports on the implementation of the general budget of the EU include the budget implementation of all Institutions. Agencies
do not have a separate budget inside the EU budget; and they are partially financed by a Commission budget subsidy.
Each agency is subject to its own discharge procedure.
FRA: in 2013, the tasks and budget of this agency were as follows:
description of FRA's tasks: the Agency, which is located in Vienna, was established by Council Regulation (EC) No 168/2007. Its main
objective is to provide the relevant authorities of the Union and its Member States with assistance and expertise when implementing
Union law relating to fundamental rights. The Agencys task is to collect information as well as providing expert advice to the
institutions on a range of issues.

FRA's budget for the 2013 financial year: the Agencys budget for 2013, as presented in the Commission document on the
consolidated annual accounts of the European Union, gives the following figures:
§

Commitment appropriations :
- committed : EUR 22 million;
- paid : EUR 22 million;
- carried-over : 0.

§

Payment appropriations :
- committed : EUR 26 million;
- paid : EUR 20 million;
- carried-over : EUR 7 million.

Please refer also to the final accounts of the FRA.

2014/2089(DEC) - 16/09/2014 Court of Auditors: opinion, report
PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the European Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) for the
financial year 2013, together with the Agencys reply.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit concerned, amongst others, the annual accounts of the European Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA).
Statement of assurance: pursuant to the provisions of Article 287 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the Court
has audited:
the annual accounts of the Centre, which comprise the financial statements and the reports on the implementation of the budget for
the financial year ended 31 December 2013;
the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying those accounts.
Opinion on the reliability of the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the Agencys annual accounts present fairly, in all material respects, its
financial position as at 31 December 2013 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the
provisions of its Financial Regulation and the accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
Opinion on the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the transactions underlying the annual
accounts for the year ended 31 December 2013 are legal and regular in all material respects.
The report also makes a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of the Agency, accompanied by the latters
response. The main observations may be summarised as follows:
The Courts observations:
budgetary management: the level of committed appropriations carried over to 2014 was high (27%) for administrative expenditure and
69% for operating expenditure. The carryovers mainly reflect the multi-annual nature of the Agencys operational projects.
The Centres replies:
budgetary management: the Agency replied that the Agency plans the carry overs for the following year and closely monitors their
evolution. The level of cancellations (less than 2 %) is an indicator of the precise planning and management of the carry overs. The
Agencys consumption of its EU subsidy over the past two budget years has been in excess of 99% demonstrating an excellent
budgetary management.
Lastly, the Court of Auditors report contains a summary of the Agencys activities in 2013. This is focused on the following:
Budget: EUR 21.62 million of which the Union subsidy is 99%.
Activities:
various contributions to the FRANET network (comparative analysis);
publication of research and annual reports;
conferences and events;
cooperation with Member States and European and international institutions.

2014/2089(DEC) - 30/03/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Ryszard CZARNECKI (ECR, PL) on discharge in respect of the implementation of
the budget of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) for the financial year 2013.
It called on the European Parliament to grant the Director of the Agency discharge in respect of the implementation of the Agencys budget for

the financial year 2013.
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the Agency for the financial
year 2013 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Members called on the Parliament to approve the closure of
the Agencys accounts. They made, however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is
granted, in addition to the general recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of
EU agencies.
Agencys financial statements: Members noted that the final budget of the Centre for the financial year 2013 was EUR 21 348 510,
representing an increase of 4.77% compared to 2012.
Carry-overs: Members noted that budget monitoring efforts during the financial year 2013 resulted in a budget implementation rate of
100%, and that the payment appropriations execution rate was 70.27%. They noted that the high overall level of committed
appropriations indicated that commitments were made in a timely manner. Members were concerned, however, that that the level of
committed appropriations carried over to 2014 was high at 27 % for administrative expenditure and at 69 % for operating expenditure,
due to the purchase of IT goods and services.
Members also made a series of observations on procurement and recruitment procedures, prevention and conflicts of interest and internal
audits. Lastly, the committee urged the Agency to harmonise the presentation of its annual accounts with those of other Union Agencies.

2014/2089(DEC) - 29/04/2015 Final act
PURPOSE: to grant discharge to the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) for the financial year 2013.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision (EU) 2015/1689 of the European Parliament on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of
the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights for the financial year 2013.
CONTENT: with the present decision, the European Parliament grants discharge to the Director of the European Union Agency for
Fundamental Rights for the implementation of its budget for the financial year 2013.
This decision is in line with the European Parliament's resolution adopted on 29 April 2015 and comprises a series of observations that form
an integral part of the discharge decision (please refer to the summary of the opinion of 29 April 2015).
Amongst the main observations made, Parliament reiterated the request to all agencies and joint undertakings to systematically annex a
standardised template regarding the publication of their final annual accounts which shall include the data presented in their reports on the
implementation of the budget and in their reports on the budgetary and financial management.

2014/2089(DEC) - 29/04/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 563 votes to 111, 17 abstentions, a decision to grant discharge to the Director of the European Union
Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) for the financial year 2013. The vote on the discharge decision approved the closure of the accounts (in
accordance with Annex VI, Article 5(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament).
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the Agency for the financial
year 2013 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Parliament adopted by 578 votes to 102, with 6 abstentions,
a resolution containing a number of recommendations that form an integral part of the discharge decision and as well as the general
recommendations that appear in the resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies:
Agencys financial statements: Parliament noted that the final budget of the Centre for the financial year 2013 was EUR 21 348 510,
representing an increase of 4.77% compared to 2012.
Carry-overs: Parliament noted that budget monitoring efforts during the financial year 2013 resulted in a budget implementation rate of
100%, and that the payment appropriations execution rate was 70.27%. It noted that the high overall level of committed appropriations
indicated that commitments were made in a timely manner. Members were concerned, however, that that the level of committed
appropriations carried over to 2014 was high at 27 % for administrative expenditure and at 69 % for operating expenditure, due to the
purchase of IT goods and services.
Parliament also made a series of observations on procurement and recruitment procedures, prevention and conflicts of interest and internal
audits.
As regards transparency, Parliament reiterated the request to all agencies and joint undertakings to systematically annex a standardised
template regarding the publication of their final annual accounts which shall include the data presented in their reports on the implementation
of the budget and in their reports on the budgetary and financial management. Lastly, Parliament urged the Agency to harmonise the
presentation of its annual accounts with those of other Union Agencies.
