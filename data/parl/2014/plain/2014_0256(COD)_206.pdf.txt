2014/0256(COD) - 10/09/2014 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to amend Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 laying down Community procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal
products for human and veterinary use and establishing a European Medicines Agency.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the Council and the European Parliament.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EC) 726/2004 of the European
Parliament and of the Council constituted the Union regulatory framework for the manufacture, authorisation and distribution of veterinary
medicinal products.
In the light of the experience acquired and following the assessment by the Commission of the functioning of the internal market for veterinary
medicinal products, the Commission has presented a proposal that will repeal and replace Directive 2001/82/EC on veterinary medicinal
products. This proposal lays down procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use. It is
therefore necessary to amend Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 to take account of the fact that centralised marketing authorisation for veterinary
products is being decoupled from that for medicines for humans.
IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the consultation and a study, An assessment of the impact of the revision of veterinary pharmaceutical legislation,
formed the basis of an impact assessment carried out for the Commission between November 2009 and June 2011. The Commissions Impact
Assessment Board (IAB) released its final opinion in September 2013.
CONTENT: the proposal seeks to amend Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 so as to:
delete from Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 the provisions regarding granting and maintaining marketing authorisations for veterinary
medicinal products. The rules on marketing authorisations valid in all EU Member States are part of the proposal for a Regulation on
veterinary medicinal products. The new Regulation on veterinary medicinal products will cover all routes granting marketing
authorisations for veterinary medicinal products in the Union both at centralised and national level;
establish certain principles applicable to fees payable to the Agency, including the need to take into account, as appropriate, the
specific needs for SMEs. The provisions regulating fees should be brought into line with the Treaty of Lisbon;
align the powers conferred on the Commission under Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 to Articles 290 and 291 (delegated and
implementing acts) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the costs for the EMA for implementing and applying the new rules are entirely covered by fees charged to
industry. Therefore, the proposal is not expected to have any financial impact on the budget of the EU.
As set out in the legislative financial statement the additional resource needs for EMA are approximately 8 staff plus expenditure for meetings,
translation, IT, etc. The level of fees, their structure and modalities and exceptions will be set at a later stage by the Commission by way of
implementing acts.
DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of
the treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

2014/0256(COD) - 23/02/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety adopted the report by Claudiu Ciprian T?N?SESCU (S&D, RO) on the
proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 laying down Community
procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing a European Medicines
Agency.
The committee recommended that Parliament make the following amendments to the Commission proposal:
Fees: Members clarified and separated the Agencys sources of revenue, stating that revenue will consist of:
a contribution from the Union;
a contribution from any European third country with which the Union has concluded agreements;
the fees paid by undertakings for obtaining and maintaining Union marketing authorisations for human and veterinary medicinal
products and for other services provided by the Agency;
charges for any other services provided by the Agency; and
other sources of income, including any ad-hoc grants within the scope of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 on the general
budget of the Union.
The European Parliament and the Council will re-examine, when necessary, the level of the Union contribution on the basis of an evaluation of
needs and by taking account of the level of fees.
Reserve fund: in order to safeguard fluctuations in fee revenue, any positive budget outturn of a financial year will be set aside as assigned
revenue and serve as a reserve in the event that actual fee revenue be below budgeted appropriations.
Co-decision rather than an implementing act: Members felt that matters relating to the structure and level of fees should be decided through
the co-decision procedure rather than through implementing acts. Accordingly, they deleted the relevant parts of the text that empowered the
Commission to adopt implementing acts relating to fees.
Centralised procedure: the committee referred to the new Veterinary Medicines Regulation, and stressed the role of the EMA in the
authorisation and supervision of veterinary products through the centralised procedure.
Alternative models: the Agency shall develop a framework for the regulatory acceptance of alternative models and take into consideration the

opportunities presented by new concepts which aim at providing for more predictive medicines.
Transitional arrangements: with regard to the level and the structure of the fees, Regulation (EC) No 297/95 and Regulation (EU) No 658/2014
will be applicable until an amendment of Regulation (EC) No 297/95 or any other relevant provisions on fees are adopted and become
applicable.
Report: a report on the experience acquired through the Regulation will be published every five years (rather than every ten years).

2014/0256(COD) - 10/03/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, partial vote at 1st reading/single
reading
The European Parliament adopted amendments to the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 laying down Community procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and
veterinary use and establishing a European Medicines Agency.
The matter has been referred back to the committee. The vote on the legislative resolution has been postponed to a subsequent sitting .
The main elements adopted in plenary are as follows:
Fees: Members clarified and separated the Agencys sources of revenue, stating that revenue will consist of:
a contribution from the Union;
a contribution from any European third country with which the Union has concluded agreements;
the fees paid by undertakings for obtaining and maintaining Union marketing authorisations for human and veterinary medicinal
products and for other services provided by the Agency;
charges for any other services provided by the Agency; and
other sources of income, including any ad-hoc grants within the scope of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 on the general
budget of the Union (Financial Regulation).
The European Parliament and the Council will re-examine, when necessary, the level of the Union contribution on the basis of an evaluation of
needs and by taking account of the level of fees.
Reserve fund: in order to safeguard fluctuations in fee revenue, any positive budget outturn of a financial year will be set aside as assigned
revenue and serve as a reserve in the event that actual fee revenue be below budgeted appropriations. The total amount of such a safeguard
fund shall not exceed the Agency's appropriations for the fee revenue of the past year.
Financial provisions: the Executive Director shall implement the budget of the Agency. By 1 March of the following financial year, the Agency's
accounting officer shall send the provisional accounts to the Commission's Accounting Officer and to the Court of Auditors.
By 31 March of the following financial year, the Executive Director shall send the report on the budgetary and financial management to the
European Parliament, the Commission, the Council and the Court of Auditors.
Structure and level of fees: Members felt that matters relating to the structure and level of fees should be decided through the co-decision
procedure rather than through implementing acts. Accordingly, they deleted the relevant parts of the text that empowered the Commission to
adopt implementing acts relating to fees.
Centralised procedure: in the interest of public health, authorisation decisions adopted under the centralised procedure should be taken on the
basis of the objective scientific criteria of quality, safety and efficacy. It is proposed for reference to be made to the new Veterinary Medicines
Regulation, and that the role of the EMA in the authorisation and supervision of veterinary products through the centralised procedure should
be stressed.
Alternative models: the Agency shall develop a framework for the regulatory acceptance of alternative models and take into consideration the
opportunities presented by new concepts which aim at providing for more predictive medicines. These concepts may be based on
human-relevant computer or cellular models, pathways of toxicity, or adverse outcome pathways.
Transitional arrangements: with regard to the level and the structure of the fees, Regulation (EC) No 297/95 and Regulation (EU) No 658/2014
will be applicable until an amendment of Regulation (EC) No 297/95 or any other relevant provisions on fees are adopted and become
applicable.
Report: a report on the experience acquired through the Regulation will be published every five years (rather than every ten years).
