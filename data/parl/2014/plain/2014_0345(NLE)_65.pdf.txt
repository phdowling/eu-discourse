2014/0345(NLE) - 08/12/2014 Initial legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to authorise Austria, Belgium and Poland to ratify or to accede to, the Budapest Convention on the Contract for the Carriage of
Goods by Inland Waterways ( CMNI).
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: The Union is working towards the establishment of a common judicial area based on the principle of mutual recognition of
judicial decisions. The Budapest Convention on the contract for the carriage of goods by inland waterways (CMNI) is a valuable instrument for
promoting inland navigation across Europe.
The Convention has been adopted by the Diplomatic Conference organised jointly by the Central Commission for the Navigation of the Rhine
and the Danube Commission in collaboration with the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.
The Budapest Convention is not open to participation by regional economic integration organisations. As a result, the Union is not in a position
to become a Contracting Party to the Budapest Convention. Eleven of the Member States of the Union, namely Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia,
Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Romania, Slovakia are Contracting Parties to the Budapest
Convention. Belgium ratified the Convention on 5 August 2008.
Austria and Poland, which have navigable inland waterways coming within the scope of the Convention, expressed their interest in becoming
Contracting Parties. The remaining Member States of the Union indicated that they do not have inland waterways covered by the Budapest
Convention and thus they do not have an interest in ratifying or acceding to the Convention.
CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council authorise Austria and Poland to ratify or to accede to, the Budapest Convention on the
Contract for the Carriage of Goods by Inland Waterways (CMNI). The Convention, which entered into force on 1 April 2005, has proven to be a
great success and contributes to the internal market in the field of transport. It aims to harmonise contractual and inland navigational standards
among European countries.

2014/0345(NLE) - 01/06/2015 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to authorise Belgium, respectively, to ratify, and Austria to accede to the Budapest Convention on the Contract for the Carriage of
Goods by Inland Waterways (CMNI).
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
CONTENT: under the proposed Decision, the Council would authorise Belgium and Poland, respectively, to ratify, and Austria to accede to the
Budapest Convention on the Contract for the Carriage of Goods by Inland Waterways (CMNI).
The Budapest Convention on the Contract for the Carriage of Goods by Inland Waterways (CMNI) is a valuable instrument to promote inland
navigation across Europe. Given that the Union is not in a position to become a Contracting Party to the Convention, Member States which
have navigable inland waterways falling within the scope of the Budapest Convention should therefore be authorised to ratify or accede to the
Convention.
Eleven Member States: Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Germany, France, Croatia, Luxembourg, Hungary, the Netherlands, Romania
and the Slovak Republic are Contracting Parties to the Budapest Convention.
Austria and Poland, which have navigable inland waterways falling within the scope of the Budapest Convention, have expressed their interest
in becoming Contracting Parties to the Convention. Belgium ratified the Budapest Convention after the adoption of Regulation (EC) No
593/2008 by which the Union acquired exclusive external competence. The Council should therefore ex post authorise Belgium to ratify the
Convention.
This Convention is applicable to any contract of carriage according to which the port of loading or the place of taking over of the goods and the
port of discharge or the place of delivery of the goods are located in two different States of which at least one is a State Party to this
Convention.
This Convention is applicable regardless of the nationality, place of registration or home port of the vessel or whether the vessel is a maritime
or inland navigation vessel and regardless of the nationality, domicile, registered office or place of residence of the carrier, the shipper or the
consignee.
For further details, please refer to the summary of the Commissions initial legislative procedure dated 8.12.2014.

Austria and Poland have expressed an interest in becoming parties to the convention. Members considered that their participation will foster
