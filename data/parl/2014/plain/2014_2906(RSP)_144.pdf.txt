Summary

2014/2906(RSP) - 13/11/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a resolution tabled by the EPP, S&D, ECR, ALDE, GUE/NGL and Greens/EFA groups on the Northern
Ireland peace process.
Recalling that it is essential to end all violent conflict within the European Union, Parliament expressed its concern at the fact that the
implementation of the peace process has reached an impasse. It urged all parties to the process to work constructively towards a lasting
resolution of the conflict and the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent agreements for a long-lasting and
enduring peace.
It is recalled that the talks between the political parties and the UK and Irish Governments resulted in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement
(Belfast Agreement), which provided for the establishment of a devolved administration involving the establishment a power-sharing Assembly
and Executive, a North/South Ministerial Council, a North/South Inter-Parliamentary Association, a North/South Consultative Forum, a
British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, a British-Irish Council and an expanded British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body.

Parliament welcomed the initiative to convene all-party talks to overcome the current impasse, and underlined the necessity of agreement on
outstanding issues in order to underpin the functioning and stability of the democratic institutions of Northern Ireland. It stressed the need to
combat such criminal activity by tackling existing economic challenges such as unemployment and low incomes and living standards.
Highlighting support from the EUs European Regional Development Fund and, in particular, the EUR 150 million for the PEACE Programme,
Members stressed the urgent need to further encourage reconciliation and improve relationships between communities and also to boost
economic and social development in order to consolidate the peace process.
Parliament emphasised that it stands ready to offer any support that the parties concerned think would be of assistance to the peace process
and invited the First Minister and deputy First Minister to address Parliament upon the successful completion of the all-party talks.
