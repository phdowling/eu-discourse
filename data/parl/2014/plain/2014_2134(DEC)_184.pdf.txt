2014/2134(DEC) - 30/07/2014 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: presentation by the Commission of the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2013, as part of
the 2013 discharge procedure.
Analysis of the accounts of the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Fuel Cell Joint Undertaking (FCH JU).
CONTENT: this Commission document sets out the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2013 as
prepared on the basis of the information presented by the institutions, organisations and bodies of the EU, in accordance with Article 129 (2) of
the Financial Regulation applicable to the EU's General Budget, including the FCH Joint Undertaking.
The document contains the figures on which the discharge procedure is based.
Discharge procedure of the EU Joint Undertakings: the EU Budget finances a wide range of policies and programmes throughout the EU. In
accordance with the priorities set by the European Parliament and the Council in the multi-annual financial framework (MFF), the European
Commission carries out specific programmes, activities and projects in the field with the technical support of some specialised agencies.
The consolidated annual accounts of the EU provide information on the activities of the institutions, agencies and other bodies of the EU from
a budgetary and accrual accounting perspective.
The consolidated reports on the implementation of the general budget of the EU include the budget implementation of all Institutions. Agencies
and Joint Undertakings (JUs) do not have a separate budget inside the EU budget ; and they are partially financed by a Commission budget
subsidy.
Each JU is subject to its own discharge procedure.
FCH JU: in 2013, the tasks and budget of the Joint Undertaking were as follows:
description of the tasks of the Joint Undertaking: the FCH Joint Undertaking, located in Brussels, was set up in 2008 by Council
Regulation (EC) No 521/2008 for the period up to 31 December 2017. The objective of the FCH Joint Undertaking is to combine
resources from the public and private sectors to strengthen research activities with a view to increasing the overall efficiency of
European research efforts and accelerate the development and deployment of fuel cell and hydrogen technologies;
accounts of the JU: the maximum indicative contribution of the EU amounts to EUR 470 million up to 31 December 2017, At 31
December 2013, the Commission held 74.2% of the ownership participation in FCH. The cumulative unrecognised share of losses is
EUR 67 million.

Please also consult the final accounts of FCH Joint Undertaking.

2014/2134(DEC) - 21/10/2014 Court of Auditors: opinion, report
PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking for the
financial year 2013, together with the Joint Undertakings reply.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit concerned, amongst others, the annual accounts of the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen (FCH) Joint Undertaking.
Statement of assurance: pursuant to the provisions of Article 287 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the Court
has audited:
the annual accounts of the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking, which comprise the financial statements and the reports on the
implementation of the budget for the financial year ended 31 December 2013;
the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying those accounts.
Opinion on the reliability of the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the Joint Undertakings annual accounts present fairly, in all material respects,
its financial position as at 31 December 2013 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with
the provisions of its financial rules and the accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
Opinion on the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the transactions underlying the annual
accounts for the year ended 31 December 2013 are, in all material respects, legal and regular.
At the end of this audit, the Court concluded the following:
budgetary and financial management: the budgetary implementation rate of payment appropriations was very weak (57%) resulting
from the postponement of the funding of three projects;
internal audit functions: the FCH Joint Undertaking Internal Audit Capability (IAC) carried out one audit on Grant
Management-negotiation, contracting and prefinancing during 2013 and performed other assurance and consultancy services. The
Final Report on Grant Management noted the need to reduce the Time to Grant and Time to Close Negotiations and the need to
clarify some aspects of the Joint Undertakings procedure for Financial Viability Checks;
conflicts of interest: the FCH Joint Undertaking has put specific measures in place to prevent conflicts of interest in respect of its three
key stakeholders: Governing Board members, experts and employees.
Cross-cutting remarks for all the Joint undertakings: the prevention of conflicts of interest is addressed by most Joint Undertakings by the
adoption of specific rules and by the development of tools to document all related information. An Interim Evaluation was performed over 2013
assessing all Joint Undertakings in terms of relevance, efficiency, effectiveness and research quality. The reports, while positive, also
highlighted areas for further improvement. In general, all Joint Undertakings have produced reliable accounts but there is room for
improvement.
Joint Undertakings replies: the Joint Undertaking replied point by point to all of the technical elements highlighted by the Court of Auditors. It
has developed an action plan to address the recommendations of the IAC audit on Grant Management, negotiation, contracting and
prefinancing. Part of the actions are implemented and the others are under revision in the context of an update of the action plan to take into
account the impact of the new legal environment and in particular the new rules under Horizon 2020.
As regards the activities of the Joint Undertaking in 2013, the report refers to the Annual Activity Report 2013 which can be found at
http://www.fch-ju.eu/page/documents
It should be noted that the budget for the Joint Undertaking for 2013 amounted to EUR 82.5 million in commitment appropriations.

2014/2134(DEC) - 31/03/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Ryszard CZARNECKI (ECR, PL) on discharge in respect of the implementation of
the budget of the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking for the financial year 2013.
It called on the European Parliament to grant the Executive Director of the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen 2 (FCH 2) Joint Undertaking discharge in
respect of the implementation of the Joint Undertakings budget for the financial year 2013.
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of FCH 2 for the financial year
2013 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Members called on the Parliament to approve the closure of FCH
2s accounts. They made, however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is granted, in
addition to the general recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies
.
·

Budgetary and financial management: Members noted that the Joint Undertaking's final budget for the financial year 2013 included
commitment appropriations of EUR 74.5 million and payment appropriations of EUR 69.7 million. They observed moreover, that the
utilisation rates for commitment and payment appropriations were 98.9 % and 56.7 % respectively. the level of payment
appropriations is lower than the previous year was due to the postponement of funding of three projects.

·

Conflicts of interests: other than the weaknesses noted by the Court, Members remarked that FCH2 had put in place specific
measures in order to prevent conflicts of interest in respect of its three key stakeholders - Governing Board members, experts and

employees - such as a clear definition of conflict of interest with a database of all related information and process for managing
them. They noted that the written procedure regarding the specific measures was submitted to the Governing Board in November
2014.
Other observations: the committee also made a series of observations on the legal framework of the Joint Undertaking, and the current call for
proposals. It took note that the Joint Undertaking, along with ARTEMIS, Clean Sky, Eniac and IMI Joint Undertakings, was the subject of an IT
risk assessment of the common IT infrastructure performed by the Commissions Internal Audit Service.
Members observed that FCH 2 had introduced a new IT tool which helped with the analysis and synthesis of the results of finished projects
and reporting the first public foreground deliverables arising from complex projects. They called on the Joint Undertaking to submit a report to
the discharge authority on the social-economic benefits of the projects already completed.
They acknowledged the Joint Undertakings efforts to examine the possibility of using the Commissions IT system for monitoring purposes
related to the protection, dissemination and transfer of research results as well as to develop its reporting on results. Lastly, Members recalled
that the discharge authority had previously requested the Court to draw up a special report on the capacity of the joint undertakings, together
with their private partners, to ensure added value and efficient execution of Union research, technological development and demonstration
programmes.
