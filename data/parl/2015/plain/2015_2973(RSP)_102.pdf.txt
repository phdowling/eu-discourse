Summary

The European Parliament adopted a resolution on the situation in Burundi.
The text adopted in plenary was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ECR, ALDE, GUE/NGL, Greens/EFA and EFDD groups.
Members stated that the security situation in Burundi has seriously deteriorated with the death of at least 87 people on 11 and 12 December
2015. Many of these killings seem to have been random executions.
Given that both electoral processes were considered by the international community not to be transparent, inclusive, free and credible and that
President Nkurunzizas re-election has plunged the country into its deepest political crisis since the end of the civil war, Parliament called for an
immediate end to violence, human rights violations and political intimidation of opponents and for the immediate disarmament of all armed
groups allied to political parties, in strict accordance with international law and human rights.
Members recalled that more than 200 000 people have been internally displaced or have sought refuge in neighbouring countries as a result of
the worsening political situation in Burundi and is considered one of the least developed countries in the world ranking 180th in the UNDPs
Human Development Index.
Therefore, Parliament urged all parties to establish the necessary conditions for rebuilding trust and fostering national unity, and called for the
immediate resumption of an inclusive and transparent national dialogue, including the government, opposition parties and civil society
representatives.
It demanded that all sides in Burundi refrain from any action that would threaten peace and security in the country and strongly condemned all
public statements aimed at inciting violence or hatred.
Whilst strongly condemning President Nkurunzizas violation of the Arusha Agreement in being sworn in for a third presidential term, Members
urged the competent authorities to undertake a rigorous and prompt investigation into the circumstances and motives behind these crimes and
to ensure that those responsible are brought to justice. They reiterated that there can be no impunity for those responsible for violations or
serious abuses of human rights.
Members urged in particular:
the safe return of journalists and human rights defenders in exile;
for the repeal of articles of the penal code which discriminate against LGBTI people.
The Commission is called upon to remain engaged with international partners in order to secure the provision of health care services, including
essential drugs to victims. Members welcomed the targeted sanctions approved by the EU, consistent with the decision taken by the AU to
impose targeted sanctions, including a travel ban and asset freeze against Burundians whose actions and statements contribute to the
perpetuation of violence and obstruct efforts to achieve a political settlement of the crisis.
Parliament urged the EU and its Member States to:
consider freezing all non-humanitarian assistance to the Government of Burundi until such time as the excessive use of force and
human rights violations by government forces has stopped;
increase financial support and humanitarian aid to address the urgent needs of these populations.
