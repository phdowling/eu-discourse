2015/0010(APP) - 20/01/2015 Initial legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to amend Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 laying down the multiannual financial framework for the years 2014-2020.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation.

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
CONTENT: Article 19 of Council Regulation No 1311/2013 stipulates that in the event of the adoption after 1 January 2014 of new rules or
programmes under shared management for the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development,
the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, the Asylum and Migration Fund and the Internal Security Fund, the MFF shall be revised in order
to transfer to subsequent years, in excess of the corresponding expenditure ceilings, allocations not used in 2014.
The revision concerning the transfer of unused allocation for the year 2014 shall be adopted before 1 May 2015.
It thus applies to programmes adopted after 1 January 2014 even when the relevant legal act was adopted by that time. Moreover, ?rules?
covers not only the basic legislative acts laying down the provisions for implementing the funds concerned, but also implementing and
delegated acts, to the extent to which they are a prerequisite for preparing or finalising the programmes.
Consequently, this provision also applies to funds from the specific allocation for the Youth Employment Initiative as the legal basis is the
same as for programmes.
It also applies to the Fund for European Aid to the most Deprived (FEAD) as its commitments originate from the Structural Funds and are
implemented under shared management.
Article 19 also covers contributions from the ERDF to the cross-border and sea-basin programmes established under the European
Neighbourhood Instrument and the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance as those amounts are part of national allocations defined in
Article 91(2) of the ESI Funds? Common Provisions Regulation (CPR). It should be noted that Article 19 does not impose any constraints as to
the profile of the transfer of allocations to subsequent years.
Amounts concerned: as a result of such late adoption:
EUR 11 216 187 326 in current prices of the allocation provided for the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund,
EUR 9 446 050 652 in current prices of the allocation provided for the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the
European Maritime and Fisheries Fund,
EUR 442 319 096 of the allocation provided for the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund and the Internal Security Fund could not
be committed in 2014 nor carried over to 2015.
This proposal seeks to amend Annex to Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 by transferring the commitment appropriations not used in
2014 to subsequent years for sub-heading 1b, heading 2 and heading 3.
N.B. the Commission proposes to transfer the bulk of the allocations not used in 2014 to year 2015 in order to keep the pace of investments
for growth and jobs, minimise differences of treatment with programmes adopted in 2014 and ensure equal treatment with programmes whose
2014 commitment tranche is carried-over in accordance with Article 13 of the Financial Regulation.
An annex sets outs details of the amounts transferred by the Funds concerned and by year of transfer.
IMPLICATIONS ON PAYMENTS: concerning the implications on payments in 2015, they will be covered within the voted budget for 2015. The
first initial pre-financing that has not been paid in 2014 will have to be paid in 2015 together with the second pre-financing. However, the
corresponding unused appropriations in 2014 have been used by transfers to reduce the backlog of unpaid bills from the previous period
2007-2013 and the reverse operation could be done, if need be, in 2015 to cover the pre-financings.
The medium and longer term implications on interim payments of the transfer are more difficult to predict.
The legislative acts laying down the provisions for implementing the funds contain provisions for the automatic decommitment of
appropriations not used within a given deadline, which is of n+3 years for the ESI Funds and of n+2 years for the AMIF and the ISF. This could
in principle result in a shift of payments from one year to another without this lowering the overall needs over the 2014-2020 period.
On the other hand, the real pace of implementation will not be pre-determined by the transfer.
For these reasons, the Commission does not propose to revise the payment ceilings. It will review the situation regularly in the light of
implementation and make proposals if appropriate in accordance with the relevant provisions of the MFF Regulation.

PURPOSE: to amend Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 laying down the multiannual financial
framework for the years 2014-2020.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its
consent to the act.
CONTENT: Article 19 of Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 provides that in the event of
the adoption after 1 January 2014 of new rules or programmes under shared management for the Structural
Funds, the Cohesion Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, the European Maritime
and Fisheries Fund, the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund and the Internal Security Fund, the
multiannual financial framework is to be revised in order to transfer to subsequent years, in excess of the
corresponding expenditure ceilings, allocations not used in 2014.
The revision concerning the transfer of unused allocations for the year 2014 shall be adopted before 1 May
2015.
Amounts concerned: as a result of such late adoption:
EUR 11 216 187 326 in current prices of the allocation provided for the Structural Funds and the
Cohesion Fund,

EUR 9 446 050 652 in current prices of the allocation provided for the European Agricultural Fund

Internal Security Fund could not be committed in 2014 nor carried over to 2015.
This proposal seeks to revise the annex to Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 be revised by

2015/0010(APP) - 10/02/2015 Debate in Council
The Council discussed a revision of the EU's multiannual financial framework (MFF) for 2014-2020 and took note of the state of play.
To recall, the aim of the revision is to allow the EU to transfer EUR 21.1 billion of unused commitments for certain funds from 2014 to
subsequent years.
These commitments remained unused in 2014 because of the late adoption of EU programmes jointly managed by the Commission and the
member states. The programmes concerned are supported by the structural funds, the cohesion fund, the European agricultural fund for rural
development, the European maritime and fisheries fund, the asylum, migration and integration fund, and the internal security fund.
The MFF regulation adopted on 2 December 2013 obliges the EU to revise its multiannual financial framework in the case of late adoption of
programmes under shared management. The MFF regulation also sets a deadline of 1 May 2015 for adopting the revision.
The Council must unanimously adopt the revised MFF regulation after having obtained the consent of the European Parliament.
State of play: a vast majority of delegations indicated their readiness to support the Commission's proposal. However, a small number of
Member States were still hesitant and requested additional information and assurance from the Commission in order to better understand the
justification for its suggestion to transfer the unused appropriations mainly to the year 2015.
In reply to the concerns of these Member States, the Commission pointed out that transferring a major share of the allocations to later years
would not be in line with the principle of equal treatment between Member States and also not in line with the European Union's commitment
to enhancing growth and creating jobs. Moreover, any shift of the unallocated amounts to later years would further increase the pressure on
payments at the end of the MFF period and beyond.
The Presidency concluded that an agreement on the proposed Regulation could not be reached at this stage. It recalls, however, the urgency
of reaching an agreement as soon as possible, given the tight time schedule for obtaining the European Parliament's consent and adopting the
revision within the deadline foreseen in the MFF Regulation.
The Presidency therefore emphasizes the need for the Council to take a position on the draft Council Regulation at the earliest convenience.

2015/0010(APP) - 01/04/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Budgets adopted the report by Jan OLBRYCHT (PPE, PL) and Isabelle THOMAS (S&D, FR) on the draft Council regulation
amending Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 laying down the multiannual financial framework for the years 2014/2020.
The parliamentary committee recommended that Parliament approve the draft Council regulation amending Regulation (EU, Euratom) No
1311/2013 fixing the multiannual financial framework for the years 2014-2020.
Following the late adoption (after 1 January 2014) of the new rules or new programmes in shared management, the allocations provided for
the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund,
the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund and the Internal Security Fund could not be committed in 2014 nor carried over to 2015.
The proposal aims to revise the Annex to Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 by transferring to subsequent years the commitment
appropriations not used in 2014 for sub-heading 1b, heading 2 and heading 3. For that purpose, the figures in current prices should be
converted into 2011 prices.

2015/0010(APP) - 15/04/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 591 votes to 24, with 28 abstentions, a legislative resolution approving the draft Council regulation
aiming to revise Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 setting the multiannual financial framework for the years 2014-2020.
It is recalled that following the late adoption (after 1 January 2014) of the new rules or new programmes in shared management, the
allocations:
·

EUR 11 216 187 326 in current prices of the allocation provided for the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund,

·

EUR 9 446 050 652 in current prices of the allocation provided for the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the
European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, and

·

EUR 442 319 096 of the allocation provided for the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund and the Internal Security Fund,

could neither be committed in 2014 nor carried over to 2015.

The proposal aims to revise the Annex to Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 by transferring to subsequent years the commitment
appropriations not used in 2014 for sub-heading 1b, heading 2 and heading 3. For that purpose, the figures in current prices should be
converted into 2011 prices.

2015/0010(APP) - 21/04/2015 Final act
PURPOSE: to amend Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 laying down the multiannual financial framework for the years 2014-2020.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2015/623 amending Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 laying down the
multiannual financial framework for the years 2014-2020.
CONTENT: the Regulation amends Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 laying down the multiannual financial framework for the years
2014-2020.
As a result of the late adoption of the programmes under shared management for the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Fund, the European
Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund and the
Internal Security Fund, the amounts could not be committed in 2014 nor carried over to 2015 . The financial framework should therefore be
revised by transferring the commitment appropriations not used in 2014 to subsequent years.
Therefore, this Regulation revises the Annex to Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 by transferring the commitment appropriations not
used in 2014 to subsequent years for sub-heading 1b (economic, social and territorial cohesion), heading 2 (Sustainable Growth: Natural
Resources) and heading 3 (Security and citizenship). For that purpose, the figures in current prices should be converted into 2011 prices.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 25.4.2015.
