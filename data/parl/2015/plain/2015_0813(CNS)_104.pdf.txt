PURPOSE: launch of automated data exchange with regard to Vehicle Registration Data (VRD) in Latvia.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Implementing Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT : the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to
follow its opinion.
BACKGROUND: with regard to Council Decision 2008/615/JHA on the stepping up of cross-border cooperation, particularly in combating
terrorism and cross-border crime, the supply of personal data provided for under that Decision may not take place until the general provisions

supply.
Council Decision 2008/616/JHA provides that the verification that the condition has been met with respect to automated data exchange in
accordance with Decision 2008/615/JHA is to be done on the basis of an evaluation report based on a questionnaire, an evaluation visit and a
pilot run.
Latvia has completed the questionnaire on data protection and the questionnaire on Vehicle Registration Data (VRD) exchange. It carried out
a successful pilot run with the Netherlands. An evaluation visit has taken place in Latvia.
On the basis of an overall evaluation report, the Council concluded on 8 October 2015 that Latvia had fully implemented the general provisions
on data protection set out in Chapter 6 of Decision 2008/615/JHA.
CONTENT: the proposed Council Implementing Decision aims to authorise Latvia to receive and supply personal data pursuant to Decision
2008/615/JHA from the date of entry into force of the Decision with respect to automated data exchange regarding Vehicle Registration Data.

subject to its application.
