Summary

2015/2015(IMM) - 18/06/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Legal Affairs adopted the report by Laura FERRARA (EFDD, IT) in which it recommended the European Parliament to
waive the immunity of Sotirios ZARIANOPOULOS (NI, EL).
Members recalled that the deputy public prosecutor of the Supreme Court of Greece requested the waiver of the immunity of Sotirios

Zarianopoulos, Member of the European Parliament, as part of an investigation concerning an alleged crime.
Sotirios Zarianopoulos is accused of having threatened physical violence and illegally entered the premises of Greek public television channel
ERT-3 on 4 March 2010 to interrupt the midday news bulletin and read out a statement.
The alleged crime clearly has no connection with the position of Sotirios Zarianopoulos as a Member of the European Parliament, given that it
relates to action carried out by the Greek trade union PAME and that Sotirios Zarianopoulos was not a Member of the European Parliament at
the time the offence was committed. The criminal proceedings do not concern any opinion expressed or vote cast in the performance of the
duties of a Member of the European Parliament for the purposes of Article 8 of Protocol No 7 on the Privileges and Immunities of the European
Union.
In accordance with the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, an opinion expressed by a Member of the European
Parliament in the performance of his or her duties is defined as being a subjective appraisal having a direct, obvious connection with the
performance of those parliamentary duties, but the alleged actions of Sotirios Zarianopoulos cannot be included in that definition.
There is no reason to assume that the intention underlying the criminal proceedings is to damage a Members political activity (fumus
persecutionis), given that the prosecution was initiated a number of years before the Member took up his post.
Therefore, the committee recommended the European Parliament to waive the parliamentary immunity of Sotirios Zarianopoulos.
