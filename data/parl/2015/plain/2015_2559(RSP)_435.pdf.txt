Summary

2015/2559(RSP) - 12/02/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a resolution on the humanitarian crisis in Iraq and Syria, in particular in the IS context.
The text adopted in plenary was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ECR, ALDE, Greens/EFA and EFDD groups.
Parliament strongly condemned the gruesome, systematic and widespread human rights abuses and violations committed by the Assad
regime, the terrorists of ISIL/Daesh and other jihadi groups in Iraq and Syria, including the killing of hostages, all forms of violence against
people on the basis of their religious or ethnic affiliation, and violence against women and LGBTI people. It also strongly condemned
ISIL/Daesh abuses against children and called for the immediate release of all hostages.
Global campaign for the region: Parliament supported the global campaign against ISIL/Daesh, and welcomed the commitment of the coalition
partners to working together under a common, multifaceted and long-term strategy to defeat ISIL/Daesh.
The European Union is called upon to adopt and implement a comprehensive regional strategy for defeating ISIL/Daesh and to contribute to
joint efforts to mitigate the humanitarian crisis and end the conflict in Syria and Iraq. This strategy should complement United Nations and
counter-ISIL/Daesh coalition activities and should engage with regional partners in order to address terrorism financing, the supply of weapons
and the flow of transnational foreign fighters.
More humanitarian aid: the ongoing violent crisis in Syria as a result of the Assad regime and terrorist violence has resulted in a humanitarian
catastrophe of an unprecedented scale in history, with more than 200 000 people killed, most of them civilians, more than 7.6 million people
internally displaced, and more than 12.2 million Syrians in desperate need of assistance inside Syria. The humanitarian situation in Iraq
continues to deteriorate with more than 5.2 million people in need of urgent humanitarian assistance. Iraq is also hosting more than 233 000
Syrian refugees.
Against this background, Parliament called on the international community to provide more humanitarian aid and assistance to the people
affected by the crisis in Iraq and Syria. It called for the EU to consider initiating the convening of a donor conference and for pressure to be put
on all donors to fulfil their promises and to deliver on their pledges swiftly.
Refugees: according to the Commission, approximately 276 000 refugees have tried to enter the EU illegally. According to international
organisations, nearly 2% of the refugees drowned during the journey.
Therefore, Members called on all the Member States to expedite the processing of asylum applications from the increasing number of
refugees fleeing the conflict zones. The EU should address the issue of the often fatal journeys across the Mediterranean, to implement a
coordinated strategy aimed at saving lives, and to provide support to the Member States most affected by the mass arrival of irregular migrants
and asylum seekers on their shores.
Foreign fighters: concerned at the fact that thousands of transnational foreign fighters, including citizens of the Member States, have joined the
ISIL/Daesh insurgency, Members called on the Member States to take appropriate measures to prevent fighters from travelling from their soil
and to develop a common strategy for security services and EU agencies with regard to monitoring and controlling jihadists.
Members called for cooperation in the EU and at international level with a view to appropriate legal action against any individual suspected of
being involved in acts of terrorism. Member States are invited to intensify cooperation and the exchange of information among themselves and
with EU bodies.
Expressing their concern at the increasing involvement of extremist Islamist groups and transnational foreign fighters in the conflict in Syria,
Parliament stressed that a lasting solution requires a political transition through a Syrian-led, inclusive political process with the support of the
international community. It also called on the new Iraqi leadership to act on its commitment to an inclusive government one that represents the
legitimate interests and addresses the dire humanitarian needs of all Iraqis.
Lastly, Members stressed that there can be no sustainable peace in Syria and Iraq without accountability for the crimes committed by all sides
during the conflict, in particular those based on religious or ethnic grounds.
