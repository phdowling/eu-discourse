Summary

2015/2665(RSP) - 30/04/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a resolution on the imprisonment of workers and human rights activists in Algeria.
The text adopted in plenary had been jointly tabled by the S&D, ALDE, GUE/NGL, Greens/EFA and EFDD groups.
Parliament expressed its concern at the arrest and detention of worker activists, as they are being detained in spite of the fact that their
activities are fully permissible under Algerian law and in line with the international human rights instruments which Algeria has ratified.
Recalling that Algeria has an obligation to respect universal human rights , including freedom of assembly and association, Members
considered that harassment and intimidation of labour rights activists and human rights defenders, including at judicial level, is not a practice in
accordance with the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders.
On the other hand, the right to a fair trial and ensuring a minimum guarantee for the rights of the defence for all detainees, including human
rights defenders and labour rights activists, is in compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), ratified by
Algeria.
Parliament called on the Algerian authorities to:
guarantee the right to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly, and to take appropriate steps to ensure the safety
and security of civil society activists and human rights defenders and their freedom to pursue their legitimate and peaceful activities;
repeal Law 12-06 on associations and to engage in a genuine dialogue with civil society organisations in order to frame a new law that
is in conformity with international human rights standards and the Algerian Constitution;
allow new trade unions to register legally and to comply with the conventions implemented by the ILO that have been ratified by
Algeria;
actively cooperate with the African Union human rights mechanisms, notably the Special Rapporteur on Human Rights Defenders.
The Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (VP/HR) and the EU Member
States are called upon to ensure that there is a clear and principled EU policy vis-Ã -vis Algeria that includes a human rights dialogue.
Parliament also urged for a stronger chapter on human rights in the future EU-Algeria Action Plan.
