Commission response to text adopted in

2015/2052(INI) - 30/07/2014 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: to provide guidelines on the application of the measures linking effectiveness of the European Structural and Investment Funds to
sound economic governance.
BACKGROUND: in the period 2014-2020, support from the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESI funds) is closely linked to the
respect of EU economic governance.
Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, the Common Provisions Regulation (CPR) on the five ESI funds, lays down the provisions linking the
effectiveness of the funds to sound economic governance. This conditionality applies through two distinct mechanisms:
a first strand, whereby the Commission may request a Member State to reprogramme part of its funding when this is justified by the
economic and employment challenges identified under various economic governance procedures; and
a second strand, whereby the Commission is obliged to propose a suspension of ESI funding when certain stages in the various
economic governance procedures are reached.
In 2014, Member States are negotiating their Partnership Agreements and programmes with the Commission. These will determine the
multiannual strategy for implementing the Member States allocation from the five ESI Funds over the seven years of the programming period
(2014-20). The Commission expects to approve Partnership Agreements and most programmes in the course of 2014.

Reprogramming under the Common Provisions Regulation is only possible as of 2015 and until 2019. This should only be used in cases
where it could have a higher impact than the existing allocation of the funds in the implementation of the relevant CSRs, relevant Council
recommendations or in the economic adjustment programmes.
CONTENT: this Communication follows up on the commitment given by the Commission to issue, not later than 6 months from the entry into
force of the Common Provisions Regulation, guidelines in the form of a Communication of the Commission explaining how it envisages that
the provisions on measures linking effectiveness of ESI Funds to sound economic governance will be applied.
These guidelines may be summarised as follows:
Review and types of amendments to Partnership Agreements and programmes:
in cases where a reprogramming request is triggered in the context of the European Semester, it will be as soon as possible after the
adoption of the relevant CSRs by the Council and, in any case, no later than four months after the Councils adoption. This will be
compatible with the indicated reprogramming deadlines and avoid interference with the subsequent round of CSRs. In case of
reprogramming requests to address Council recommendations in the context of excessive macroeconomic imbalances, the
Commission will consider similar deadlines;
the Commission will duly justify any reprogramming request and provide sufficient details regarding the programmes and priorities to
be reinforced or downsized according to the specific case, including an indication of the expected financial implications;
in any reprogramming request, the Commission will ask a Member State to review its Partnership Agreement and programmes. This
will serve to respond adequately to the economic and employment challenges identified in the relevant CSR, relevant Council
recommendation, or memorandum of understanding (in the case of Member States under financial assistance);
the first, clear-cut case of failing to take effective action is when a Member State simply fails to submit within the deadlines provided
for by the Regulation either a preliminary response or a proposal for amendment of its Partnership Agreement and the programmes
concerned;
the action undertaken by the Member State will be assessed on the basis of objective criteria. In case of failure to take effective action,
the Commission will explain in detail why amendments proposed by the Member State are considered to be insufficient.
Suspension of payments: if the Member State fails to take effective action within the deadlines set by the Common Provisions Regulation
(CPR), the Commission can make a proposal to the Council to suspend part or all of the payments for the programmes or priorities concerned.
The Commission may propose to the Council a suspension:
the Commission would consider proposing suspension in the case of no action, i.e. if the Member State fails to provide any preliminary
response to the Commission request or any proposal to amend its Partnership Agreement and programmes within the deadlines
provided for by the Regulation;
the suspension will be set at the amount necessary to provide the right incentives to the Member State to comply with the Commission
request;
any suspension will take account of mitigating factors: (i) the size of the suspension as a share of national GDP to ensure equality of
treatment across Member States; (ii) the economic and social circumstances of Member States, taking into consideration exceptional
circumstances;
the Commission will not propose any suspension of those programmes or priorities that are to be increased as a result of a
reprogramming or considered to be of critical importance.

2015/2052(INI) - 29/09/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Regional Development adopted an own-initiative report by José BLANCO LÓPEZ (S&D, ES) on the European Structural
and Investment Funds and sound economic governance: in response to the Commission communication on the guidelines on the application
of the measures linking effectiveness of the European Structural and Investment Funds to sound economic governance according to Article 23
of Regulation (EU) 1303/2013 on the common provisions (the CPR).
The Guidelines concern the first strand of measures linking the effectiveness of the ESI Funds to sound economic governance under Article 23
CPR. This relates to a reprogramming and a suspension of payments which are not compulsory, unlike the second strand of Article 23 CPR,
which requires the suspension of commitments or payments where Member States fail to take corrective action in the context of the economic
governance process.
Members believe that the achievement of the ESI Funds policy objectives and goals should not be hindered by the economic governance
mechanisms, while acknowledging their relevance in contributing to a stable macroeconomic environment and an efficient, effective and
result-oriented cohesion policy. They considered that Article 23 of the CPR must only be used as a last resort to contribute to an efficient
implementation of the ESI Funds.
Reprogramming under Article 23 CPR: Members made the following observations:
any decision regarding reprogramming or suspension under Article 23 CPR must only be used in exceptional situations, and must be
well-weighed, thoroughly justified and implemented in a cautious fashion, with indication of the programmes or priorities concerned in
order to ensure transparency and allow for verification and review;
frequent reprogramming would be counter-productive and should be avoided in order not to disrupt fund management or undermine
the stability and predictability of the multiannual investment strategy and to prevent any negative impacts.
The report welcomed the cautious approach of the Commission with regard to reprogramming and its intention to keep it to the minimum
necessary. It called for an early warning approach in order to inform Member States concerned of the launching of the reprogramming
procedure under Article 23 CPR, and emphasised that any reprogramming request should be preceded by consultation of the monitoring
committee.
The Commission is asked to:
carry out, in close cooperation with the Member State concerned, a comprehensive analysis of all available options other than the
application of Article 23 CPR to address issues that may trigger a reprogramming request;

evaluate the impact and cost-efficiency at regional and local levels of any measures adopted under Article 23 CPR;
read Article 23 CPR in line with the principle of proportionality, by taking into account the situation of those Member States and regions
which face socio-economic difficulties.
Members recalled that strong institutional coordination is essential for ensuring the right policy complementarities and synergies. They
considered it essential to ensure transparency and accountability by giving Parliament democratic oversight of the system of governance in the
context of Article 23 CPR.
Suspension of payments: the report emphasised the penalising nature of any suspension of payments, and asked the Commission to use its
discretionary power to propose the suspension of payments with utmost caution, after due consideration of all relevant information and
elements arising from and opinions expressed through the structured dialogue.
Role of the European Parliament: Members regretted that the Guidelines do not make any reference to the role of Parliament, despite the fact
that the CPR was adopted under the ordinary legislative procedure. They considered that the involvement of Parliament should be formalised
by way of a clear procedure allowing Parliament to be consulted at all stages as regards the adoption of reprogramming requests or of any
proposals and decisions on suspension of commitments or payments.

2015/2052(INI) - 28/10/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 482 votes to 100 with 51 abstentions, a resolution on the European Structural and Investment Funds
and sound economic governance: in response to the Commission communication on the guidelines on the application of the measures linking
effectiveness of the European Structural and Investment Funds to sound economic governance according to Article 23 of Regulation (EU)
1303/2013 on the common provisions (the CPR).
A proposal for a replacement resolution, tabled by the GUE/NGL group, was rejected in plenary by 54 votes to 521 with 89 abstentions.
Linking effectiveness of the ESI Funds to sound economic governance: it was recalled that the Guidelines concern the first strand of measures
linking the effectiveness of the ESI Funds to sound economic governance under Article 23 CPR. This relates to a reprogramming and a
suspension of payments which are not compulsory, unlike the second strand of Article 23 CPR, which requires the suspension of commitments

mechanisms, while acknowledging their relevance in contributing to a stable macroeconomic environment and an efficient, effective and
result-oriented cohesion policy. It considered that Article 23 of the CPR must only be used as a last resort to contribute to an efficient
implementation of the ESI Funds.
The Commission was asked to:
submit a white paper taking account of the effects of public investment in the long term and establishing a typology of quality
investments, so that those which produce best effects in the long term can be clearly identified;
provide further analytical data on the impact and significance of the macroeconomic mechanisms for regional development, for the
effectiveness of cohesion policy and for the interaction between the European economic governance framework and cohesion policy.
Members States, for their part, were asked to make best use of the flexibility existing under the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact.
Reprogramming under Article 23 CPR: Members made the following observations:
any decision regarding reprogramming or suspension under Article 23 CPR must only be used in exceptional situations, and must be
well-weighed, thoroughly justified and implemented in a cautious fashion, with indication of the programmes or priorities concerned in
order to ensure transparency and allow for verification and review;
frequent reprogramming would be counter-productive and should be avoided in order not to disrupt fund management or undermine

proposals and decisions on suspension of commitments or payments.

They set out the steps that were needed for a procedure for constant, clear and transparent collaboration at interinstitutional level.
