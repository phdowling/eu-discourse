Summary

2015/2351(INI) - 15/09/2015 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: to present the draft 2015 Joint Report of the Council and the Commission on the implementation of the renewed framework for
European cooperation in the youth field (2010-2018).
BACKGROUND: the economic crisis has hit young people particularly hard. It has widened the gap between those with more and those with
fewer opportunities.
This is why the Commission and the Member States continued working together in the period 2013-2015, to improve young peoples
employability, their integration in the labour market, their social inclusion and participation.
In the face of a growing socio-economic divide, it is necessary to identify sustainable solutions to fight youth unemployment, strengthen social
inclusion and prevent violent radicalisation. This requires more systematic cooperation across a range of policies at EU and Member State
level, such as employment, education, training, non-discrimination, social policy, citizenship (including citizenship of the Union) and youth, but
also culture, sport and health.
This report evaluates progress towards the goals and priorities of the cooperation framework in the period 2013-2015, based on an
assessment of young peoples situation and policy measures taken at EU and Member State level.
CONTENT: youth employment and employability remained top priorities throughout 2013-2015. To improve educational outcomes, Member
States took action under the European Semester to bring down early school leaving and promote higher-education attainment to reach the
Europe 2020 headline targets.
The EU and Member States undertook to reduce youth unemployment by easing transitions from education to work. In 2013, the Youth
Guarantee was introduced as a structural framework to offer young people a job, an apprenticeship, traineeship or continued education within
four months of leaving school or becoming unemployed. The ESF and the YEI set aside at least 12.7 billion for youth activation and
employment.

Further to the EU Security Agenda and the Paris Declaration, Member States undertook to step up efforts to foster the inclusion and
participation in society of all young people. In response to concerns about the growing social exclusion of young people, nearly all Member
States took measures to enhance the inclusion of NEETs (young person who is "Not in Education, Employment, or Training). Most undertook
to improve young peoples access to quality services and 80 % supported youth work and youth centres. However, youth work has suffered
from budget cuts across Europe, while the growing share of youth at risk of poverty and exclusion increases the demand for intervention.
As regards governance and the implementation of the youth cooperation framework in 2013-2015, the framework encouraged cross-sectorial
cooperation. Nearly all Member States now have institutionalised mechanisms to ensure a cross-sectoral approach to youth policy, such as
inter-departmental structures and regular inter-ministerial meetings. The Structured Dialogue has yet to fulfil its full potential: It still fails to
reach a wider group of young people with fewer resources and a weaker political voice.
Proposals for the way forward 2016-2018: the report noted that in 2016-2018, the cooperation framework for youth should aim to empower
more and more diverse young people, especially those at risk of exclusion.
It should help them find quality jobs and participate in social life. EU funding under the Erasmus+ programme, European Social Fund (ESF)
and the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) will complement policy cooperation on youth work, volunteering and participation in democratic life.
The future work cycle of the cooperation framework should prioritise:
1. increased social inclusion of all young people, especially those at risk such as NEETs and young people with a migrant background;
2. stronger participation of all young people, in particular those at risk of marginalisation;
3. easier integration into the labour market for all young people, with a special focus on the long-term unemployed and those in transition
from education to work.
The Commission and Member States will take action in these areas, including through the frameworks instruments and cooperation with other
policies as appropriate, to promote:
social inclusion and outreach practices to reach young people of diverse backgrounds, especially those suffering from disadvantages;
the capacity of youth work, youth organisations and networks and the recognition of quality youth work;
evolving skills demands, including citizenship, media and digital literacy, critical judgment and intercultural understanding;
volunteering, including through EU programmes such as the EVS and the new EU aid volunteers initiative.

2015/2351(INI) - 28/07/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Culture and Education adopted an own-initiative report by Andrea BOCSKOR (EPP, HU) on the assessment of the EU
Youth Strategy 2013-2015, in response to the 2015 Joint Report of the Council and the Commission on the implementation of the renewed
framework for European cooperation in the youth field (2010-2018).
General recommendations: Members recommended the EU, national, regional and local authorities to make sure that the different
programmes at EU level dealing with youth policies are well communicated, implemented, coordinated, in order to respond to new needs with
a view to the social and educational challenges to come. It views the open method of coordination as an appropriate but still insufficient as a
means for framing youth policies that needs to be complemented by other measures.
Given the EUs alarmingly high youth unemployment, the high and widely varying percentages of young people not in education, employment
or training (NEETs), and the challenges of youth poverty and social exclusion, Members stressed that the next cycle (2016-2018) should
contribute to the two objectives of the EU Youth Strategy:
by identifying and tackling the causes of youth unemployment, such as early school leaving (the Europe 2020 headline target whereby
the proportion of early leavers from education and training should be less than 10 %);
by fostering entrepreneurship among young people;
by investing in education, internships, apprenticeships and vocational training in the skills that reflect labour market opportunities,
needs and developments;
by facilitating the transition to the labour market in terms of measures ensuring better coordination of education programmes,
employment policy and labour market demands.
The report noted that it is essential that the next cycle of the EU Youth Strategy should include young refugees and asylum seekers.
Effective implementation of the EU Youth Strategy should be closely linked to achieving the Europe 2020 headline targets, particularly those of
having 75 % of the population aged 20 to 64 in employment and lifting as many young people as possible out of poverty and social exclusion.
The report stressed the importance of changes made to the European Job Mobility Portal (EURES), in order to improve youth employment
opportunities and achieve greater social cohesion.
The EU and the Member States are called upon to take advantage of those technologies to strengthen the dialogue with young people and
their capacity to participate in society. In this regard, the report stressed the importance of involving young people and youth organisations in
shaping the priorities and drafting a new EU Youth Cooperation Framework after 2018.
Employment and education: Members called on the Member States to make the best use of available EU and national policies and financial
frameworks in order to promote appropriate investment in young people and the creation of quality and secure jobs. They insisted on the need
to:
fully implement the Erasmus+ programme, especially its apprenticeships facet;
improve opportunities for vocational education and training (VET) students to do work placements in neighbouring countries in order to
foster a better understanding of other Member States labour and training practices;
boost information and communication technologies (ICT) training in order to equip all young people with the relevant e-skills useful for
the labour market, for example by reallocating funding within the Youth Employment Initiative;
pursue youth and education programmes that empower young women and girls and facilitate their entry into traditionally
male-dominated sectors where they are under-represented, such as entrepreneurship, ICT, and science, technology, engineering and
mathematics (STEM);

ensure that young people have the opportunity to attain at least basic digital skills and acquire knowledge and understanding about
the media, in order to work, to learn and to participate actively in modern society;
continue the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) and ensure better coordination at all levels between education and training curricula
and the needs of the changing labour markets;
implement measures to facilitate young peoples transition from education to work, including by ensuring quality internships and
apprenticeships;
take measures to incentivise entrepreneurship by creating a more entrepreneur- and start-up-friendly environment for the launch of
business start-ups, which could include schemes and measures for easy provision of credit by banks, simplified regulation and tax
relief schemes and measures enabling young people to go ahead with their own business ideas.
Financial resources: Members underlined the importance of strategic investment, including from the European Structural and Investment
Funds, in particular the European Social Fund, for regional development, competitiveness and the creation of high-quality traineeships,
apprenticeships and sustainable jobs.
Members called for targeted and simplified measures to enhance Member State capacity to make use of available funding through the
European Structural Funds, the European Social Fund, the European Regional Development Fund, the European Cohesion Fund, the
European Fund for Strategic Investment (EFSI), the Youth Employment Initiative, Youth on the Move, Your First Eures Job, Horizon 2020 and
programmes and actions in the area of citizenship.
Member States are urged to fully implement and monitor the effectiveness of the Youth Guarantee. This guarantee should also focus on
education and training for unskilled or low-skilled unemployed young people, so as also to cover young graduates and those who have
completed vocational training. The age limit under the Youth Guarantee should go from 25 to 29.
Lastly, Members called on all Member States to introduce a minimum guaranteed income, in order to offer young people who have finished
school and university the resources they need to live decently until they find work.

2015/2351(INI) - 27/10/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 432 votes to 131 with 55 abstentions a resolution on the assessment of the EU Youth Strategy
2013-2015, in response to the 2015 Joint Report of the Council and the Commission on the implementation of the renewed framework for
European cooperation in the youth field (2010-2018).
To recall, the EU Youth Strategy (2010-2018) has eight main fields of action in which initiatives should be taken education and training,
employment and entrepreneurship, health and well-being, participation, voluntary activities, social inclusion, youth and the world as well as
creativity and culture.
General recommendations: Parliament recommended making sure that the different programmes at EU level dealing with youth policies are
well communicated, implemented, coordinated, in order to respond to new needs with a view to the social and educational challenges to come.
It views the open method of coordination as an appropriate but still insufficient as a means for framing youth policies that needs to be
complemented by other measures. Members reiterated their call for closer cooperation and exchange of best practices on youth issues at
local, regional, national and EU level, as well as clear indicators and benchmarks in order to allow for monitoring of progress.
Priorities for the next cycle (2016-2018): given the EUs alarmingly high youth unemployment, the high percentages of young people not in
education, employment or training (NEETs), and the challenges of youth poverty and social exclusion, Parliament stressed that the next cycle
(2016-2018) should contribute to the two objectives of the EU Youth Strategy:
by identifying and tackling the causes of youth unemployment, such as early school leaving (the Europe 2020 headline target whereby
the proportion of early leavers from education and training should be less than 10 %);
by fostering entrepreneurship among young people;
by investing in education, internships, apprenticeships and vocational training in the skills that reflect labour market opportunities,
needs and developments;
by facilitating the transition to the labour market in terms of measures ensuring better coordination of education programmes,
employment policy and labour market demands.
The resolution also stressed the importance of the following:
guaranteeing that young people are either in employment, in education or undergoing vocational (re)training at the latest, four months
after leaving school;
ensuring that the next cycle Strategy includes young refugees and asylum seekers under its objectives;
ensuring the inclusion of youth with disability in employment;
lifting as many young people as possible out of poverty and social exclusion;
high-quality cooperation, geared to the needs of the individual child or young person, including between families, religious
communities and schools, and local communities, in guiding young people towards full integration in society;
strengthening dialogue with young people and their capacity to participate in society, and involving young people and youth
organisations in shaping the priorities and drafting a new EU Youth Cooperation Framework after 2018;
promoting a EU dimension in education with the aim of preparing learners to live and work in an increasingly complex and integrated
Union.
Employment and education: Parliament called on Member States to make the best use of available EU and national policies and financial
frameworks in order to promote appropriate investment in young people and the creation of quality and secure jobs. It insisted on the need to:
fully implement the Erasmus+ programme, especially its apprenticeships facet;
improve opportunities for vocational education and training (VET) students to do work placements in neighbouring countries ;
boost information and communication technologies (ICT) training in order to equip all young people with the relevant skills and basic
digital skills useful for the labour market;
pursue youth and education programmes that empower young women and girls in traditionally male-dominated sectors where they are

under-represented, such as entrepreneurship, ICT, and science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM);
continue the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) and ensure better coordination at all levels between education and training curricula
and the needs of the changing labour markets;
ensure better coordination at all levels between education and training curricula and the needs of the changing labour markets;
implement measures to facilitate young peoples transition from education to work, including by ensuring quality internships and
apprenticeships;
take measures to incentivise entrepreneurship in all forms of education by creating a more entrepreneur- and start-up-friendly
environment for the launch of business start-ups, and enhance the role of the Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs programme;
encourage Member States to establish quality dual education and vocational training systems.
Financial resources: Parliament underlined the importance of strategic investment, including from the European Structural and Investment
Funds, in particular the European Social Fund, for regional development, competitiveness and the creation of high-quality traineeships,
apprenticeships and sustainable jobs.
Members called for targeted and simplified measures to enhance Member State capacity to make use of available funding through the
European Structural Funds, the European Social Fund, the European Regional Development Fund, the European Cohesion Fund, the
European Fund for Strategic Investment (EFSI), the Youth Employment Initiative, Youth on the Move, Your First Eures Job, Horizon 2020 and
programmes and actions in the area of citizenship.

education and training for unskilled or low-skilled unemployed young people, so as also to cover young graduates and those who have
completed vocational training. The age limit under the Youth Guarantee should go from 25 to 29.
Lastly, Parliament felt that the European Job Mobility Portal (EURES) required changes, in order to improve youth employment opportunities
and achieve greater social cohesion.
