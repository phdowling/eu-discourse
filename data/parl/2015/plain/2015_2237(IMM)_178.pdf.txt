Summary

2015/2237(IMM) - 14/07/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Legal Affairs adopted the report by Tadeusz ZWIEFKA (EPP, PL) in which it recommended the European Parliament to
waive the immunity of István UJHELYI (S&D, HU).
Members recalled that the Central District Court of Pest (HU) requested the waiver of the parliamentary immunity of a Member of the

European Parliament, István Ujhelyi, in connection with criminal proceedings for defamation during a programme broadcast by the Hungarian
TV channel ATV in which he is accused of referring to Tamás Sneider as being related to the mafia.
The statements in question were made on 25 April 2014, at a time when István Ujhelyi was not a Member of the European Parliament, but a
Member of the National Parliament.
The charges against István Ujhelyi do not relate to an opinion expressed or vote cast by him in the performance of his duties as a Member of
the European Parliament and the absolute immunity in accordance with Article 8 of Protocol No 7 is therefore not applicable .
Therefore, Members recommended the European Parliament to waive the immunity of István Ujhelyi.
