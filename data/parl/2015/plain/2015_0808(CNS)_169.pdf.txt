2015/0808(CNS) - 24/08/2015 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to approve the conclusion, by the European Police Office (Europol), of the Agreement on Operational and Strategic Cooperation
between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Europol.
PROPOSED ACT: Council implementing decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to
follow its opinion.
BACKGROUND: pursuant to Decision 2009/371/JHA establishing the European Police Office (Europol) and Decision 2009/934/JHA adopting
the implementing rules governing Europol's relations with partners, including the exchange of personal data and classified information, Europol
is to conclude agreements with the third States which have been put on the list determined by Decision 2009/935/JHA.
Such agreements have the objective of supporting and strengthening action by the competent authorities of the Member States and their
mutual cooperation in preventing and combating organised crime, terrorism and other forms of serious crime affecting two or more Member
States, and may concern the exchange of operational, strategic or technical information, including personal data and classified information.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is included in the list determined by Decision 2009/935/JHA.
In order to increase effectiveness in preventing and combating serious forms of crime and, in particular, given that Bosnia and Herzegovina is
a potential candidate State and a close neighbour of the Union, with which Bosnia and Herzegovina has many links and exchanges, Europol
has initiated the procedure for the conclusion of an Agreement on Operational and Strategic Cooperation between Bosnia and Herzegovina
and Europol ('Operational and Strategic Agreement').
Strategic agreements may be concluded by Europol only after approval by the Council, the latter having previously consulted the Management
Board of Europol. Operational agreements require, in addition, that the Council obtain, via the Management Board, the opinion of the Joint
Supervisory Body of Europol, as far as the agreement concerns the exchange of personal data.
The Operational and Strategic Agreement received a positive opinion from the Joint Supervisory Body with regard to those provisions. The
Management Board approved the Operational and Strategic Agreement on 13 May 2015.
The conditions for triggering the exercise of the implementing powers by the Council pursuant to Decisions 2009/371/JHA, 2009/934/JHA and
2009/935/JHA have been met and an implementing decision should therefore be adopted in order to approve the conclusion of the Operational
and Strategic Agreement.
CONTENT: in accordance with the draft implementing decision, Europol shall be authorised to conclude the Agreement on Operational and
Strategic Cooperation between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Europol.
The terms of the cooperation governed by the Operational and Strategic Agreement provide for the exchange of information, which may
include specialist knowledge, general situation reports, results of strategic analysis, information on criminal investigation procedures and
information on crime-prevention methods; participation in training activities; and the provision of advice and support in individual criminal
investigations.
In addition, the Agreement contains provisions relating to the exchange of personal data.
Denmark, the United Kingdom and Ireland shall all take part in the adoption and application of this Decision.

2015/0808(CNS) - 03/12/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs adopted, in the framework of a special legislative procedure (Parliaments

consultation), the report by Lorenzo FONTANA (ENF, IT) on the draft Council implementing decision approving the conclusion by the
European Police Office (Europol) of the Agreement on Operational and Strategic Cooperation between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Europol.
The Committee recommended the European Parliament to approve the Council draft.
To recall, with regard to Council Decision 2009/371/JHA establishing the European Police Office (Europol) and Council Decision
2009/934/JHA adopting the implementing rules governing Europols relations with partners, Europol must conclude the agreements with the
third States which are laid down in the list established by Council Decision 2009/935/JHA.
Such agreements have the objective of supporting and strengthening action by the competent authorities of the Member States and their
mutual cooperation in preventing and combating organised crime, terrorism and other forms of serious crime affecting two or more Member
States, and may concern the exchange of operational, strategic or technical information, including personal data and classified information.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is included in the list determined by Decision 2009/935/JHA.
Members called on the Commission to:
assess, after the entry into force of the new Europol Regulation, the provisions contained in the cooperation agreement, in particular
on data protection;
inform the Parliament and the Council of the outcome of this assessment and, if appropriate, to submit a recommendation for an
authorisation to open international renegotiation of the agreement.

2015/0808(CNS) - 16/12/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 314 votes to 181, with 68 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the draft Council implementing decision
approving the conclusion by the European Police Office (Europol) of the Agreement on Operational and Strategic Cooperation between Bosnia
and Herzegovina and Europol.
Parliament approved the Council draft under the Parliaments consultation procedure. It called on the Commission to:
assess, after the entry into force of the new Europol Regulation, the provisions contained in the cooperation agreement, in particular
on data protection;
inform the Parliament and the Council of the outcome of this assessment and, if appropriate, to submit a recommendation for an
