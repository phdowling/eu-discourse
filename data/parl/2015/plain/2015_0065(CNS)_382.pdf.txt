OJ L 301 18.11.2015, p. 0001 Summary

2015/0065(CNS) - 18/03/2015 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to repeal Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to
follow its opinion.
BACKGROUND: in 2003, the Council adopted Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income received in the form of interest

payments (the Savings Directive). This Directive served two main purposes: (i) avoiding distortions to the movement of capital and (ii) allowing
effective taxation of interest payments made from paying agents established in one Member State to individuals resident in another Member
State.
The amendments made to Council Directive 2011/16/EU on Administrative Cooperation in the Field of Taxation by Council Directive
2014/107/EU of December 2014 extended the automatic exchange of information to a full range of income in accordance with the Global
Standard released by the OECD Council in July 2014 and ensured a coherent, consistent and comprehensive Union-wide approach to the
automatic exchange of financial account information in the Internal Market. EU law is now fully aligned with the new global standard.
In order to make sure that there is only one applicable standard for automatic exchange of information within the EU, and to avoid situations
where two standards are applied in parallel, the 2003 Directive should be repealed.
CONTENT: the proposal provides for the repeal of Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income. In order not to leave any
gaps in the reporting, the repeal of the Savings Directive needs to be well coordinated with the timing of the application of the 2014 Amending
Directive on Administrative Cooperation.
Specifically, the proposal to repeal Directive 2003/48/EC also involves the temporary exceptions necessary to protect acquired rights and to
take account of the derogation allowed to Austria under Directive 2014/107/EU.
Directive 2003/48/EC will be repealed with effect from 1 January 2016. However, certain obligations shall continue to apply.
Directive 2003/48/EC shall continue to apply in its entirety with regard to Austria for an additional one year (until 31 December 2016).

2015/0065(CNS) - 16/10/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs adopted, in the framework of a special legislative procedure (Parliaments consultation), the
report by Molly SCOTT CATO (Greens/ALE, UK) on the proposal for a Council directive repealing Council Directive 2003/48/EC on taxation of
savings income in the form of interest payments.
The committee approved the Commission proposal subject to amendment introduced in the form of recitals.
Whilst supporting the proposal to repeal the Directive, Members expressed their concern about the potential for the creation of loopholes if the
separate bilateral agreements between the Union and five European countries that are not Member States of the Union (Switzerland,
Liechtenstein, San Marino, Monaco and Andorra) are not rapidly concluded. They also regretted that the Commission does not have a
mandate to negotiate with the 12 dependent or associated territories (the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man and the dependent or associated
territories in the Caribbean).
Members consider it important that the Commission continues to monitor that the repeal does not create loopholes. The report proposed that
the Commission shall:
by 1 July 2016, submit a report to the Council and to the European Parliament on the transition of moving from the reporting standard
applied under Directive 2003/48/EC to the new reporting standard established by Directive 2014/107/EU;
by 1 October 2017, submit a follow-up report in order to closely monitor the situation. The reports shall, where appropriate, be
accompanied by legislative proposals.

2015/0065(CNS) - 27/10/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 629 votes to 30, with 29 abstentions, in the framework of a special legislative procedure (Parliaments
consultation), a legislative resolution on the proposal for a Council directive repealing Council Directive 2003/48/EC on taxation of savings
income in the form of interest payments.
Parliament approved the Commission proposal subject to amendment introduced in the form of recitals.
Given that all of the bilateral agreements are adapted to the new OECD Global Standard and to Directive 2014/107/EU, Parliament expressed
its concern about the potential for the creation of loopholes if the separate bilateral agreements between the Union and five European
countries that are not Member States of the Union (Switzerland, Liechtenstein, San Marino, Monaco and Andorra) are not rapidly concluded. It
also regretted that the Commission does not have a mandate to negotiate with the 12 dependent or associated territories (the Channel Islands,
the Isle of Man and the dependent or associated territories in the Caribbean).
Members considered it important that the Commission should continue to monitor that the repeal does not create loopholes. They proposed
that the Commission shall:
by 1 July 2016, submit a report to the Council and to the European Parliament on the transition of moving from the reporting standard
applied under Directive 2003/48/EC to the new reporting standard established by Directive 2014/107/EU;
by 1 October 2017, submit a follow-up report in order to closely monitor the situation. The reports shall, where appropriate, be
accompanied by legislative proposals.
Lastly, Parliament stressed that although no specific cost-benefit analysis has been made of a dual reporting system, not even for a temporary
transition period between the two standards, it is reasonable to assume that the minor benefits of retaining such dual reporting would be
outweighed by the costs.

2015/0065(CNS) - 10/11/2015 Final act
PURPOSE: to repeal Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments, involving the temporary

exceptions necessary to protect acquired rights and to take account of the derogation allowed to Austria under Directive 2014/107/EU.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Council Directive (EU) 2015/2060 repealing Directive 2003/48/EC on taxation of savings income in the form of interest
payments.
CONTENT: the Directive provides for the repeal of Directive 2003/48/EC on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments in
order to ensure that there is only one applicable standard for automatic exchange of information within the EU (the OECDs Global Standard)
and to avoid situations where two standards are applied in parallel.
To ensure the seamless continuation of automatic reporting of financial account information, the repeal of Directive 2003/48/EC will apply on
the same day as the date of application of Directive 2014/107/EU amending Directive 2011/16/EU as regards mandatory automatic exchange
of information in the field of taxation.
Accordingly, the repeal of the Directive also involves the temporary exceptions necessary to protect acquired rights and to take account of the
derogation allowed to Austria under Directive 2014/107/EU.
Directive 2003/48/EC will be repealed with effect from 1 January 2016. However, certain obligations shall continue to apply.
Directive 2003/48/EC shall continue to apply in its entirety with regard to Austria for an additional one year (until 31 December 2016).
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 8.12.2015.
