Regulation 2015/779
OJ L 126 21.05.2015, p. 0001 Summary

2015/0026(COD) - 04/02/2015 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to increase the initial pre-financing amount paid to operational programmes supported by the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI).
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: in light of the persistent high levels of youth unemployment in the Union, a Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) was established
to provide support to 7 million young Europeans not in employment, education or training in the most affected regions. The YEI is integrated in
the programming of the European Social Fund (ESF).
To ensure a quick response to fighting youth unemployment, Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and the Council
laying down general provisions on the five European Structural and Investment Funds (ESI Funds) and Regulation (EU) No 1304/2013 on the
European Social Funds lay down provisions to allow for a quicker mobilisation of the resources allocated to the YEI, including, inter alia, the
commitment of all the resources in the first two years of the programming period.
Operations under the YEI therefore have to be implemented, in principle, by the end of 2018 and not 2023 as it is the case for other operations
supported by the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESI Funds), including the European Social Fund.
The budgetary constraints faced by Member states and the lack of available funding at the initial stage of the programming period have
caused significant delays in the implementation of the YEI.
In its Work Programme for 2015, the Commission committed to take initiatives to promote integration and employability in the labour market,
including measures to support Member States in getting young people into work.
Taking into account the urgent need to address youth unemployment, the Commission states that it is necessary to increase the level of the
initial pre-financing paid to operational programmes supported by the YEI in 2015.
CONTENT: it is proposed to introduce an additional provision in Regulation (EU) No 1304/2013 on the additional initial pre-financing for
operational programmes supported by the YEI.
In concrete terms, the proposal aims to increase the initial pre-financing amount paid to operational programmes supported by the Youth
Employment Initiative (YEI) from 1-1.5% as outlined in Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 to a maximum of 30% of the envelope which is
allocated to it for 2015.
To ensure that the additional initial pre-financing amount is used for the immediate implementation of the YEI, the proposal foresees that this
amount is reimbursed to the Commission, if the Union contribution from the YEI does not amount to an adequate level in interim payment
applications submitted to the Commission 12 months after the entry into force of this Regulation.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposed modification does not imply any changes in the Multiannual Financial Framework annual ceilings
for commitments and payments as per Annex I of Regulation (EU) No 1311/2013.
The annual breakdown of commitment appropriations for the YEI remains unchanged.
The increased need for payment appropriations for the YEI additional initial pre-financing in 2015 will be fully covered by appropriations of the
2015 budget for the YEI specific allocation. Consequently, the proposed modification should not trigger a potential backlog of 2014-2020
unpaid claims.

2015/0026(COD) - 21/04/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs adopted the report by Elisabeth MORIN-CHARTIER (EPP, FR) on the proposal for a
regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) No 1304/2013 of the European Parliament and the
Council on the European Social Fund, as regards an increase of the initial pre-financing amount paid to operational programmes supported by
the Youth Employment Initiative.
The committee recommended the European Parliament to adopt its position at first reading, taking over the Commission proposal.
Given the urgency to deal with youth unemployment, the Commissions proposal seeks to raise the initial pre-financing amount paid to
operational programmes supported by the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) from 1% to 30% of the envelope which is allocated to it for 2015.
The YEI is integrated in the programming of the European Social Fund (ESF).

2015/0026(COD) - 29/04/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 632 votes to 30, with 31 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) No 1304/2013 of the European Parliament and the Council on the

European Social Fund, as regards an increase of the initial pre-financing amount paid to operational programmes supported by the Youth
Employment Initiative.
Parliament adopted its position at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure taking over the Commission proposal.
To attenuate the budgetary constraints faced by Member states and the lack of available funding at the initial stage of the programming period
have caused significant delays in the implementation of the YEI and to take account of the urgency to deal with youth unemployment, the
proposed Regulation seeks to raise the initial pre-financing amount paid to operational programmes supported by the Youth Employment
Initiative (YEI) from 1% to 30% of the envelope which is allocated to it for 2015.
In light of the persistent high levels of youth unemployment in the Union, a Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) was established to provide
support to young Europeans not in employment, education or training in the most affected regions. The YEI is integrated in the programming of
the European Social Fund (ESF).

2015/0026(COD) - 20/05/2015 Final act
PURPOSE: to increase the initial pre-financing amount paid to operational programmes supported by the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI).
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Regulation (EU) 2015/779 of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) No 1304/2013, as
regards an additional initial prefinancing amount paid to operational programmes supported by the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI).
CONTENT: this Regulation introduced an additional provision in Regulation (EU) No 1304/2013 on the additional initial pre-financing for
operational programmes supported by the YEI.
In light of the persistently high levels of youth unemployment in the Union, the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) was established to provide
support to young persons not in employment, education or training in the most affected regions.
In order to address the budgetary constraints faced by Member States at the initial stage of the programming period and taking into account
the urgent need to address youth unemployment and the specific features of the YEI, the Regulation increases the level of the initial
prefinancing paid to operational programmes supported by the YEI in 2015 from 1% to 30%.
To ensure that the additional initial prefinancing amount is used for the immediate implementation of the YEI, that amount should be
reimbursed to the Commission should the Union contribution from the YEI not amount to an adequate level in interim payment applications
submitted to the Commission within 12 months after the entry into force of this Regulation.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 22.5.2015.
