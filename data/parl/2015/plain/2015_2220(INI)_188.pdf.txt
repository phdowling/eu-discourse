2015/2220(INI) - 08/03/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Foreign Affairs adopted the own-initiative report by Tamás MESZERICS (Greens/EFA, HU) on the implementation and
review of the EU-Central Asia Strategy.
General provisions on EU commitments: Members stressed the strong strategic, political and economic interest of the EU in strengthening its
bilateral and multilateral relations with all the Central Asian countries, on the basis of common shared values as stated in the existing
Partnership and Cooperation Agreements between the EU and Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan and in the agreement albeit not yet in force - with Turkmenistan.
They pointed out, however, that the strategic approach adopted to date to shaping relations with Central Asian countries has demonstrated
only limited viability and success. They called on the EU and the five Central Asian countries to make serious efforts to achieve the aims and
goals of this strategy.
On the other hand, Members welcomed the review of the EU-Central Asia Strategy conducted by the EEAS, the Commission and the Council
in 2015. Nevertheless, they took the view that the priorities, objectives and targets should be aligned more specifically to the interests,
requirements and framework conditions of the Central Asian partner states, taking account of the differences between the countries of the
region and of the uniqueness of each. It should be more precisely defined through individual, tailor-made country action plans, and
accompanied by benchmarks and indicators with a reasonable timeframe for completion.
In this regard, the EU is called upon to:
cooperate more intensively on an ad hoc basis with those Central Asian countries that wish to go beyond the EU Strategy for Central
Asia;
ensure that the disbursement of EU funds should be clearly incentive- and performance-based;
increase its political visibility in the Central Asia region;
adopt a concrete action plan with measureable benchmarks enabling proper evaluation of progress made in the future.
cooperate with the aid and development projects of the US in the fields of human security, environment, education and climate policy.
Members welcomed the re-establishment of the post of EU Special Representative (EUSR) for Central Asia after a year-long gap, and
expected that the newly appointed EUSR will make an important contribution to the implementation of the strategy.
Democratisation, human rights and the rule of law: Members stressed that respect for human rights and democracy must be at the core of the
EU strategy. They regretted that overall respect for democratic standards, human rights and fundamental freedoms has not yet reached an
acceptable level. The report recommended the EU to tailor its human rights policy and external financing instruments better, keeping a
consistent long-term democratic reform as the guiding light.
Strongly condemning the continued persecution of human rights defenders, opposition political figures and journalists in Turkmenistan,
Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan, Members called on the EEAS to use all means at its disposal to act swiftly in their
defence.
The report noted that the EU must make it a priority to promote freedom of religion and belief and the rights of women, minors and minorities.

More specifically, as regards women, the Central Asian countries are called upon to treat violence against women as a criminal offence, to
properly investigate all reported cases and to implement measures to guarantee protection, assistance and access to justice for victims.
Education and youth: the EU is urged to devote more attention to the promotion of quality education among young people in the Central Asian
countries, given the positive effects in terms of social inclusion, social cohesion and stability, and building sustainable democratic societies,
and as the best form of prevention against violent extremism and radicalisation among youth in the region.
They consider that the EU's positive role in the region should be advanced via education and people-to-people contacts. In this regard, they
recalled the importance of the EUs international exchange programmes, such as Erasmus +, Erasmus Mundus and Erasmus Tempus.
Economic integration, trade and sustainable development: concerned at the lack of socio-economic development, which is stalled and uneven,
the lack of state transparency and the consequent corruption, poor governance, weak institutional framework, lack of respect for the rule of law
and low participation of civil society, Members stressed the need for the EU to further step up trade and investment relations with the Central
Asian countries and for these countries to tackle corruption and promote a stable environment in order to attract foreign investment.
As regards development aid, Members are of the opinion that development aid should be disbursed only in countries with a genuine
commitment to the alleviation of poverty, equal and sustainable socioeconomic progress and respect for human rights, and that those
countries must demonstrate that they have effective anti-corruption policies and allow the EU to monitor implementation of the corresponding
efforts.
Members encouraged the mainstreaming of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the EU's development agenda in the region and
reiterated that including the SDGs will result in more comprehensive sustainable development in the Central Asia region.
Energy, environment, water, and transport: the report stressed the need for more intensive dialogue on infrastructure development, including
energy and transport networks as well as high-capacity internet connections. It regards the region as an additional potential source of energy
security for the EU, with particular reference to the potential for increased cooperation with Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan.
Regional cooperation, security challenges and border management: highlighting the importance of cooperation between the EU and the
countries of Central Asia in preventing and combating terrorism, Members are deeply concerned about the activities of the extremist
organisation Islamic State (IS) in recruiting growing numbers of Central Asian citizens to travel to the Middle East to fight or otherwise support
IS, Al-Nusra and other terrorist and extremist organisations, prompted in part by political marginalisation and bleak economic prospects. They
recognise that should a significant portion of radicalised Central Asian citizens return to their home countries, they risk challenging security and
stability throughout Central Asia, Afghanistan, Iran, Russia, China and India.
Members called on the Council, the Commission and the EEAS to prioritise in their relations with the Central Asian states the reform of the
security sector, including better funding and training, promoting religious freedom in the framework of the secular constitutions, preventive
aspects of countering terrorism and efforts at rehabilitating former jihadists, as components of an overall strategy for dealing with the challenge
of Islamist extremism.
Lastly, the report called on all international parties with influence in the region to encourage Central Asian states to make a concerted effort to
better coordinate cooperation between their security services, including with respect to intelligence-sharing.

2015/2220(INI) - 13/04/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 605 votes to 66 with 25 abstentions, a resolution on the implementation and review of the EU-Central
Asia Strategy.
General provisions on EU commitments: Members stressed the strong strategic, political and economic interest of the EU in strengthening its
bilateral and multilateral relations with all the Central Asian countries, on the basis of common shared values as stated in the existing
Partnership and Cooperation Agreements between the EU and Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan and in the agreement albeit not yet in force - with Turkmenistan.
They pointed out, however, that the strategic approach adopted to date to shaping relations with Central Asian countries has demonstrated

requirements and framework conditions of the Central Asian partner states, taking account of the differences between the countries of the
region and of the uniqueness of each. The objectives should be more precisely defined through individual, tailor-made country action plans,
and accompanied by benchmarks and indicators with a reasonable timeframe for completion.
In this regard, the EU is called upon to:
·

cooperate more intensively on an ad hoc basis with those Central Asian countries that wish to go beyond the EU Strategy for Central
Asia;

·

ensure that the that the disbursement of EU funds is based on measurable progress with regard, in particular, to the fields of
democratisation, preventing and fighting corruption, free and fair elections, human rights, ending drug trafficking, respect for labour
rules, good governance, the rule of law, development, human security and good neighbourly relations.

Members welcomed the re-establishment of the post of EU Special Representative (EUSR) for Central Asia and expected that the newly
appointed EUSR will make an important contribution to the implementation of the strategy.
Democratisation, human rights and the rule of law: Parliament stressed that respect for human rights and democracy must be at the core of
the EU strategy. It regretted that overall respect for democratic standards, human rights and fundamental freedoms has not yet reached an
acceptable level. It recommended the EU to tailor its human rights policy and external financing instruments better, keeping a consistent

they recalled the importance of the EUs international exchange programmes, such as Erasmus +, Erasmus Mundus and Erasmus Tempus.
Economic integration, trade and sustainable development: Members underlined the growing importance of trade relations between the EU and
Central Asia, with the EU now the first trading partner in the region.
Concerned at the lack of socio-economic development, which is stalled and uneven, the lack of state transparency and the consequent
corruption, poor governance, weak institutional framework, lack of respect for the rule of law and low participation of civil society, Members
stressed the need for the EU to further step up trade and investment relations with the Central Asian countries and for these countries to tackle

efforts.
Parliament encouraged the mainstreaming of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the EU's development agenda in the region and
reiterated that including the SDGs will result in more comprehensive sustainable development in the Central Asia region.
Energy, environment, water, and transport: underlining the need for energy supply and diversification to be a key element of the EU-Central
Asia strategy, Parliament stressed the need for more intensive dialogue on infrastructure development, including energy and transport
networks as well as high-capacity internet connections. It regarded the region as an additional potential source of energy security for the EU,
with particular reference to the potential for increased cooperation with Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. It called for renewed efforts to cope
with and tackle the dramatic consequences of the environmental disaster of the drying-up of the Aral Sea.
Regional cooperation, security challenges and border management: Parliament supported the EUs long-term goal of transforming the nascent
EU-Central Asia High- Level Security Dialogue into a genuine forum for cooperation in addressing common security challenges in the region
and beyond its borders. It highlighted the need to closer interlink the EUs approach to Central Asia with Afghanistan and adapt existing policies
to the post-2014 strategy for Afghanistan.
Stressing the importance of cooperation between the EU and the countries of Central Asia in preventing and combating terrorism, Members
were deeply concerned about the activities of the extremist organisation Islamic State (IS) in recruiting growing numbers of Central Asian
citizens to travel to the Middle East to fight or otherwise support IS, Al-Nusra and other terrorist and extremist organisations, prompted in part
by political marginalisation and bleak economic prospects. They recognised that should a significant portion of radicalised Central Asian
citizens return to their home countries, they risk challenging security and stability throughout Central Asia, Afghanistan, Iran, Russia, China

better coordinate cooperation between their security services, including with respect to intelligence-sharing.
