2015/2039(INI) - 31/03/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Culture and Education adopted an own-initiative report by Krystyna ?YBACKA (S&D, PL) on follow-up on the
implementation of the Bologna Process.
Members consider that the Bologna reforms resulted in the launching of a European Higher Education Area (EHEA), and have allowed
achievements in the past 15 years in making higher education structures more comparable, increasing mobility, providing quality assurance
systems and in the recognition of diplomas, improving the quality of educational systems as well as the attractiveness of higher education in
Europe.
However, there is still much work to be done in the Bologna Process in the area of adjusting educational systems to labour market needs and
improving overall employability and competitiveness, as well as the attractiveness of higher education in Europe.
Members call on higher education institutions (HEIs), public administrations, social partners and enterprises to lead an ongoing dialogue
facilitating and enhancing employability of students.
According to the Members, the main issues and priorities are the following:
·

to further improve and update the assessment of higher educational establishments, against the standards previously set by
education systems at international level and rewarding excellence with a view to the advancement of knowledge, research and
science;

·

to increase student grants and ensure that they are easily accessible;

·

to strengthen quality assurance in order to achieve an EHEA that improves its attractiveness as a reference of academic excellence
worldwide;

·

to further develop study programmes with clearly defined objectives;

·

to implement, within the European area of higher education, the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS);

·

to guarantee the mutual recognition and compatibility of academic degrees;

·

to pursue efforts to make national QFs compatible with those of the EHEA and with European QFs;

·

to strengthen the implementation of the Mobility Strategy 2020 for EHEA to reach the quantitative target of 20% for student mobility
by 2020;

·

to gradually incorporate of student mobility into official university curricula;

·

to assess, in the context of the criteria for ranking universities and further education establishments, the level of partnership and of
European and international mobility;

·

to strengthen mobility by fostering language learning, removing administrative obstacles, providing adequate financial supports
mechanism and guaranteeing the transferability of grants, scholarships and credits;

·

to strengthen dialogue and the use of national and cross-border cooperation on programmes and internships, between universities

and businesses, which could contribute to the fight against economic crisis;
·

to provide broad opportunities for Lifelong Learning (LLL);

·

to allow recognised refugees access all institutions in the EHEA that can enable them to build up an independent life via education;

·

to increase the involvement of secondary school teachers in the Bologna Process in terms

·

of promoting quality in teacher training and professional mobility;

·

to focus on economic and social efforts to improve social inclusion by providing fair and open access to quality education for all;

·

to further develop a strategy for the external dimension of the EHEA, through cooperation with other regions of the world.

Members encourage support for countries encountering difficulties in implementing these Reforms.
Lastly, they warn that any cuts in Horizon 2020 would undoubtedly affect the full implementation of the Bologna Process, and therefore urges
the Commission to withdraw any such proposal.

2015/2039(INI) - 28/04/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 557 votes to 119, with 16 abstentions, a resolution on the follow-up on the implementation of the
Bologna Process.
An alternative motion for a resolution, tabled by the GUE/NGL Group, was rejected at plenary.
Parliament stressed the importance of the Bologna Process in the current economic situation should lie in pursuing the goals of developing the
highest possible level of knowledge and innovation for citizens through broad access to education and its constant updating.
The Bologna reforms resulted in the launching of a European Higher Education Area (EHEA), and have allowed achievements in the past 15
years. However, Parliament considered that there is still much work to be done in the Bologna Process in the area of adjusting educational
systems to labour market needs and improving overall employability and competitiveness, as well as the attractiveness of higher education in
Europe.
According to Members, the European higher education institutions (HEIs) should be able to react quickly to the economic, cultural, scientific
and technological changes in the modern society in order to fully use their potential to encourage growth, employability and social cohesion.
The resolution focused on the main challenges and priorities as follows:
to encourage support for countries encountering difficulties in implementing these reforms; supports, in this regard, the creation of
broad partnerships between countries, regions, and relevant stakeholders;
further improve and update the assessment of higher educational establishments, against the standards previously set by education
systems at international level and rewarding excellence with a view to the advancement of knowledge, research and science;
to increase student grants and ensure that they are easily accessible;
to further develop study programmes with clearly defined objectives;
to implement, within the European area of higher education, the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS);
to guarantee the mutual recognition and compatibility of academic degrees;
to pursue efforts to make national QFs compatible with those of the EHEA and with European QFs;
to strengthen the implementation of the Mobility Strategy 2020 for EHEA to reach the quantitative target of 20% for student mobility by
2020;
to gradually incorporate of student mobility into official university curricula;
to assess, in the context of the criteria for ranking universities and further education establishments, the level of partnership and of
European and international mobility;
to strengthen mobility by fostering language learning, removing administrative obstacles, providing adequate financial supports
mechanism and guaranteeing the transferability of grants, scholarships and credits;
to strengthen dialogue and the use of national and cross-border cooperation on programmes and internships, between universities
and businesses, which could contribute to the fight against economic crisis;
to provide broad opportunities for Lifelong Learning (LLL);
to allow recognised refugees access all institutions in the EHEA that can enable them to build up an independent life via education;
to increase the involvement of secondary school teachers in the Bologna Process in terms of promoting quality in teacher training and
professional mobility;
to focus on economic and social efforts to improve social inclusion by providing fair and open access to quality education for all;
to further develop a strategy for the external dimension of the EHEA, through cooperation with other regions of the world.
Members called on higher education institutions (HEIs), public administrations, social partners and enterprises to lead an ongoing dialogue
facilitating and enhancing employability of students. They also called for the potential offered by new technologies, digitalisation and ICTs to be
explored in order to enrich learning and teaching, as well as to further develop a wide range of skills and new models for learning, teaching
and assessment.
Lastly, they warned that any cuts in Horizon 2020 would undoubtedly affect the full implementation of the Bologna Process, and therefore
urged the Commission to withdraw any such proposal.
