2015/2328(INI) - 07/02/2017 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Culture and Education adopted the own-initiative report by Silvia COSTA (S&D, IT) on the implementation of Regulation
(EU) No 1295/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the Creative Europe Programme (2014 to 2020) and repealing
Decisions No 1718/2006/EC, No 1855/2006/EC and No 1041/2009/EC.
Members recalled that the Creative Europe programme has the objectives of safeguarding and promoting European cultural and linguistic
diversity, and while promoting Europe's cultural heritage on the one hand and strengthening the competitiveness of the European cultural and
creative sectors on the other.
Budget and expectations of the programme: Members urged the Member States to increase the Creative Europe budget to bring it into line
with the expectations of European citizens. They regretted the lack of financial capacity continues to be one of the main obstacles for potential
applicants and the under-representation of micro-cultural operators among funded organisations and certain sectors in the Culture
sub-programme should be addressed.
As regards the next programming period, the Commission is called upon to:
enhance the programmes consistency with all relevant EU policies and other funding sources;
ensure a good coordination between the DGs in charge of Creative Europe, as well as with the Education, Audiovisual and Culture
Executive Agency (EACEA) and the Creative Europe Desk (CED);
work as closely as possible with UNESCO, the Council of Europe and the OECD;
retain the present structure of Creative Europe, while examining and better defining the specificities of the two different
sub-programmes, to strengthen the potential of the cross-sectoral strand, and to verify whether the Guarantee Fund is effective in its
implementation;
set more than the existing six areas of expertise for evaluators, in order to cope more effectively with the specific areas;
increase transparency of the contestation procedure for rejected applications;
provide training and capacity-building opportunities for cultural operators who wish to improve their skills with respect to application
procedures, overall project management and project implementation;
better support cultural operators in finding partners for the cooperation projects, through measures including but not limited to
dedicated matching sections within the most important European cultural events;
further simplify the application and reporting procedures;
use all available tools for even better promotion and dissemination of results of the implemented projects;
further simplify the financial aspects, by extending the lump-sum instrument and encouraging greater use of flat-rate reimbursements.
MEDIA sub-programme: as regards this sub-heading, Members recommended a series of improvements which seek to: (i) increase the
financing of subtitling and dubbing; (ii) extend the scope of training; (iii) support independent TV producers; (iv) support cinema networks, such
as Europa Cinemas; (v) raise the funding ceiling for European video games, in order to include projects with transnational distribution potential

(sports games, sandbox games, etc.).
Culture sub-programme: Members called on the Commission to balance the weight of the economic dimension with the intrinsic value of arts
and culture per se, and to focus more on artists and creators. They recommended that European cooperation projects take into account
innovation, mobility and extended co-productions. They also called on the Commission to introduce possible measures to limit the
disproportion between the number of beneficiaries and the number of applicants including, among other things, an increase in the budget for
the Culture Sub-programme, more adequate representation of all cultural and creative sectors, and more support for smaller-scale projects.
Members also called for: (i) the enhancement of translation for the promotion of the linguistic diversity heritage; (ii) the reintroduction of the
European Theatre Prize; (iii) actions to give the European Heritage Label more visibility; (iv) support to the European Year of Cultural Heritage
2018; (v) access of refugees versed in the arts to the Creative Europe programme to be facilitated.
Cross-sectoral strand: Members urged the Commission to develop and fully use the potential of the strand by introducing three new support
measures: (a) Creative Europe Mundus for transnational cooperation, (b) social inclusion and (c) innovative crossover and cross-sectoral
projects.
The Commission is asked to seek to achieve a geographic and sectoral balance in the Guarantee Facility, to ensure equal access for
small-scale organisations and grassroots initiatives and projects from all Member States.
The Commission is also called upon to improve the implementation of the programme with the help of the Creative Europe Desks (CEDs).
Recommendations for future generations of the programme: lastly, Members recommended that Creative Europe be continued, reviewed and
improved over the period 2021-2028, as a programme that includes all cultural and creative sectors, with emphasis on high-quality projects,
with the same value and priorities, with two sub-programmes and a cross-sectoral strand including training, audience development, market
access, social inclusion, cooperation, cross-sectoral and crossover projects and peer-to-peer learning, as well as communication, studies,
support tailored to the cultural and creative sectors, a guarantee facility, and the support for CEDs.
They underlined the intercultural dimension of the programme in the future.
Furthermore, Members called for:
the legal basis for the next programme to explicitly include the promotion of cultural and artistic quality and the intrinsic value of culture
among the objectives of the programme and the sub-programmes, as well as among the selection and evaluation criteria;
the Commission to take a proactive approach to the admission of new countries to the programme, with special status for European
Neighbourhood South and East countries;
the promotion of European film co-productions;
the Commission to assess whether it would make sense to create a European observatory on culture and creativity comparable to the
European Audiovisual Observatory.

2015/2328(INI) - 02/03/2017 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 503 votes to 80 abstentions, a resolution on the implementation of Regulation (EU) No 1295/2013 of the
European Parliament and of the Council establishing the Creative Europe Programme (2014 to 2020) and repealing Decisions No
1718/2006/EC, No 1855/2006/EC and No 1041/2009/EC.
Parliament recalled that the Creative Europe programme has the objectives of safeguarding and promoting European cultural and linguistic
diversity, and while promoting Europe's cultural heritage on the one hand and strengthening the competitiveness of the European cultural and
creative sectors on the other.
Budget and expectations of the programme: Parliament urged the Member States to increase the Creative Europe budget to bring it into line
with the expectations of European citizens and with the ambitions of each sub-programme, thus accepting that the values of cultural
production cannot be gauged in terms of economic figures alone and enabling more efficiency and better results.
It regretted the lack of financial capacity continues to be one of the main obstacles for potential applicants and the under-representation of
micro-cultural operators among funded organisations and certain sectors in the Culture sub-programme should be addressed.
As regards the next programming period, the Commission is called upon to:
enhance the programmes consistency with all relevant EU policies and other funding sources;
ensure a good coordination between the DGs in charge of Creative Europe, as well as with the Education, Audiovisual and Culture
Executive Agency (EACEA) and the Creative Europe Desk (CED);

European Theatre Prize; (iii) actions to give the European Heritage Label more visibility; (iv) support to the European Year of Cultural Heritage
2018; (v) access of refugees versed in the arts to the Creative Europe programme to be facilitated.
It recommended that the European Heritage Label be given greater visibility, and stressed the significance of the (material and immaterial)
sites concerned as regards European identity and promoting a common feeling of belonging to Europe, building the EU and learning about
diverse heritage for a better future.
Cross-sectoral strand: Parliament urged the Commission to develop and fully use the potential of the strand by introducing three new support
measures: (a) Creative Europe Mundus for transnational cooperation, (b) social inclusion and (c) innovative crossover and cross-sectoral
projects.
Parliament recalled that a specific call for refugees joining in European society was launched in 2016 within the cross-sectoral strand, to
promote and support creativity and intercultural dialogue.
The Commission is asked to seek to achieve a geographic and sectoral balance in the Guarantee Facility, to ensure equal access for
small-scale organisations and grassroots initiatives and projects from all Member States.
The Commission is also called upon to improve the implementation of the programme with the help of the Creative Europe Desks (CEDs).
