Summary

2015/2153(REG) - 09/09/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament decided to append the following interpretation to Rule 191 of the Rules of Procedure concerning the suspension or
closure of a sitting:
"If a request to suspend or close the sitting is presented, the procedure to vote on that request is to be initiated without undue delay.
The usual means of announcing plenary votes should be used and, in line with existing practice, sufficient time should be given for
Members to reach the Chamber. By analogy with the second subparagraph of Rule 152(2), if such a request has been rejected, a
similar request cannot be tabled again during the same day. In accordance with the interpretation to Rule 22(1), the President has the
right to put an end to excessive use of requests presented under this Rule."
