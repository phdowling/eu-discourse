Summary

2015/2114(INI) - 23/11/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Foreign Affairs adopted the own-initiative report by Bodil VALERO (Greens/EFA, SE) on arms export: implementation of
Common Position 2008/944/CFSP.
To recall, the Common Position 2008/944/CFSP is a legally binding framework laying down eight criteria for the export of conventional arms to
be applied by EU Member States to their licensing decisions.
Global security environment and arms exports: deeply concerned at the spread of armed conflicts, notably those in Ukraine, Syria, Iraq, Libya
and Yemen, Members found it regrettable that developments in the last two years have shown that weapons sometimes end up in the hands
of terrorists or repressive regimes or of countries where children might be recruited or used in hostilities. They deplored the fact that around
half a million people die every year as a result of armed violence and believed it is necessary to adopt effective arms export control regimes.
EU Member States are major global arms exporters, accounting in 2013 for EUR 36 711 billion in exports worldwide, of which EUR 10 735
takes place between Member States and EUR 25 976 billion to third countries. Members noted that Article 10 of the Common Position states
that considerations of economic, commercial and industrial interests by Member States shall not affect the application of the eight criteria
regulating arms exports. They regretted, however, that Article 10 is often overlooked, especially since European defence companies are
increasingly compensating for their reduced turnover in Europe through extra-EU exports.
The committee recalled that the defence industry should serve as an instrument for implementing the defence and security of the Member
States ensuring a security of supply regime in the EU, while also contributing towards the implementation of a strengthened Common Foreign
and Security Policy and Common Security and Defence Policy, given that this is important in helping ensure global stability and security. It
acknowledged the legitimacy of exports that are carried out in response to a request made to the EU in accordance with the right to
self-defence.
The Arms Trade Treaty (ATT): the report welcomed the entry into force of the ATT which, while representing a positive achievement, still has
limitations and ambiguities (unclear concepts, exception to reporting obligations, lack of sanctioning regime). It urged those Member States
that have not yet ratified the ATT to do so at the earliest opportunity.
The Common Position: Members recalled that the Common Position should lead to a coordinated approach to the arms trade that does not
affect the right of Member States to operate more restrictive national policies. They pointed out that harmonisation at European level should
not be used as a pretext for watering down stricter national rules. Members took the view that the real problem is that the Common Position is
being applied loosely and interpreted inconsistently by the Member States, and therefore they considered it crucial that a consistent and
ambitious application of the eight criteria be pursued. Members also:
considered it advisable to make arrangements for conducting independent checks and for penalties in case of infringement of the
Common Position;
encouraged a stricter application of national criteria by broadening assessments to include a focus on the situation in the country of
destination as well as on the specific military technology in question;
called for clarification of Criterion Two which requires Member States to deny an export licence only if there is a clear risk that the
military technology or equipment to be exported might be used for internal repression.
Members States were asked to:
treat the concept of risk in arms transfer licensing processes on a precautionary basis, as is standard when addressing other areas
such as terrorism, money laundering and environmental concerns;

support the creation of an independent European Arms Control Authority (EACA) under the auspices of the High Representative of the
European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy;
include a mechanism in the Common Position that would automatically freeze existing export licences for arms to countries against
which a European weapons embargo has been established after the export control license was granted;
include arms transporting and arms financing services into their arms brokering legislation;
establish an effective control system regarding possible diversions of exports.
Members called for increased coordination at working level within the Council and the EEAS in order to ensure that aspects related to conflict
prevention, development and human rights are duly taken into account.
Transparency: the committee was of the opinion that the annual reports on arms exports are significant tools in advancing the transparency of
arms trade. They found it regrettable, however, that only 21 Member States made full submissions for the 16th Annual Report. They asked for:
the introduction of a standardised reporting and submission procedure, including a deadline, for information on actual exports and
licence data, to be applied and complied with uniformly in all Member States;
enhanced consultations between Member States with regard to transfers to fragile and unstable regions or countries, in particular
those that are acting aggressively in their neighbourhood;
parliamentary oversight to be strengthened at both national and European level by means of annual reports to parliaments;.
New technologies and the issue of dual-use goods: given that technological developments make it increasingly difficult to distinguish between
pure military and pure civilian use, Members called for special attention to be paid to the Dual Use List in the light of the Wassenaar
Arrangement. Particular attention should be given to new technologies of strategic importance, such as Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems,
applied robotics and surveillance technology.
Member States were asked to make sufficient resources available to effectively implement and enforce dual-use export, brokering and transit
controls.

2015/2114(INI) - 17/12/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 249 votes to 164, with 128 abstentions, a resolution on arms export: implementation of Common
Position 2008/944/CFSP.
To recall, the Common Position 2008/944/CFSP is a legally binding framework laying down eight criteria for the export of conventional arms to
be applied by EU Member States to their licensing decisions.
Global security environment and arms exports: deeply concerned at the spread of armed conflicts, notably those in Ukraine, Syria, Iraq, Libya
and Yemen, Parliament found it regrettable that developments in the last two years have shown that weapons sometimes end up in the hands
of terrorists or repressive regimes or of countries where children might be recruited or used in hostilities. It deplored the fact that around half a
million people die every year as a result of armed violence and believed it is necessary to adopt effective arms export control regimes.
Members recalled that EU Member States are major global arms exporters, accounting in 2013 for EUR 36 711 billion in exports worldwide, of
which EUR 10 735 takes place between Member States and EUR 25 976 billion to third countries. They regretted, however, that Article 10 of
the Common Position is often overlooked. According to this Article, considerations of economic, commercial and industrial interests by
Member States shall not affect the application of the eight criteria regulating arms exports.
Parliament recalled that the defence industry should serve as an instrument for implementing the defence and security of the Member States
ensuring a security of supply regime in the EU, while also contributing towards the implementation of a strengthened Common Foreign and
Security Policy and Common Security and Defence Policy. It recognised that arms exports have been instrumental in terms of strengthening
and further developing the industrial and technological base of European defence, which has been important in a wide range of innovation and
technological development. It also acknowledged the legitimacy of exports that are carried out in response to a request made to the EU in
accordance with the right to self-defence. Members stressed the risks that arms from third countries which have high levels of corruption might
be introduced into Europe owing to increased arms smuggling and trafficking. They stressed that arms export controls are an integral part of
EU foreign and security policy and must be guided by the principles enshrined in Article 21 TEU, notably the promotion of democracy and the
rule of law and the preservation of peace, prevention of conflicts and strengthening of international security.
The Arms Trade Treaty (ATT): Parliament welcomed the entry into force of the ATT which, while representing a positive achievement, still has
limitations and ambiguities (unclear concepts, exception to reporting obligations, lack of sanctioning regime). It urged those Member States
that have not yet ratified the ATT to do so at the earliest opportunity.
According to Members, the Treaty will be genuinely successful only if steps are taken to make it universally applicable and if binding or
punitive mechanisms are established, to be used in case of failure to apply the rules/
The Common Position: Parliament recalled that the Common Position should lead to a coordinated approach to the arms trade that does not
affect the right of Member States to operate more restrictive national policies. It pointed out that harmonisation at European level should not be
used as a pretext for watering down stricter national rules. Member States are urged to cancel already agreed contracts where as a result of a
sharply changed situation the deal breaches the Common Position.
Furthermore, Members took the view that the real problem is that the Common Position is being applied loosely and interpreted inconsistently
by the Member States, and therefore they considered it crucial that a consistent and ambitious application of the eight criteria be pursued. The
resolution also:
considered it advisable to make arrangements for conducting independent checks and for penalties in case of infringement of the
Common Position;
encouraged a stricter application of national criteria by broadening assessments to include a focus on the situation in the country of
destination as well as on the specific military technology in question;
called for clarification of Criterion Two which requires Member States to deny an export licence only if there is a clear risk that the
military technology or equipment to be exported might be used for internal repression.

Members States were asked to:
treat the concept of risk in arms transfer licensing processes on a precautionary basis, as is standard when addressing other areas
such as terrorism, money laundering and environmental concerns;
include a mechanism in the Common Position that would automatically freeze existing export licences for arms to countries against
which a European weapons embargo has been established after the export control license was granted;
include arms transporting and arms financing services into their arms brokering legislation;
establish an effective control system regarding possible diversions of exports.
Parliament called for increased coordination at working level within the Council and the EEAS in order to ensure that aspects related to conflict
prevention, development and human rights are duly taken into account.
Transparency: regretting the late adoption of the Sixteenth Annual Report, making it the most delayed ever, Parliament urged the Council and
the VP/HR to look at ways of improving compliance with the reporting obligation and increasing the transparency and public scrutiny of the
export control framework, in particular ensuring that Member States report all arms exports.
Members called for the:
the introduction of a standardised reporting and submission procedure, including a deadline, for information on actual exports and
licence data, to be applied and complied with uniformly in all Member States;
enhanced consultations between Member States with regard to transfers to fragile and unstable regions or countries, in particular
those that are acting aggressively in their neighbourhood;
deep and systematic verification of implementation of the EU sanctions regime against Russia in arms exports and sales of dual-use
technologies;
establishment of a list of persons (including entities and individuals) that have been convicted of violating arms export-related
legislation and of cases of identified diversion;
monitoring of and cooperation on illegal arms trafficking, through cooperation procedures involving police forces and border authorities
based on the exchange of information and databases;
parliamentary oversight to be strengthened at both national and European level by means of annual reports to parliaments.
New technologies and the issue of dual-use goods: given that technological developments make it increasingly difficult to distinguish between
pure military and pure civilian use, Members called for special attention to be paid to the Dual Use List in the light of the Wassenaar
Arrangement. Particular attention should be given to new technologies of strategic importance, such as Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems,
applied robotics and surveillance technology.
Member States were asked to make sufficient resources available to effectively implement and enforce dual-use export, brokering and transit
controls.
