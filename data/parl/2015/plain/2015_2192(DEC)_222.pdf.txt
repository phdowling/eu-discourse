the 2014 discharge procedure.
Analysis of the accounts of the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC).
CONTENT: this Commission document sets out the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2014 as

the Financial Regulation applicable to the EU's General Budget, including the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications
(BEREC).
The document contains the figures on which the discharge procedure is based.
On this basis, the Financial Controller of the European Commission ensures the certification of the consolidated accounts as declared by the

Discharge procedure of the EU agencies: the EU Budget finances a wide range of policies and programmes throughout the EU. In accordance
with the priorities set by the European Parliament and the Council in the multi-annual financial framework (MFF), the European Commission
carries out specific programmes, activities and projects in the field with the technical support of some specialised agencies.
The consolidated annual accounts of the EU provide information on the activities of the institutions, agencies and other bodies of the EU from
a budgetary and accrual accounting perspective.
The consolidated reports on the implementation of the general budget of the EU include the budget implementation of all Institutions. Agencies
do not have a separate budget inside the EU budget; and they are partially financed by a Commission budget subsidy.
This document sets out how the Agencies spent and implemented their budget in 2014. Each agency is subject to its own discharge
procedure.

BEREC: in 2014, the tasks and budget of this agency were as follows:

Parliament and of the Council with a view to developing the single market for electronic communication networks and services, as well
as to improving its operation by ensuring the consistent application of the European Unions regulatory framework for electronic
communications;
BEREC's budget for the 2014 financial year: BERECs budget for 2014, as presented in the Commission document on the
consolidated annual accounts of the European Union, gives the following figures:
Commitment appropriations :
- committed : EUR 4 million;
- paid : EUR 4 million;
- carried-over : 0.
Payment appropriations :
- committed : EUR 5 million;
- paid : EUR 4 million;
- carried-over : 1 million.

of its Financial Regulation and the accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
Opinion on the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the transactions underlying the annual
accounts for the year ended 31 December 2014 are legal and regular in all material respects.
The report also makes a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of the Office, accompanied by the latters
response. The main observations may be summarised as follows
The Courts observations:
budgetary management: the overall level of committed appropriations improved to 98 %. However, the level of committed
appropriations carried over increased, particularly in relation to operational activities such as ongoing studies on electronic
communications.
The Offices reply:
budgetary management: the BEREC Office took note of the budgetary management comment on committed appropriations. It stated
that the 2014 budget was drafted in 2012 where the BEREC Office was in its early phase of the budget management. Since then,
tools are being used to improve the regular monitoring that has led to a better planning.
The BEREC Office has set as target to reduce the level of committed appropriations carried over in 2015.
Lastly, the Court of Auditors report contains a summary of the Offices activities in 2014. This is focused on the following:
Budget: EUR 4 162 874.
Activities:

2015/2192(DEC) - 27/01/2016 Supplementary non-legislative basic document
Having examined the revenue and expenditure accounts for the financial year 2014 and the balance sheet as at 31 December 2014 of the
Office of the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC), as well as the Court of Auditors' report on the annual
accounts of the Office for the financial year 2014, accompanied by the Office's replies to the Court's observations, the Council recommended
the European Parliament to give a discharge to the Management Committee of the Office in respect of the implementation of the budget for the
financial year 2014.
The Council welcomed the Court's opinion that, in all material respects, the Office's annual accounts present fairly its financial position as at 31
December 2014 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions of the Office's
Financial Regulation, and that the underlying transactions for 2014 are legal and regular in all material respects.
Nevertheless, the Council has made some observations which may be summarised as follows:
financial programming: the Council called on the Office to continue improving its financial programming and monitoring of the budget
implementation, in order to reduce the number of budgetary transfers and the level of commitments carried over to the next financial
year to the strict minimum, in line with the budgetary principle of annuality;
external contributions to the budget: the Council welcomed the Office's adjustment of its 2015 budget to take into account the absence
of agreements with EFTA countries and invited the Office to remain prudent when forecasting the related contributions from national
regulatory authorities of EFTA member states.

2015/2192(DEC) - 07/04/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Derek VAUGHAN (S&D, UK) on discharge in respect of the implementation of the
budget of the Office of the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications for the financial year 2014.
The parliamentary committee calls on the European Parliament to grant the Management Committee of the Office of the Body of European
Regulators for Electronic Communications discharge in respect of the implementation of the Bodys budget for the financial year 2014.
Noting that the Court of Auditors issued a statement of assurance as to the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the
underlying transactions for the financial year 2014, Members call on Parliament to approve the closure of the Agencys accounts. They made,
however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is granted, in addition to the general
recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies:
·

Offices financial statements: Members note the final budget of the Office of the Body of European Regulators for Electronic
Communications (the Office) for the financial year 2014 was EUR 4 162 874, representing an increase of 17 % compared to 2013.
That increase resulted mainly from the inclusion of the internal assigned revenue from previous years.

·

Budget and financial management: Members note with satisfaction that budget monitoring efforts during the financial year 2014
resulted in a budget implementation rate of 97.91 %, representing an increase of 8.36 % compared to the year 2012. They note
furthermore that the payment appropriations execution rate was at 75.66 %, representing a decrease of 0.92 % compared to 2013.

Members also made a series of observations regarding commitments and carryovers, the prevention and management of conflicts of interest,
recruitment and contract award procedures, and internal audit procedures.
Lastly, Members take note that the 2014 budget provisions for contributions from the European Free Trade Associations (EFTA) national
regulatory authorities having observer status at BEREC did not materialise in the absence of agreements with EFTA countries . They
acknowledge that the 2015 budget of the Office was corrected accordingly. They invite the Office to remain prudent when forecasting the
related contribution from national regulatory authorities of EFTA countries.
