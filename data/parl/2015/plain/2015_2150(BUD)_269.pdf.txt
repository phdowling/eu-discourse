2015/2150(BUD) - 15/07/2015 Commission draft budget
PURPOSE: presentation of a Draft Amending Budget (DAB) No 6 to the General Budget of the European Union for the year 2015.
CONTENT: Draft Amending Budget (DAB) No 6 for the year 2015 covers the following:
a revision of the forecast of Traditional Own Resources (TOR, i.e. customs duties and sugar sector levies), VAT and GNI bases, the
budgeting of the relevant UK corrections as well as their financing resulting in a change in the distribution between Member States of
their own resources contributions to the EU budget;
the creation of two new budget items 21 01 04 08 and 22 01 04 03 Support expenditure for trust funds managed by the European
Commission. These items are intended to receive compensation for management costs related to the European Union trust funds for
external action, in accordance with Article 187(7) of the Financial Regulation;
an amendment of the establishment plan of the BEREC Office, without incurring any changes to the overall budget or the total number
of posts. To recall, the BEREC Office was established in 2009 and is located in Riga (Latvia). Currently, it has a staff of 15 temporary
agents. The proposed amendment of the 2015 establishment plan of the BEREC Office is necessary in order to allow for the
reclassification (promotion) of two administrators (AD 5) and two assistants (AST 3) temporary posts in 2015. The overall budget and
the total number of posts will remain unchanged.
In summary, DAB 6/2015 has no consequences for expenditure in 2015 . The impact for revenue is a change in the distribution between
Member States of their own resources contributions.

2015/2150(BUD) - 18/09/2015 Council position on draft budget
On 15 July 2015, the Commission submitted to the Council draft amending budget (DAB) No 6 to the general budget for 2015, covering the
following elements:
a revision of the forecast of Own Resources and of the UK correction,
the creation of two new budget items 21 01 04 08 and 22 01 04 03 (Support expenditure for trust funds managed by the European
Commission) in the policy areas Development and Cooperation, and Enlargement, with a p.m. token entry,
the budgetary neutral amendment of the establishment plan of the BEREC Office.
The revised forecast of Own Resources was agreed on 19 May 2015 and concerns customs duties, VAT and GNI bases.
The forecasts for net customs duties and the GNI base were revised upwards (+6.79 % and +0.42 % respectively), and the forecast of the VAT
base was revised downwards (-1.26 %).
The correction of budgetary imbalances in favour of the United Kingdom (UK correction) concerns the years 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014. This

correction is financed by the other Member States, excluding the UK.
Council position: on 18 September 2015, the Council adopted its position on DAB No 6/2015 as set out in the technical annex to the
explanatory memorandum to its position (see annex Council doc 11695/15).

An amending budget without any implications on the 2015 budget: Members noted that Draft amending budget No 6/2015, in all its elements,
has no impact on the expenditure side of the 2015 budget and that its impact on the revenue side is a change in the distribution between

Therefore, they called on the European Parliament to approve the Council position on Draft amending budget No 6/2015.
