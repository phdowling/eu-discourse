Commission response to text adopted in plenary

SP(2015)233

03/07/2015

2015/2530(RSP) - 11/02/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 532 votes to 136, with 36 abstentions, a resolution on anti-terrorism measures.
The text adopted in plenary was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ECR, ALDE, and EFDD groups.
Parliament condemned in the strongest terms the atrocities in Paris as well as all terrorist attacks, stresses that there is no freedom without
security and no security without freedom. Members noted with concern the rapidly rising number of EU nationals who travel to conflict areas to
join terrorist organisations and later return to EU territory, presenting risks to the Unions internal security.
They called for:
a clear and common definition of EU foreign fighters in order to increase legal certainty;
more specialised measures to tackle the problem of EU citizens travelling to fight for terrorist organisations abroad and to prevent
radicalisation.
Combating the root causes of terrorism and radicalisation leading to violent extremism: Members stressed that addressing the threat posed by
terrorism in general requires an anti-terrorism strategy based on a multi-layer approach, which comprehensively addresses the underlying
factors of radicalisation leading to violent extremism, such as developing social cohesion, inclusiveness and political and religious tolerance,
and avoiding ghettoization, , preventing departures to join terrorist organisations, disrupting financial support to terrorist organisations, etc.
They called on the Member States to invest in schemes which address the root causes of radicalisation, including educational programmes.
As regards the phenomenon of radicalisation in prisons, Members called for special attention to be given to detention conditions and to do
more to improve prisons administrative systems so as to facilitate detection of detainees who are involved in the preparation of terrorist acts.
Measures to foster deradicalisation are necessary by empowering and engaging with communities and civil society at national and local level
to stop the spread of extremist ideologies.
Parliament supported the adoption of a European strategy for countering terrorist propaganda, radical networks and online recruitment,
building upon the efforts already made and the initiatives already taken on an intergovernmental and voluntary basis. It called for the adoption
of a Council recommendation on national strategies for the prevention of radicalisation leading to violence.
Implementation and review of existing law enforcement measures: Parliament committed itself to work towards the finalisation of an EU PNR
Directive by the end of 2015. It encouraged the Council to make progress on the Data Protection package so that trilogues on both EU PNR
Directive and Data Protection Package could take place in parallel. It also encouraged the Commission to undertake a corresponding
assessment of the remaining gaps in the fight against terrorism, where the European Council shall regularly assess the threats facing the
Union in order to enable the Union and its Member States to take effective action. It called in particular for the Commission and the Council to
endorse a renewed roadmap to combat terrorism, which delivers an efficient response to existing threats and ensures effective security for all
while guaranteeing the rights and freedoms which are the founding principles of the European Union.
Further measures are called for, such as:
supporting victims and their families;
combating trafficking in firearms;
stepping up judicial cooperation between the Member States.
EU internal security and EU law enforcement and Agency capabilities: Members called on all Member States to prevent the movement of
terrorist suspects by strengthening external border controls, checking travel documents more systematically and effectively, tackling illicit arms
trafficking and fraudulent use of identity, and identifying risk areas. Members called for specific measures on internet and social media
surveillance. Parliament reiterated that all data collection and sharing, including by EU agencies such as Europol, should be compliant with EU
and national law and based on a coherent data protection framework. It stressed the need to improve, intensify and accelerate global law
enforcement information sharing at an international level. A comprehensive evaluation of the EUs counter-terrorism and related measures, in
particular as regards the implementation thereof in law and in practice in the Member States is needed.
The resolution underlined the need for European agencies and national law enforcement authorities to combat the main sources of revenue for
terrorist organisations, including money laundering, human trafficking, and the illicit arms trade. It called, in this respect, for the full
implementation of EU legislation in this area given that only 50% of information regarding terrorism and organised crime is given by Member
States to Europol and Eurojust.
Adopting an EU external strategy to combat international terrorism: Parliament called on the EU to actively promote a global partnership
against terrorism and to work closely with regional actors such as the African Union, the Gulf Cooperation Council and the Arab League, and in
particular with the countries which are neighbours of Syria and Iraq and countries who have been dramatically impacted by the conflict, such
as Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. The European External Action Service (EEAS) is called upon to develop a counter-terrorism cooperation
strategy with third countries.
Parliament urged the EU to revise its strategy towards the southern Mediterranean as part of the ongoing European Neighbourhood Policy
review, and to focus on the participation of the civil society.
Lastly, Parliament stressed that a comprehensive EU strategy on anti-terrorism measures must also make full use of its foreign and
development policies in order to combat poverty, discrimination and marginalisation to prevent certain groups from being more vulnerable to
extremist group propaganda.
