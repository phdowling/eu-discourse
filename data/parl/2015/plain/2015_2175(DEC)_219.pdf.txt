2015/2175(DEC) - 23/07/2015 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: presentation by the Commission of the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2014, as part of
the 2014 discharge procedure.
Analysis of the accounts of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).
CONTENT: this Commission document sets out the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2014 as
prepared on the basis of the information presented by the institutions, organisations and bodies of the EU, in accordance with Article 148 (2) of
the Financial Regulation applicable to the EU's General Budget, including the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).
The document contains the figures on which the discharge procedure is based.
On this basis, the Financial Controller of the European Commission ensures the certification of the consolidated accounts as declared by the
institutions, agencies and bodies of the European Union.
Discharge procedure of the EU agencies: the EU Budget finances a wide range of policies and programmes throughout the EU. In accordance
with the priorities set by the European Parliament and the Council in the multi-annual financial framework (MFF), the European Commission
carries out specific programmes, activities and projects in the field with the technical support of some specialised agencies.
The consolidated annual accounts of the EU provide information on the activities of the institutions, agencies and other bodies of the EU from
a budgetary and accrual accounting perspective.
The consolidated reports on the implementation of the general budget of the EU include the budget implementation of all Institutions. Agencies
do not have a separate budget inside the EU budget; and they are partially financed by a Commission budget subsidy.

This document sets out how the Agencies spent and implemented their budget in 2014. Each agency is subject to its own discharge
procedure.
EASA: in 2014, the tasks and budget of this agency were as follows:
description of EASA's tasks: EASA, which is located in Cologne, was established by Regulation (EC) No 1592/2002 of the European
Parliament and of the Council and its role is to maintain a high uniform level of civil aviation safety in Europe and to ensure the proper
development of civil aviation safety. It shall issue opinions and recommendations to the Commission and take decisions in this area;
EASA's budget for the 2014 financial year: the Agencys budget for 2014, as presented in the Commission document on the
consolidated annual accounts of the European Union, gives the following figures:
Commitment appropriations :
- committed : EUR 184 million;
- paid : EUR 136 million;
- carried-over : EUR 45 million.
Payment appropriations :
- committed : EUR 191 million;
- paid : EUR 125 million;
- carried-over : EUR 63 million.
Please refer also to the final accounts of the EASA.

2015/2175(DEC) - 15/09/2015 Court of Auditors: opinion, report
PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the European Aviation Safety Agency for the year 2014,
together with the Agencys reply.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit concerned, amongst others, the annual accounts of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).
Statement of assurance: pursuant to the provisions of Article 287 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the Court
has audited:
the annual accounts of the Agency, which comprise the financial statements and the reports on the implementation of the budget for
the financial year ended 31 December 2014, and
the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying those accounts.
Opinion on the reliability of the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the Agencys annual accounts present fairly, in all material respects, its
financial position as at 31 December 2014 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the
provisions of its Financial Regulation and the accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
Opinion on the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the transactions underlying the annual
accounts for the year ended 31 December 2014 are legal and regular in all material respects.
The report also makes a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of the Agency, accompanied by the latters
response. The main observations may be summarised as follows:
The Courts observations:
budgetary management: although the Agency reduced further the overall level of carry-overs, this amount remained high at EUR 3.6
million (22 %) for administrative expenditure and at EUR 2 million (38.1 %) for operational expenditure, which is at odds with the
budgetary principle of annuality;
public procurement: the Court noted that there is room to improve the Agencys procurement planning, particularly in respect of
framework contracts. In 2014, three procedures were launched too late to replace existing framework contracts by the time they
expired.
The Agencys replies:
budgetary management: the Agency has continued to reduce the overall level of carry-overs. The 2014 exercise has been affected by
exceptional events linked to the Agencys move to a new headquarter building (MOVE project);
public procurement: the Agency hopes to deliver a better organisational oversight on procurement in the future.
Lastly, the Court of Auditors report contains a summary of the Agencys activities in 2014. This is focused on the following:
Budget: EUR 162.3 million of which the Union subsidy amounts to 21.1 %.
Activities:
opinions and decisions relating to certification and compliance;
notices of proposed amendments;
international cooperation including a cooperation agreement with bilateral partners of the Agency;

bilateral aviation safety agreements (BASA) with Brazil or the United States and Canada;
certification decisions ;
standardisation inspections in the field of airworthiness, operations, flight crew licensing, medical flight crew licensing and flight
simulation training devices.

2015/2175(DEC) - 27/01/2016 Supplementary non-legislative basic document
Having examined the revenue and expenditure accounts for the financial year 2014 and the balance sheet as at 31 December 2014 of the
European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), as well as the Court of Auditors' report on the annual accounts of the Agency for the financial year
2014, accompanied by the Agency's replies to the Court's observations, the Council recommended the European Parliament to give a
discharge to the Executive Director of the Agency in respect of the implementation of the budget for the financial year 2014.
The Council welcomed the Court's opinion that, in all material respects, the Agency's annual accounts present fairly its financial position as at
31 December 2014 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions of the
Agency's Financial Regulation, and that the underlying transactions for 2014 are legal and regular in all material respects.
Nevertheless, the Council has made some observations which may be summarised as follows:
public procurement: once again, the Council regretted the deficiencies found by the Court in the Agency's procurement procedures
and urges the Agency to take appropriate action in order to improve its procurement planning;
carry-overs: the Council, while welcoming the steps taken by the Agency to implement the Court's previous recommendations, noted
that the level of commitment appropriations carried over remained high. The Council reiterates its request to the Agency to continue
improving its financial programming and monitoring of the budget implementation with a view to reducing the level of carry-overs to the
next financial year to the strict minimum, in line with the budgetary principle of annuality.

2015/2175(DEC) - 07/04/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Derek VAUGHAN (S&D, UK) on discharge in respect of the implementation of the
budget of the European Aviation Safety Agency for the financial year 2014.
The parliamentary committee calls on the European Parliament to grant the Executive Director of the Agency discharge in respect of the
implementation of the agencys budget for the financial year 2014.
Noting that the Court of Auditors issued a statement of assurance as to the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the
underlying transactions for the financial year 2014, Members call on Parliament to approve the closure of the Agencys accounts. They made,
however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is granted, in addition to the general
recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies:
·

Agencys financial statements: Members note the final budget of the Agency for the financial year 2014 was EUR 181 179 098,
representing an increase of 8.47 % compared to 2013.

·

Budget and financial management: Members note that the budget monitoring efforts during the financial year 2014 resulted in a
budget implementation rate of 97.1 %, representing a decrease of 0.9 % compared to 2013.

Members also made a series of observations regarding procedures for contract awards (which need to be better planned), recruitment, internal
control and audit, as well as the prevention and management of conflicts of interest. In this regard, Members note that, in 2014, the Agency
adopted a Confidential Safety Reporting Procedure which addresses whistle-blower information related to alleged malpractices and
irregularities in the field of aviation safety reported by external individuals. They observe that there were 66 cases related to this procedure in
2014 and note that the Agency has a whistle-blower procedure in place and that one case was registered in 2014 with no appeals received.
In parallel, Members note that the Agency already established and implemented a comprehensive policy on the prevention and mitigation of
conflicts of interest as well as on Gifts and Hospitality in its Code of Conduct (CC) for the staff. This policy includes inter alia the establishment
of an Ethical Committee to assess the completed declarations of interest and to deal with any subject related to the CC. They note that the
Agency is set to review and update its policies on management of conflicts of interest and call on the Agency to report to the discharge
authority on the status of the policy update.
They note with concern that, since 2004, when the Agency became operational, it has been working merely on the basis of correspondence
and exchanges with the host Member State. They note, furthermore, that a comprehensive headquarters agreement has not yet been signed
with the host Member State. They acknowledge that the government of the host Member State recently initiated informal discussions with the
Agency on this matter. They call on the Agency and the host Member State to address this issue as a matter of the utmost urgency.
Lastly, Members highlight the Agency's vital role in ensuring the highest possible level of aviation safety throughout Europe; recognises that,
due to the disappearance of MH370, the dramatic accident of MH17, the crash of Air Asia QZ8501 and the radar interferences over Central
Europe.
2014 was a challenging year for the Agency and for aviation safety in general, requiring it to deal with implementing and supervising new
provisions on flight time limitations. Members call for the necessary financial, material and human resources to be made available to allow the
Agency to perform its regulatory and executive tasks successfully, in the fields of safety and environmental protection, without compromising
its independence and impartiality.

2015/2175(DEC) - 28/04/2016 Final act
PURPOSE: to grant discharge to the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) in respect of the Agencys budget for the financial year 2014.

NON LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision (EU) 2016/1501 of the European Parliament on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of
the European Aviation Safety Agency for the financial year 2014.
CONTENT: with the present decision, the European Parliament grants discharge to the Executive Director of the European Aviation Safety
Agency for the implementation of its budget for the financial year 2014.
This decision is in line with the European Parliament's resolution adopted on 28 April 2016 and comprises a series of observations that form
an integral part of the discharge decision (please refer to the summary of the opinion of 28 April 2016).
Amongst Parliaments main observations in the resolution accompanying the discharge decision, the latter noted with concern that, since 2004,
when the Agency became operational, it has been working merely on the basis of correspondence and exchanges with the host Member
State. It called on the Agency and the host Member State to address this issue as a matter of the utmost urgency and to inform the discharge
authority of the progress of the negotiations.
It reiterated the Agency's vital role in ensuring the highest possible level of aviation safety throughout Europe (notably following the
disappearance of MH370, the dramatic accident of MH17, the crash of Air Asia QZ8501 and the radar interferences over Central Europe).

2015/2175(DEC) - 28/04/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament decided to grant discharge to the Executive Director of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) in respect of
the implementation of the agencys budget for the financial year 2014. The vote on the decision on discharge covers the closure of the
accounts (in accordance with Annex V, Article 5 (1)(a) to Parliaments Rules of Procedure.
Noting that the Court of Auditors has stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the Agencys annual accounts for the financial year
2014 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Parliament adopted by 521 votes to 111 with 8 abstentions, a
resolution containing a series of recommendations, which form an integral part of the decision on discharge and which add to the general
recommendations set out in the resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies:

discussions with the Agency on this matter. It called on the Agency and the host Member State to address this issue as a matter of the utmost

Performance: Parliament noted that, in 2014, the Agency has initiated fundamental changes in the way it operates in order to allow for a more
proportionate and performance-based approach to safety and that it has reviewed its organisational structure to prepare itself for the many
challenges it will face in the immediate coming years.
Lastly, Parliament highlighted the Agency's vital role in ensuring the highest possible level of aviation safety throughout Europe; recognises
that, due to the disappearance of MH370, the dramatic accident of MH17, the crash of Air Asia QZ8501 and the radar interferences over
