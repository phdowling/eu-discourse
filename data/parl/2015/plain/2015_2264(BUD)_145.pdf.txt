2015/2264(BUD) - 14/10/2015 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: to mobilise the Flexibility Instrument for immediate budgetary measures under the European Agenda on Migration.
PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
CONTENT: Council Regulation (EU, EURATOM) No 1311/2013 of 2 December 2013 laying down the multiannual financial framework for the
years 2014-2020 allows for the mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument to allow the financing of clearly identified expenditure which could not
be financed within the limits of the ceilings available for one or more headings of the multiannual financial framework.
Having examined all possibilities for re-allocating appropriations and exhausted any unallocated margin under the expenditure heading
Security and Citizenship (heading 3), it appears necessary to mobilise EUR 1 504 million beyond the ceiling of heading 3 of the multiannual
financial framework through the Flexibility Instrument to finance measures in the field of migration. This includes an amount of EUR 123 966
698 for which the Commission had made a proposal to mobilise the Flexibility Instrument for the same purpose which accompanied the initial
draft budget 2016, and which is now repealed and replaced by the present proposal.
In accordance with Article 11(2) of Council Regulation N° 1311/2013, the amount proposed to be mobilised for budget year 2016 uses annual
amounts not used of previous years of the Flexibility Instrument (2014 and 2015).
The payment appropriations corresponding to the mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument will be as follows:
EUR 710 million in 2016;
EUR 652.9 million in 2017;
EUR 82.7 million in 2018;
EUR 58.5 million in 2019.

2015/2264(BUD) - 19/11/2015 Budgetary report tabled for plenary, 1st reading

The Committee on Budgets adopted the report by José Manuel FERNANDES (EPP, PT) on the proposal for a decision of the European
Parliament and of the Council on mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument for immediate budgetary measures to address the refugee crisis, in
accordance with point 12 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 2 December 2013 between the European Parliament, the Council and the
Commission on budgetary discipline, on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management.
Members stated that after having examined all possibilities for re-allocating commitment appropriations under heading 3 and heading 4, it
appears necessary to mobilise the Flexibility Instrument for commitment appropriations to complement the financing in the general budget of
the Union for the financial year 2016 beyond the ceiling of heading 3 by EUR 1 504 million in commitment appropriations to finance measures
under the European Agenda on Migration.
In addition to a final amount of EUR 1 506 million beyond the ceiling of heading 3, the Conciliation Committee convened for the 2016 budget
agreed to Parliament's delegation proposal for a further mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument by EUR 24 million beyond the ceiling of
heading 4 in order to address the external dimension of the challenges posed by the refugee crisis.
Therefore, the total amount of the Flexibility Instrument for the financial year 2016, which includes the unused amounts from the financial years
2014 and 2015, is therefore fully exhausted.
Members called on the European Parliament to approve the mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument for an amount of EUR 1 530 million in
commitment appropriations.
The proposed allocation of the corresponding payment appropriations is as follows:
EUR 734.2 million in 2016,
EUR 654.2 million in 2017,
EUR 83 million in 2018,
EUR 58.6 million in 2019.
Further budget flexibility: Members reiterated that the mobilisation of this instrument shows, once more, the crucial need for the Union budget
to be more flexible. Members noted that these additional appropriations are only made possible thanks to the carry-over of unused amounts
from the Flexibility Instruments of the financial years 2014 and 2015 and that no amount will be carried over to the financial year 2017, thus
limiting any mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument to its annual ceiling of EUR 471 million.
Consequently, Members called on the Parliament to approve the decision annexed to the draft resolution.

2015/2264(BUD) - 25/11/2015 Budgetary text adopted by Parliament
The European Parliament adopted by 576 votes to 72, with 50 abstentions, a resolution on the proposal for a decision of the European
Parliament and of the Council on mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument for immediate budgetary measures to address the refugee crisis, in
accordance with point 12 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 2 December 2013 between the European Parliament, the Council and the
Commission on budgetary discipline, on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management.
Parliament stated that after having examined all possibilities for re-allocating commitment appropriations under heading 3 and heading 4, it
appears necessary to mobilise the Flexibility Instrument for commitment appropriations.
The Commission proposed to mobilise the Flexibility Instrument in order to complement the financing in the general budget of the Union for the
financial year 2016 beyond the ceiling of heading 3 by EUR 1 504 million in commitment appropriations to finance measures under the
European Agenda on Migration.
In addition to a final amount of EUR 1 506 million beyond the ceiling of heading 3, the Conciliation Committee convened for the 2016 budget
agreed to Parliament's delegation proposal for a further mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument by EUR 24 million beyond the ceiling of
heading 4 in order to address the external dimension of the challenges posed by the refugee crisis.
Therefore, the total amount of the Flexibility Instrument for the financial year 2016, which includes the unused amounts from the financial years
2014 and 2015, is therefore fully exhausted.
The European Parliament approved the mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument for an amount of EUR 1 530 million in commitment
appropriations.
On the basis of the expected payment profile, the payment appropriations corresponding to the mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument will be
as follows:
EUR 734.2 million in 2016,
EUR 654.2 million in 2017,
EUR 83 million in 2018,
EUR 58.6 million in 2019.

Consequently, Parliament approved the decision annexed to the draft resolution and to mobilise the Flexbility Instrument as set out above.

2015/2264(BUD) - 25/11/2015 Final act
PURPOSE: to mobilise the Flexibility Instrument for immediate budgetary measures under the European Agenda on Migration.

NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision (EU) 2016/253 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the mobilisation of the Flexibility
Instrument for immediate budgetary measures to address the refugee crisis.
CONTENT: Council Regulation (EU, EURATOM) No 1311/2013 of 2 December 2013 laying down the multiannual financial framework for the
years 2014-2020 allows for the mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument to allow the financing of clearly identified expenditure which could not
be financed within the limits of the ceilings available for one or more headings of the multiannual financial framework.
Due to the urgent needs, it is necessary to mobilise an important additional amount to finance measures to alleviate the migration and refugee
crisis.
After having examined all possibilities for re-allocating appropriations under the expenditure ceilings for heading 3 (Security and Citizenship)
and heading 4 (Global Europe), it appears necessary to mobilise the Flexibility Instrument to complement the financing in the general budget
of the European Union for the financial year 2016, beyond the ceilings of heading 3 by EUR 1 506 million and heading 4 by EUR 24 million to
finance measures in the field of migration and refugees. The unused annual amounts available for the Flexibility Instruments of the financial
years 2014 and 2015 should be used for this mobilisation.
On the basis of the expected payment profile, the payment appropriations corresponding to the mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument should
be distributed over several financial years and are estimated to:
EUR 734.2 million in 2016,
EUR 654.2 million in 2017,
EUR 83 million in 2018,
EUR 58.6 million in 2019.
The specific amounts for each financial year shall be authorised in accordance with the annual budgetary procedure.
