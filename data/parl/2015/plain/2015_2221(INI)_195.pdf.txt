2015/2221(INI) - 23/02/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs adopted the own-initiative report by Roberto GUALTIERI (S&D, IT) on the Banking Union
Annual Report 2015.
Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM)
Members welcomed the establishment of the SSM, which has been successful since its creation both from an operational point of view and in
terms of supervisory quality.
In particular, in relation to the operational set-up, they welcomed:
·

the recruitment process, which resulted in a good blend of competences, cultures and gender, even if ECB contracting practices
leave room for improvement;

·

the drafting, building on national best practices, of the Supervisory Manual laying down common processes, procedures and
methods for conducting a euro-wide supervisory review process;

·

the set-up of the IT infrastructure and of the supporting analytical tools;

·

the setting up of Joint Supervisory Teams (JSTs) and the dialogue they have established with the supervised credit institutions.

Members noted that a very significant share of work is routinely devoted to administrative procedures, required by the SSM Regulation, which
may not always be proportionate. They stood ready to consider proposals to reduce the operational burden on structures at all levels and to
improve the effectiveness of the SSM supervision.
They also emphasised the need to avoid unnecessary administrative burden on credit institutions, in particular smaller banks, and to ensure
that the proportionality principle is upheld.
Members also called for a systematic review of comprehensive assessments of ECB-supervised institutions, as well as for appropriate
improvements of the methodology in the light of lessons learned. They emphasised the limitations of the current stress test methodology which
evaluates third-country exposure on the basis of banks internal assessment.
Members noted that:
·

banking structural reform, which was conceived to reduce systemic risk and address the issue of too big to fail institutions, has yet to

be implemented and urged a swift legislative agreement;
·

the insurance sector is becoming increasingly involved in financial services, and underlined the importance of a level playing field in
order to avoid regulatory arbitrage of prudential and consumer protection rules;

·

an increase in capital requirements beyond a certain threshold may in the short term create unintended consequences, limiting banks
lending capacity (i.e. this risk should therefore be considered when determining the level of capital).

Members considered that more appropriate attention should be paid to increased exposure in the form of off-balance sheet items, in particular
for global systematically important banks (G-SIBs). They underlined the need to be vigilant over the development of the shadow banking
sector.
As regards sovereign exposures of banks and other financial intermediaries, the report calls on the EU institutions to carefully and thoroughly
assess possible changes in the medium term to the current regulatory framework, without reducing available funding for Member States,
without creating unintended market or competition distortions and without affecting financial stability, and as part of a coordinated effort at the
global level. Parallel measures should be taken among others to reduce level 2 and level 3 assets exposure and to ensure the full
convergence of internal ratings-based systems for the measurement of credit risk.
The Commission is called upon to:
·

put forward a proposal for a technical adaptation of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions
and investment firms and the Capital Requirements Directive (Directive 2013/36/EU) in order to align them with the Banking Union
framework.

·

use regulations (which are applicable directly and to all throughout the EU), rather than directives, as the legislative tool to ensure
harmonised implementation across the EU and the Banking Union.

Members stressed that the European Banking Authority, with its explicit consumer protection mandate, must enforce and enhance the
consumer protection framework for banking services, complementing the SSMs prudential supervision, and in the Union as a whole.
Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM)
Members welcomed the efficient setting-up of the Single Resolution Board (SRB) and the establishment of national resolution authorities
(NRAs) in the Member States.
The committee highlighted the importance of establishing efficient cooperation between the SRB and the NRAs for the smooth functioning of
the SRM.
The report:
·

encouraged the conclusion of a memorandum of understanding on mutual cooperation and data sharing between the SRB and the
ECB as a single supervisor;

·

called for specific arrangements to be created within the Commission and between the SRB and the Commission in order to define
efficient procedures for decision-making in the event of resolution;

·

encourages the conclusion of cooperation agreements between the SRB and the NRAs of non-participating Member States and third
countries for effective mutual cooperation and information exchange:

·

called on the Commission to swiftly adopt the regulatory technical standard on MREL, with a high binding standard of at least 8 %
MREL for all SRB banks, in line with the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) (Directive 2014/59/EU);

·

underlined that the Board should take due care to establish the resolution plans of systemically important institutions, assess their
resolvability and take all action necessary to address or remove all of the impediments to their resolvability.

The report also stressed the need, as a consequence of the existence of the national compartments in the SRF, to rapidly put in place an
adequate bridge financing mechanism in order to provide the fund, if necessary, with sufficient resources in the period before its completion
and guarantee the effective separation between banks and sovereigns.
Lastly, Members regretted the decision to set up the SRF through an IGA rather than through Union law. They called on the Commission
swiftly to take the necessary steps, as provided for in Article 16 of the Agreement, for a quick integration of the IGA into the framework of EU
law.
Third pillar
Members recalled that, together with the SSM and the SRM, the capacity to afford a uniform and high level of protection of deposits,
irrespective of their location, should be ensured in an effective Banking Union. Any system of protection of deposits must always avoid the
introduction of any moral hazard, while ensuring that risk takers remain liable for their risk taking.
In this context, the report welcomed the Commissions proposed package on risk sharing and risk reduction in the Banking Union of 24
November 2015. It noted that the creation of a European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS) requires the implementation of the single rulebook
as well as of the first and second pillars of the Banking Union, and of the transposition of the BRRD and the Deposit Guarantee Schemes
Directive (Directive 2014/49/EU) by all the participating Member States.

2015/2221(INI) - 10/03/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 351 votes to 112, with 30 abstentions, a resolution on the Banking Union Annual Report 2015.
1) Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM)
Parliament welcomed the establishment of the SSM, which has been successful since its creation both from an operational point of view and in
terms of supervisory quality.

In particular, in relation to the operational set-up, it welcomed:
the recruitment process, which resulted in a good blend of competences, cultures and gender, even if ECB contracting practices leave
room for improvement;
the drafting, building on national best practices, of the Supervisory Manual laying down common processes, procedures and methods
for conducting a euro-wide supervisory review process;
the set-up of the IT infrastructure and of the supporting analytical tools;
the setting up of Joint Supervisory Teams (JSTs) and the dialogue they have established with the supervised credit institutions.
Reducing in the administrative burden: a very significant share of work is routinely devoted to administrative procedures. Members are ready
to examine proposals to reduce the operational burden on structures at all levels and to improve the effectiveness of the SSM supervision.
They also emphasised the need to avoid unnecessary administrative burden on credit institutions, in particular smaller banks, and to ensure
that the proportionality principle is upheld.
The ECB is called upon to ensure that the creation of a comprehensive credit risk database (Analytical Credit Dataset, AnaCredit) pays
particular attention to the proportionality principle and to the need to avoid disproportionately high administrative costs, especially for smaller
institutions.
Bank assessments: Parliament called for a systematic review of comprehensive assessments of ECB-supervised institutions, as well as for
appropriate improvements of the methodology in the light of lessons learned. It emphasised the limitations of the current stress test
methodology which evaluates third-country exposure on the basis of banks internal assessment.
Non-performing loans: Members recalled that the ability to write off or sell-on non-performing loans is vital, as it frees up capital to fund new
loans, in particular to SMEs. They stressed the need to address the issue of non-performing loans at European level, notably by facilitating the
setting-up of asset management companies in those countries where this is deemed to be necessary, as was the case in Spain and Ireland.
The resolution noted that:
banking structural reform, which was conceived to reduce systemic risk and address the issue of too big to fail institutions, has yet to
be implemented and urged a swift legislative agreement;
the insurance sector is becoming increasingly involved in financial services, and underlined the importance of a level playing field in
order to avoid regulatory arbitrage of prudential and consumer protection rules.
Own resources: Parliament stated that the worldwide drive towards more and better quality bank capital and less leveraged banks is a
necessary condition for a sound banking system capable of supporting the economy and for avoiding any repeat of the enormous bailouts
witnessed during the crisis.
It is however stressed that an increase in capital requirements beyond a certain threshold may in the short term create unintended
consequences, limiting banks lending capacity (i.e. this risk should therefore be considered when determining the level of capital).
Members considered that more appropriate attention should be paid to increased exposure in the form of off-balance sheet items, in particular
for global systematically important banks (G-SIBs). They underlined the need to be vigilant over the development of the shadow banking
sector.
Sovereign exposures of banks and other financial intermediaries: Parliament called on the EU institutions to carefully and thoroughly assess
possible changes in the medium term to the current regulatory framework, without reducing available funding for Member States, without
creating unintended market or competition distortions and without affecting financial stability, and as part of a coordinated effort at the global
level. It stressed that in order to have a comprehensive risk reduction, parallel measures should be taken among others to reduce level 2 and
level 3 assets exposure and to ensure the full convergence of internal ratings-based (IRB) systems for the measurement of credit risk.
Single Supervisory approach: Parliament stressed that national options and discretion attributed to Member States prevent the SSM from
developing a single coherent supervisory approach within the euro area in order to ensure a true level playing field. It emphasised the need for
the review of national options and stands ready to cooperate at the legislative level in order to further improve regulatory and supervisory.
Adaptation of the legislation: the Commission is called upon to:
put forward a proposal for a technical adaptation of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and
investment firms and the Capital Requirements Directive (Directive 2013/36/EU) in order to align them with the Banking Union
framework.
