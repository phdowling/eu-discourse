2015/2018(BUD) - 16/12/2014 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: to mobilise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) to assist Germany following redundancies in its solar modular
producing industry.
PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
CONTENT: Article 12 of Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 laying down the multiannual financial framework for the years
2014-2020 provides that the EGF shall not exceed a maximum annual amount of EUR 150 million (2011 prices) over and above the relevant
headings of the financial framework.
The rules applicable to financial contributions from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) are laid down in Regulation (EU) No
1309/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (2014-2020) and repealing
Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 (the 'EGF Regulation').
In this context, the Commission examined the application for mobilisation of the EGF to assist Germany and concluded the following:
Germany: EGF/2014/014 DE/Aleo Solar: the German authorities submitted application EGF/2014/014 DE/Aleo Solar for a financial
contribution from the EGF, following redundancies in aleo solar AG and two subsidiaries in Germany.
The German authorities submitted the application within 12 weeks of the date on which the intervention criteria set out below were met. The
deadline expired on 16 December 2014.
In order to establish the link between the redundancies and major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation, Germany
states that aleo solar was a German company within the Robert Bosch Group, which is only one of many European solar enterprises that have
become insolvent in the same sector.
According the conclusions of a 2011 study, the sector of activity increased by 79% from $21 billion to $36 billion (2005-2011) in a market

where installations grew by 129%. However, Chinese and Taiwanese companies were able to grow revenue faster than German and US
companies. Market share of German companies continued to slide. Thus, between 2005 and 2011, the revenue share of China increased from
11% to 45%, while that of Germany fell from 64% to 21%. The only other EU Member State with a production significant enough to be listed, is
Spain with 1%.
Aleo solar in 2010 had a turnover of EUR 550 million and a profit of EUR 43 million. This declined rapidly from 2011 and by 2013 had reached
losses of EUR 92 million. Employment in the company meanwhile declined from 995 in 2011 to 740 in 2013. Despite various efforts to
restructure and improve efficiency, it did not manage to return to profitability, and future prospects were no better. Aleo solar went into
liquidation and closed or sold off its facilities, while some other German solar companies struggling with losses moved production to the Far
East, e.g. Malaysia.
To date, solar module manufacturing has been the subject of two EGF applications (including this one), both of which were based on trade
related globalisation.
The application relates to 657 workers made redundant in aleo solar AG and its two subsidiaries. Aleo solar operated in the economic sector
classified under NACE Rev. 2 division 26 ('Manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products'). The redundancies made by the
enterprises concerned are located in the NUTS level 2 regions of Brandenburg (DE 40) and Weser-Ems (DE 94).
Basis of the German application: the German authorities submitted the application under the intervention criteria of Article 4(1)(a) of the EGF
Regulation, which requires at least 500 workers being made redundant or self-employed persons' activity ceasing, over a reference period of
four months in an enterprise in a Member State, including workers made redundant and / or self-employed persons' activity ceasing in its
suppliers and downstream producers.
The application relates to 390 workers made redundant in aleo solar AG during the reference period of four months, and 267 workers made
redundant in its two subsidiaries during the same reference period.
The Commission therefore proposes to mobilise the EGF for the amount of EUR 1 094 760.
FINANCIAL IMPLICATION: having examined the application in respect of the conditions set out in Article 13(1) of the EGF Regulation, and
having taken into account the number of targeted beneficiaries, the proposed actions and the estimated costs, the Commission proposes to
mobilise the EGF for the amount of EUR 1 094 760, representing 60 % of the total costs of the proposed actions, in order to provide a financial
contribution for the application.
The proposed decision to mobilise the EGF will be taken jointly by the European Parliament and the Council, as laid down in point 13 of the
Interinstitutional Agreement of 2 December 2013 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline,
on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management.
At the same time as it presents this proposal for a decision to mobilise the EGF, the Commission will present a proposal for a transfer to the
relevant budgetary line for the requested amount.
At the same time as it adopts this proposal for a decision to mobilise the EGF, the Commission will adopt a decision on a financial contribution,
by means of an implementing act, which will enter into force on the date at which the European Parliament and the Council adopt the
proposed decision to mobilise the EGF.

2015/2018(BUD) - 02/03/2015 Budgetary report tabled for plenary, 1st reading
The Committee on Budgets adopted the report by Iris HOFFMANN (S&D, DE) on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and
of the Council on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for an amount of EUR 1 094 760 to assist Germany affected
by redundancies in the solar module producing industry.
Members recalled that the Union set up legislative and budgetary instruments to provide additional support to workers who are suffering from
the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns and to assist their reintegration into the labour market.
German application: the German authorities submitted application EGF/2014/014 DE/Aleo Solar for a financial contribution from the EGF,
following 657 redundancies, 390 from Aleo Solar AG, a company operating in the NACE 2 Division 26 'Manufacturing of computer, electronic
and optical products', and 267 from its two subsidiaries, with 476 persons expected to participate in the measures, during and after the
reference period from 7 March 2014 to 7 July 2014. The conditions set out in Article 4(1)(a) of the EGF Regulation are met. Therefore,
Germany is entitled to a financial contribution under that Regulation.
Members welcomed the fact that, in order to provide workers with speedy assistance, the German authorities decided to initiate the
implementation of the personalised services to the affected workers on 11 April 2014, well ahead of the decision and even the application on
granting the EGF support for the proposed coordinated package.
Nature of the redundancies: Members considered that the redundancies in Aleo Solar AG are linked to major structural changes in world trade
patterns due to globalisation. The redundancies at Aleo Solar AG are expected to have a negative impact on the Prenzlau/Brandenburg
region, where per capita income is well below the national average and the unemployment rate the highest in Germany with 15.5% and 16.4%
respectively.
Package of personalised services: Members noted that the coordinated package of personalised services to be co-funded includes the
following measures for the reintegration of 476 redundant workers into employment (vocational training, careers advice and guidance, peer
groups/workshops, entrepreneurship advice, inter-regional advice for mobility, etc).
They noted that the authorities plan to utilise the maximum allowed 35% of all costs on allowances and incentives in the form of training
allowances (Transferkurzarbeitergeld) constituting 60% or 67% of a worker's previous net income depending on the household situation of the
beneficiary which is in line with the practice where workers become unemployed in Germany.
The training allowance is not a substitute for passive social protection measures.
Members also considered that workers in the 55-64 and 15-29 age groups are at a higher risk of prolonged unemployment and exclusion from

the labour market. They considered therefore that these workers have specific needs when it comes to providing them with personalised
approach.
They regretted that the risk of long-term unemployment for the redundant workers is high and stressed therefore the importance of measures
encouraging workers to look beyond the immediate area and take up job offers which can be found in other regions. They recalled the
importance of improving the employability of all workers by means of adapted training and the recognition of skills and competences gained
throughout a worker's professional career.
Lastly, they also stressed that EGF assistance can co-finance only active labour market measures which lead to durable, long-term
employment.

2015/2018(BUD) - 10/03/2015 Budgetary text adopted by Parliament
The European Parliament adopted by 466 votes to 80, with 68 abstentions, a resolution on the proposal for a decision of the European
Parliament and of the Council on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for an amount of EUR 1 094 760 to assist

2015/2018(BUD) - 11/03/2015 Final act
PURPOSE: to mobilise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) to assist Germany following redundancies in its solar modular
producing industry.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision (EU) 2015/473 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the mobilisation of the European
Globalisation Adjustment Fund (application EGF/2014/014 DE/Aleo Solar, from Germany).
CONTENT: with this Decision, the European Parliament and the Council have decided to mobilise the sum of EUR 1 094 760 in commitment
and payment appropriations from European Globalisation Adjustment Fund within the framework of the general budget of the European Union
for the financial year 2015.
This amount shall assist Germany in respect of redundancies in Aleo Solar AG and two of its subsidiaries.
Given that the German application fulfils the conditions laid down in Regulation (EU) No 1309/2013 (EGF Regulation 2014-2020), the
European Parliament and the Council decided to grant the abovementioned amount.
To recall, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund was established to provide support for workers made redundant and self-employed

persons whose activity has ceased as a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation, as a result of a
continuation of the global financial and economic crisis addressed in Regulation (EC) No 546/2009 of the European Parliament and of the
Council, or as a result of a new global financial and economic crisis and to assist them with their reintegration into the labour market.
Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 laying down the multiannual financial framework for the years 2014-2020 provides that the EGF shall
not exceed a maximum annual amount of EUR 150 million.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 11.03.2015.
