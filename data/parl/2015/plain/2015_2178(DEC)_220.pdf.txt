2015/2178(DEC) - 23/07/2015 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: presentation by the Commission of the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2014, as part of
the 2014 discharge procedure.
Analysis of the accounts of the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA).
CONTENT: this Commission document sets out the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2014 as
prepared on the basis of the information presented by the institutions, organisations and bodies of the EU, in accordance with Article 148 (2) of
the Financial Regulation applicable to the EU's General Budget, including the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA).
The document contains the figures on which the discharge procedure is based.
On this basis, the Financial Controller of the European Commission ensures the certification of the consolidated accounts as declared by the
institutions, agencies and bodies of the European Union.
Discharge procedure of the EU agencies: the EU Budget finances a wide range of policies and programmes throughout the EU. In accordance
with the priorities set by the European Parliament and the Council in the multi-annual financial framework (MFF), the European Commission
carries out specific programmes, activities and projects in the field with the technical support of some specialised agencies.
The consolidated annual accounts of the EU provide information on the activities of the institutions, agencies and other bodies of the EU from
a budgetary and accrual accounting perspective.
The consolidated reports on the implementation of the general budget of the EU include the budget implementation of all Institutions. Agencies
do not have a separate budget inside the EU budget; and they are partially financed by a Commission budget subsidy.
This document sets out how the Agencies spent and implemented their budget in 2014. Each agency is subject to its own discharge
procedure.
ENISA: in 2014, the tasks and budget of this agency were as follows:

description of the Agency's tasks: ENISA, which is located in Heraklion, Greece, was established under Regulation 460/2004/EC of
the European Parliament and of the Council. Its main task is to enhance the Community's capability to prevent and respond to network
and information security problems by building on national and Community efforts;
ENISA's budget for the 2014 financial year: the Agencys budget for 2014, as presented in the Commission document on the
consolidated annual accounts of the European Union, gives the following figures:
Commitment appropriations :
- committed : EUR 10 million;
- paid : EUR 10 million;
- carried-over : EUR 1 million.
Payment appropriations :
- committed : EUR 11 million;
- paid : EUR 10 million;
- carried-over : EUR 1 million.
Please refer also to the final accounts of the ENISA.

2015/2178(DEC) - 08/09/2015 Court of Auditors: opinion, report
PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the European Network and Information Security Agency
(ENISA) for the year 2014, together with the Agencys reply.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit concerned, amongst others, the annual accounts of the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA).
Statement of assurance: pursuant to the provisions of Article 287 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the Court
has audited:
the annual accounts of the Agency, which comprise the financial statements and the reports on the implementation of the budget for
the financial year ended 31 December 2014, and
the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying those accounts.
Opinion on the reliability of the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the Agencys annual accounts present fairly, in all material respects, its
financial position as at 31 December 2014 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the
provisions of its Financial Regulation and the accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
Opinion on the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the transactions underlying the annual
accounts for the year ended 31 December 2014 are legal and regular in all material respects.
The report also makes a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of the Agency, accompanied by the latters
response. The main observations may be summarised as follows:
The Courts observations:
budgetary management: the Court noted that the committed appropriations carried over to 2015 amount to EUR 1.3 million, i.e. 15 %
of total appropriations concerned mainly administrative expenditure. These were linked to investments in IT infrastructure ordered as
planned near the year-end for the Agencys two offices.
The Agencys reply: the Agency noted that the high level of committed appropriations is explained by the EUR 500 000 carry-over in order to
finance furniture and networking equipment for the Athens office which was ordered towards the year-end.
Lastly, the Court of Auditors report contains a summary of the Agencys activities in 2014. This is focused on the following:
Budget: EUR 9.7 million of which the Union subsidy is 94 %.
Activities:
support EU policy building: during 2014, ENISA provided support for the policy marking process by making available to policy makers
consolidated information on the emerging threat landscape and by formulating key messages to the Member States on how to ensure
that their policies and capabilities are aligned with EU objectives;
support capacity building: a number of activities aimed at supporting ENISAs key stakeholders in developing new operational and
policy capabilities to address the various challenges in cybersecurity and to extend existing capabilities were carried out during 2014.
ENISAs activities carried out within this work stream were aimed at raising the level of security across Member States and the private
sector by collecting and disseminating good practice for public and private sectors and for the European citizen in general;
support cooperation: in 2014, ENISA supported cooperation by continuing to build trust, bridging the gap between the products and
services offered in the market and their needs, and continuously updating the information provided to those implementing NIS policy.
Another means to support cooperation covered in 2014 addressed the development of tools to facilitate and improve the international
communication and interchange of security-relevant information within communities sharing the same interest in different Member
States.

2015/2178(DEC) - 27/01/2016 Supplementary non-legislative basic document
Having examined the revenue and expenditure accounts for the financial year 2014 and the balance sheet as at 31 December 2014 of the
European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA), as well as the Court of Auditors' report on the annual accounts of the Agency for
the financial year 2014, accompanied by the Agency's replies to the Court's observations, the Council recommended the European Parliament
to give a discharge to the Executive Director of the Agency in respect of the implementation of the budget for the financial year 2014.
The Council welcomed the Court's opinion that, in all material respects, the Agency's annual accounts present fairly its financial position as at
31 December 2014 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions of the
Agency's Financial Regulation, and that the underlying transactions for 2014 are legal and regular in all material respects.
Nevertheless, the Council has made some observations which may be summarised as follows:
financial programming: the Council called on the Agency to continue improving its financial programming and monitoring of the budget
implementation, in order to reduce the level of commitments carried over to the following year to the strict minimum, in line with the
budgetary principle of annuality.

2015/2178(DEC) - 07/04/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Derek VAUGHAN (S&D, UK) on discharge in respect of the implementation of the
budget of the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security for the financial year 2014.
The parliamentary committee calls on the European Parliament to grant the Executive Director of the Agency discharge in respect of the
implementation of the agencys budget for the financial year 2014.
Noting that the Court of Auditors issued a statement of assurance as to the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the
underlying transactions for the financial year 2014, Members call on Parliament to approve the closure of the Agencys accounts. They made,
however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is granted, in addition to the general
recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies:
Agencys financial statements: Members note the final budget of the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security for
the financial year 2014 was EUR 9 708 297, representing an increase of 0.39 % compared to 2013.
Commitments and carryovers: Members note that the total amount of committed appropriations carried over to 2015 amounted to EUR
1 332 421 (15 % of total appropriations). Noting considerable carryovers, Members highlighted that these related to investments in IT
infrastructure ordered as planned near the year end for the Agencys two offices.
Members also made a series of observations regarding payment transfers, as well as contract award, recruitment and internal audit and
control procedures.
Members acknowledge that the Agency adopted internal policies in order to improve cost effectiveness and the environmental friendliness of
its facilities and that an important step towards satisfying both requirements was the adoption of a paperless platform serving as workflow and
storage of internal documents. Thus the Agency has practically eliminated all paper-based workflows, including financial transactions and
human resources files and documents, and replaced them with electronic documents and workflows in an effort to achieve a paperless office
environment.
They acknowledge that, as a follow up from the 2013 discharge of the Agency, according to the lease agreement between the Greek
authorities, the Agency and the landlord, rent for the offices in Athens is paid by the Greek authorities. They are concerned by the constant late
payment of rent, which continued in 2014 and 2015 and which presents significant reputational, financial and business-continuity risks for the
Agency. They urge the Commission, the Agency and the Greek authorities to find a solution for this issue in order to reduce significantly the
risks to which the Agency is exposed.

2015/2178(DEC) - 28/04/2016 Final act
PURPOSE: to grant discharge to the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) for the financial year 2014.
NON LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision (EU) 2016/1543 of the European Parliament on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of
the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security for the financial year 2014.
CONTENT: with the present decision, the European Parliament grants discharge to the Executive Director of the European Union Agency for
Network and Information Security for the implementation of its budget for the financial year 2014.
This decision is in line with the European Parliament's resolution adopted on 28 April 2016 and comprises a series of observations that form
an integral part of the discharge decision (please refer to the summary of the opinion of 28 April 2016).
Amongst Parliaments main observations in the resolution accompanying the discharge decision, the latter stated that the rent for the offices in
Athens is paid by the Greek authorities. It expressed concern about the constant late payment of rent, which continued in 2014 and 2015 and
which presents significant reputational, financial and business-continuity risks for the Agency. It urged the Commission, the Agency and the
Greek authorities to find a solution for this issue.
