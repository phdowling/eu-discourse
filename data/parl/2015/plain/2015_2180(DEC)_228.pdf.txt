2015/2180(DEC) - 23/07/2015 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: presentation by the Commission of the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2014, as part of
the 2014 discharge procedure.
Analysis of the accounts of the European Police College (CEPOL).
CONTENT: this Commission document sets out the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2014 as
prepared on the basis of the information presented by the institutions, organisations and bodies of the EU, in accordance with Article 148 (2) of
the Financial Regulation applicable to the EU's General Budget, including the European Police College (CEPOL).
The document contains the figures on which the discharge procedure is based.
On this basis, the Financial Controller of the European Commission ensures the certification of the consolidated accounts as declared by the
institutions, agencies and bodies of the European Union.
Discharge procedure of the EU agencies: the EU Budget finances a wide range of policies and programmes throughout the EU. In accordance
with the priorities set by the European Parliament and the Council in the multi-annual financial framework (MFF), the European Commission
carries out specific programmes, activities and projects in the field with the technical support of some specialised agencies.
The consolidated annual accounts of the EU provide information on the activities of the institutions, agencies and other bodies of the EU from
a budgetary and accrual accounting perspective.
The consolidated reports on the implementation of the general budget of the EU include the budget implementation of all Institutions. Agencies
do not have a separate budget inside the EU budget; and they are partially financed by a Commission budget subsidy.

This document sets out how the Agencies spent and implemented their budget in 2014. Each agency is subject to its own discharge
procedure.
CEPOL: in 2014, the tasks and budget of this agency were as follows:
description of CEPOL's tasks: CEPOL, which is located in Budapest (HU) since October 2014 was established by Council Decision
2005/681/JHA. The College's main task is to provide training sessions, based on common standards, for senior police officers;
CEPOL's budget for the 2014 financial year: CEPOLs budget for 2014, as presented in the Commission document on the consolidated
annual accounts of the European Union, gives the following figures:
Commitment appropriations :
- committed : EUR 9 million;
- paid : EUR 8 million;
- carried-over : 0.
Payment appropriations :
- committed : EUR 10 million;
- paid : EUR 8 million;
- carried-over : EUR 2 million.
Please refer also to the final accounts of CEPOL.

2015/2180(DEC) - 08/09/2015 Court of Auditors: opinion, report
PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the European Police College (CEPOL) for the financial
year 2014, together with the Colleges reply.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit concerned, amongst others, the annual accounts of the European Police College (CEPOL).
Statement of Assurance: pursuant to the provisions of Article 287 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the Court
has audited:
the annual accounts of the College, which comprise the financial statements and the reports on the implementation of the budget for
the financial year ended 31 December 2014;
the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying those accounts.
Opinion on the reliability of the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the Colleges annual accounts present fairly, in all material respects, its
financial position as at 31 December 2014 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the
provisions of its Financial Regulation and the accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
Opinion on the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the accounts: the Court considers that the transactions underlying the
annual accounts for the year ended 31 December 2014 are legal and regular in all material respects.
The report also makes a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of the College, accompanied by the latters
response. The main observations may be summarised as follows:
The Courts observations:
budgetary management: the Court notes that the cancellation rate for committed appropriations carried over from 2013 was high at
15 %, mainly because of the cancellation of a project and the lower than estimated costs to be reimbursed under the 2013 grant
agreements (around EUR 60 000). The level of committed appropriations carried over was also high for administrative expenditure, at
59 % of the total. This was driven in large part by the high volume of furniture and IT equipment, and the maintenance required, for the
Colleges new premises, ordered but not yet delivered and/or paid for in the last quarter of 2014.
CEPOLs replies:
budgetary management: CEPOL indicates that it has significantly reduced the amount carried forward and cancelled funds. It is
committed to further increase and maintain compliance with the budgetary principle of annuality provided in the Financial Regulation.
Lastly, the Court of Auditors report contains a summary of the Colleges activities in 2014. This is focused on the following:
Budget: EUR 8.8 million.
Activities:
71 residential activities (courses, seminars and conferences);
bringing together 2 098 law enforcement participants, and 710 trainers from 34 countries (EU Member States and third countries) and
24 EU and international bodies;
attendance rate (attendance v seats available) of 108 %;
with regard to external relations, in 2014 CEPOL continued its cooperation with candidate, potential candidate and European
Neighbourhood countries as well as strategic partners, JHA agencies and EU institutions, including the European External Action

Service. It has concluded the negotiations for two working arrangements, one with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and
one with Bosnia and Herzegovina.
with respect to research, CEPOL published two new issues of the European Science and Research Bulletin on the website and in
print;
CEPOL ran its European Police Exchange Programme particularly with the Western Balkans;
CEPOL promoted e-learning with a new graphical user interface and E-Campus Policing Europe aimed at the development and delivery of
learning assignments on cross-border police cooperation matters.

2015/2180(DEC) - 27/01/2016 Supplementary non-legislative basic document
Having examined the revenue and expenditure accounts for the financial year 2014 and the balance sheet as at 31 December 2014 of the
European Police College (CEPOL), as well as the Court of Auditors' report on the annual accounts of the College for the financial year 2014,
accompanied by the College's replies to the Court's observations, the Council recommended the European Parliament to give a discharge to
the Director of the College in respect of the implementation of the budget for the financial year 2014.
The Council welcomed the Court's opinion that, in all material respects, the College's annual accounts present fairly its financial position as at
31 December 2014 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions of the
College's Financial Regulation, and that the underlying transactions for 2014 are legal and regular in all material respects. Nevertheless, the
Council made the following observation:
financial programming: the Council called on the College to improve its financial programming and monitoring of the budget
implementation in order to improve budget execution, to avoid the cancellation of appropriations and to reduce the amounts carried
over to the next financial year to the strict minimum, in line with the budgetary principle of annuality.

2015/2180(DEC) - 07/04/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Derek VAUGHAN (S&D, UK) on discharge in respect of the implementation of the
budget of the European Police College for the financial year 2014.
The parliamentary committee calls on the European Parliament to grant the Director of the College discharge in respect of the implementation
of the Colleges budget for the financial year 2014.
Noting that the Court of Auditors issued a statement of assurance as to the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the
underlying transactions for the financial year 2014, Members call on Parliament to approve the closure of the Colleges accounts. They made,
however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is granted, in addition to the general
recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies:
·

Colleges financial statements: Members note the final budget of the European Police College for the financial year 2014 was EUR 8
575 859, representing an increase of 1.48 % compared to 2013.

·

Commitments and carryovers: Members note with concern the cancellation rate for committed appropriations carried over from 2013
at EUR 129 828 (15%). They point out that the high cancellation rate resulted mainly from the cancellation of the Matrix project as
well as from lower-than-estimated costs to be reimbursed under the 2013 grant agreements. They call on the College to prepare a
proper user analysis for similar projects and to obtain more accurate information from its beneficiaries when estimating grant costs.

Members also made a series of observations regarding budget and financial management, the prevention and management of conflicts of
interest, as well as contract award, recruitment and internal audit and control procedures.
In terms of performance, Members note that the cost of relocation of the College from the United Kingdom to Hungary has been estimated at
EUR 1 006 515, of which 43 % has been financed by the College via savings derived from the lower correction coefficient applied to staff
entitlements in Hungary, the remaining amount being financed equally by contributions from the Commission and the United Kingdom.
Lastly, Members call on the College to enhance its procedures and practices aimed at safeguarding the financial interests of the Union.

2015/2180(DEC) - 28/04/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading

the Colleges budget for the financial year 2014. The vote on the decision on discharge covers the closure of the accounts (in accordance with
Annex 5, Article 5 (1) (a) to Parliaments Rules of Procedure.

2014 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Parliament adopted by 511 votes to 114 with 13 abstentions, a
resolution containing a series of recommendations, which form an integral part of the decision on discharge and which add to the general
