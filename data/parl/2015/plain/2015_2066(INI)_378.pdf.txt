2015/2066(INI) - 05/11/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The European Parliaments Special Committee on Tax Rulings adopted a report by the co-rapporteurs Elisa Ferreira (S&D, PT) and Michael
Theurer (ALDE, DE) on tax rulings and other measures similar in nature or effect.
To recall, the LuxLeaks scandal, which erupted on 5 November 2014, revealed the extent of the use of secret deals featuring complex financial
structures designed to obtain drastic tax reductions. The scandal brought public and media attention to those issues, disclosing questionable
tax practices promoted by accountancy firms in one specific Member State. Members noted the Commissions investigations and the work
carried out by Parliament through its special committee had shown that this was not the only case, but that taking tax measures to reduce
some large corporations overall tax liabilities so as to artificially increase the national tax base at the expense of other countries, some of
which were subject to austerity measures, was a practice that was widespread within Europe and beyond.
Bearing this mind, the Special Committee made the following recommendations:
Place of taxation: Members noted that aggressive tax planning by multinational corporations (MNCs) often result in disconnection between
where value is created and where profits are taxed. They called on Member States to respect the principle of profits taxation in the place they
are generated, stressing that new entrants and firms, including SMEs, that do not use aggressive tax practices are penalised as compared
with multinationals, which are able to shift profits only by virtue of their size and their ability to arrange business internationally. The Special
Committee noted with concern that, all other things being equal, the resulting lower tax liabilities leave multinational corporations (MNCs) with
a higher post-tax profit and thereby create an uneven playing field with their competitors on the single market. This distortion of a level playing
field in favour of multinationals contradicts the fundamental principle of the single market. The report called on the Member States to:
put an end to harmful tax competition and fully cooperate in order to eliminate mismatches between tax systems and harmful tax
measures which create the conditions for massive tax avoidance by MNCs and tax base erosion within the internal market;
notify the Commission and other Member States about any relevant changes to their corporate taxation law that could have an impact
on their effective tax rates or on any other Member States tax revenue;
make new clear political commitments to taking urgent action to tackle this situation , which can no longer be tolerated, not least
because of its impact on national budgets, which are already subjected to fiscal consolidation measures, and on the tax contributions
of other taxpayers, including SMEs and citizens. Members stressed, in this context, that it intends to play its role fully and is ready to
put in place more effective.
Cooperation and coordination on advance tax rulings: the report deplored the content of the political agreement of 6 October 2015 within the
Council, which falls short of the Commissions legislative proposal of March 2015 amending Directive 2011/16/EU as regards mandatory
automatic exchange of information in the field of taxation. It called on the Council to stick to the Commissions proposal and take due account

of the Parliaments opinion thereon, in particular as regards: (i) the scope of the directive (all tax rulings instead of cross-border only), (ii) the
retroactivity period (all tax rulings still valid should be exchanged) and (iii) the information provided to the Commission, which should have
access to the tax rulings.
The Special Committee considered that the basic elements of all rulings that have an impact on other Member States should be not only
shared between tax administrations and the Commission, but also presented in the country-by-country reporting by MNCs.
Transparency: Members felt that increased transparency regarding the activities of multinational companies is essential for ensuring that tax
administrations are able to efficiently combat Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS). All MNCs in all sectors should disclose in their financial
statements, broken down by Member State and by third country in which they have an establishment, a range of aggregate information,
including their profit or loss before tax, taxes on profit or loss, number of employees, assets held, basic information about tax rulings
(country-by-country reporting). This information should be made available to the public, possibly in the form of a central EU register.
Member States are asked to implement a more extensive country-by-country reporting system available to tax authorities, building on the
OECD standard and including more detailed information, such as tax returns and intra-group transactions.
Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB): whilst welcoming the action plan proposed by the Commission on 17 June 2015 to
address tax avoidance, the report called on the Commission to speed up work on a compulsory EU-wide Common Consolidated Corporate
Tax Base (CCCTB), which would address not only the issue of preferential regimes and mismatches between national tax systems, but also
most of the issues leading to tax base erosion at European level (in particular transfer pricing issues). Pending the adoption of a full CCCTB
and its full implementation at EU level, the Commission was asked, inter alia, to:
take immediate action in order to ensure effective taxation, reduce profit shifting (mainly through transfer pricing);
prepare an interim regime offsetting cross-border profits and losses, which should be temporary in nature and with sufficient
guarantees that it will not create any further opportunity for aggressive tax planning, and further introduce anti-abuse rules in all
relevant directives;
The Commission should also issue clear legislation on the definition of economic substance, value creation and permanent establishment, with
a view to tackling the issue of letterbox companies, and to develop EU criteria and legislation for the treatment of R&D.
State aid: in this regard, Members called on the Commission to:
adopt new guidelines, at the latest by mid-2017, in the framework of its State Aid Modernisation initiative, clarifying what constitutes
tax-related state aid and appropriate transfer pricing, with a view to removing legal uncertainties for both compliant taxpayers and tax
administrations;
extend its investigations to other MNCs mentioned in the LuxLeaks scandal and to measures similar in nature or effect to transfer
pricing;
consider setting up a network of national tax administrations to exchange best practices and more consistently contribute to preventing
the introduction of any tax measures that might constitute illegal state aid.
Code of Conduct on business taxation: Members called for an urgent reform of the Code of Conduct on business taxation and of the Group
responsible for its enforcement, given that, to date it has proved to be of questionable value. The reform should aim to address both real
obstacles currently in the way of effectively tackling harmful tax practices and an EU-wide coordination and cooperation on tax policy.
Protection of whistleblowers: the report called on the Commission to propose, by June 2016, an EU legislative framework for the effective
protection of whistleblowers and the like. It stressed that it is not acceptable that citizens and journalists can be subject to prosecution rather
than legal protection when, acting in the public interest, they report suspected illegal activity, in particular in cases of tax avoidance, tax
evasion and money laundering. The Commission was asked to consider a range of tools for ensuring such protection against unjustified legal
prosecution, economic sanctions and discrimination.

2015/2066(INI) - 25/11/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 508 votes to 108, with 85 abstentions a resolution on tax rulings and other measures similar in nature or
effect.
To recall, the LuxLeaks scandal, which erupted on 5 November 2014, revealed the extent of the use of secret deals featuring complex financial
structures designed to obtain drastic tax reductions. In many cases Luxembourg subsidiaries handling hundreds of millions of euros in
business maintained little presence and conduct little economic activity in Luxembourg.
The scandal brought public and media attention to those issues, disclosing questionable tax practices promoted by accountancy firms in one
specific Member State. Members noted the Commissions investigations and the work carried out by Parliament through its special committee
had shown that this was not the only case, but that taking tax measures to reduce some large corporations overall tax liabilities so as to
artificially increase the national tax base at the expense of other countries, some of which were subject to austerity measures, was a practice
that was widespread within Europe and beyond.
Parliament considered that subjecting these practices to public scrutiny was part of democratic control.
It discussed corporate tax practices and aggressive tax planning, and noted the following:
owing to the great diversity of the 28 tax systems in the EU, as regards both the definition of the tax base and the level of the tax rate,
basic notions, such as the balance between source and residence taxation, permanent establishment and taxable entities, and the
treatment of debt and equity, were not subject to any joint definition or guidelines in the EU, leaving Member States with
uncoordinated tax systems. Members stressed that it was necessary to harmonise these definitions;
tax avoidance by some multinational corporations (MNCs) can result in close-to-zero effective tax rates for the profits generated in
European jurisdictions, highlighting the fact that such MNCs, while benefiting from various public goods and services where they
operate, do not pay their fair share;
the possibility of shifting profits is only available to companies undertaking cross-border activities which penalises competitors only
active in one country;

corporate tax avoidance means that some of those taxpayers with the highest ability to pay contribute significantly less than those
most affected by the economic, financial and debt crisis, such as ordinary citizens and firms not using aggressive tax planning;
research by the IMF covering 51 countries concludes that profit shifting between tax jurisdictions results in an average revenue loss of
about 5 % of current corporate income tax revenue but of almost 13 % in non-OECD countries;
despite the significant number of legal disputes in the EU stemming from differing interpretations of the same transfer pricing
principles, no efficient dispute resolution mechanism is in place at European level.
Bearing this in mind, Parliament made the following recommendations:
Tax gap: Parliament called on the Commission to more thoroughly address corporate taxation issues, including harmful tax practices and their
impact, in the framework of the European Semester and for relevant indicators, including estimates of the tax gap arising from tax evasion and
tax avoidance, to be included in the macroeconomic imbalance procedure.
Cooperation and coordination on advance tax rulings: Parliament deplored the content of the political agreement of 6 October 2015 within the
Council, which falls short of the Commissions legislative proposal of March 2015 amending Directive 2011/16/EU as regards mandatory
automatic exchange of information in the field of taxation. It called on the Council to stick to the Commissions proposal and take due account
of the Parliaments opinion thereon, in particular as regards: (i) the scope of the directive (all tax rulings instead of cross-border only), (ii) the
retroactivity period (all tax rulings still valid should be exchanged) and (iii) the information provided to the Commission, which should have
access to the tax rulings.
Parliament reiterated its position that MNCs in all sectors should disclose comprehensibly in their financial statements, broken down by
Member State and by third country in which they have an establishment, a range of aggregate information, including their profit or loss before
tax, taxes on profit or loss, number of employees, assets held, basic information about tax rulings (country-by-country reporting).
Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB): whilst welcoming the action plan proposed by the Commission on 17 June 2015 to
address tax avoidance, the report called on the Commission to speed up work on a compulsory EU-wide Common Consolidated Corporate
Tax Base (CCCTB), which would address not only the issue of preferential regimes and mismatches between national tax systems, but also
most of the issues leading to tax base erosion at European level (in particular transfer pricing issues). It also called on the Commission to:
include in its proposals provisions aimed at clarifying the definition of R&D investments and of permanent establishment in line with
economic substance, covering the digital economy. In this connection, Parliament stressed the problems with aggressive tax planning
involving patent boxes, noting that the existing evidence shows that patent boxes do not help in spurring innovation and can lead to
major base erosion through profit shifting;
restore the link between taxation and economic substance and to ensure that taxes are paid in the countries where actual economic
activity and value creation take place;
consider carefully Parliaments position on CCCBT and to adopt a formula apportionment which reflects the real economic activities of
companies;
take immediate action in order to ensure effective taxation, reduce profit shifting (mainly through transfer pricing);
prepare an interim regime offsetting cross-border profits and losses, which should be temporary in nature and with sufficient
guarantees that it will not create any further opportunity for aggressive tax planning, and further introduce anti-abuse rules in all
relevant directives;
issue clear legislation on the definition of economic substance, value creation and permanent establishment, with a view to tackling
the issue of letterbox companies.
State aid: Parliament underlined the fact that some harmful tax practices may fall within the scope of tax-related state aid rules, in so far as
that they can, grant selective advantage and entail distortions of competition within the internal market. In this regard, it called on the
Commission to:
adopt new guidelines, at the latest by mid-2017, in the framework of its State Aid Modernisation initiative, clarifying what constitutes
tax-related state aid and appropriate transfer pricing, with a view to removing legal uncertainties for both compliant taxpayers and tax
administrations;
extend its investigations to other MNCs mentioned in the LuxLeaks scandal and to measures similar in nature or effect to transfer
pricing;
consider setting up a network of national tax administrations to exchange best practices and more consistently contribute to preventing
the introduction of any tax measures that might constitute illegal state aid.
modify the existing rules to ensure that sanctions can be adopted against the relevant countries and companies in case of breach of
state aid rules.
Code of Conduct Group: Parliament deplored the fact that the work of the Code of Conduct Group on Business Taxation work seems to have
lost momentum, noting that tax authorities have countered the Groups recommendations by creating new structures with the same harmful
effects as those rolled back by the Group.
Members called for an urgent reform of the Code of Conduct on business taxation and of the Group responsible for its enforcement, given that,
to date it has proved to be of questionable value. The reform should aim to address both real obstacles currently in the way of effectively
tackling harmful tax practices and an EU-wide coordination and cooperation on tax policy.
Protection of whistleblowers: Parliament called on the Commission to propose, by June 2016, an EU legislative framework for the effective
protection of whistleblowers and the like. It stressed that it is not acceptable that citizens and journalists can be subject to prosecution rather
than legal protection when, acting in the public interest, they report suspected illegal activity, in particular in cases of tax avoidance, tax
evasion and money laundering. The Commission was asked to consider a range of tools for ensuring such protection against unjustified legal
prosecution, economic sanctions and discrimination.
Exchange of information: Parliament found that Member States did not comply with the obligations set out in Council Directives 77/799/EEC
and 2011/16/EU on enhanced administrative cooperation in the field of taxation. Member States did not and continue not to spontaneously
exchange tax information, even in cases where there were clear grounds, for expecting that there may be tax losses in other Member States,
or that tax savings may result from artificial transfers of profits within groups. Parliament deplored the fact that the current legislative and
monitoring framework for the exchange of information about tax measures is not effective, and that practically no Member State exchanges
any information which may have an effect on partner countries of the EU. It took the view that, among other things, a comprehensive,

transparent and effective automatic exchange of tax information and a mandatory common consolidated corporate tax base are essential
preconditions for achieving a tax system at EU level that complies with and preserves the basic principles of the internal market. The
Commission is asked to use all the tools at its disposal to foster a more coordinated approach vis-Ã -vis developed countries in order to
promote greater reciprocity in tax matters.
Tax havens: Members discussed the shifting of profits to low- or no-tax or secrecy jurisdictions where, often, no substantial economic activity
takes place, deploring the lack of a coordinated approach on the part of the Member States vis-Ã -vis all those jurisdictions. They called on the
Commission to:
continue its work on the development and adoption of a European definition, a common set of criteria to identify tax havens,
independently of their location, and appropriate sanctions for countries cooperating with them;
include in the European black list those territories that grant fiscal advantages to entities without requiring substantial economic activity
in the country, provide significantly low effective taxation and do not guarantee automatic exchange of tax information with other
jurisdictions;
ensure that EU bodies not to cooperate with those jurisdictions deemed to be uncooperative on tax matters, nor with companies
convicted of tax fraud, tax evasion or aggressive tax planning.
European Taxpayer Identification Number: lastly, Parliament called on the Commission to put forward a proposal for a European Taxpayer
Identification Number (TIN) based on the outline for a European TIN in the Commissions Action Plan on the fight against tax fraud and tax
evasion of 2012.
