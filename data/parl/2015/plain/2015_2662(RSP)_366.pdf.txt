Summary

The European Parliament adopted a resolution on the situation in the Maldives.
The text adopted in plenary had been jointly tabled by the EPP, S&D, ECR, ALDE, GUE/NGL, Greens/EFA and EFDD groups.
Expressing its grave concern about increasing tendencies towards authoritarian rule in the Maldives, the crackdown on political opponents and
intimidation of media and civil society, Parliament called on all parties to refrain from any action that may further aggravate this crisis, and to
respect democracy and the rule of law.
Parliament deplored the serious irregularities in the trial of former president Mohamed Nasheed, non-violent activist for human rights and
pluralistic democracy, sentenced to 13 years imprisonment under charges of terrorism for the arrest in January 2012. It insisted on his
immediate release and called for the respect for the rule of law, the right to a fair trial. It also urged the EU delegation to Sri Lanka and the
Maldives to insist to be allowed to follow closely the appeal process.
The resolution called for:
a credible and inclusive political process, with the participation of all democratic forces, with the aim of restoring and preserving
stability in the Maldives and putting the country back on the track of transition to democracy;
measures to restore confidence in its commitment to democracy, judicial independence, and the rule of law, including respect for the
freedoms of expression and of assembly and respect for due process;
an immediate end to political interference in, and for the de-politicisation of, the judicial system in the Maldives;
urgent reforms to ensure the independence and the impartiality of the Maldivian judiciary with the aim of restoring domestic and
international confidence in its functioning;
an immediate end to all forms of violence, including violence against peaceful protesters;
full compliance from the local authorities of the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking;
the re-establishment of the moratorium on the death penalty.
Lastly, the Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the EEAS are urged to continue
to monitor closely the political situation in the Maldives and to play a proactive role in the EUs bilateral relations with the country and in
international multilateral fora in order to achieve stability, strengthen democracy and the rule of law, and ensure full respect for human rights
and fundamental freedoms in the country.
