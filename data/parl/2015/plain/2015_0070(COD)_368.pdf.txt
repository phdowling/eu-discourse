2015/0070(COD) - 26/03/2015 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to fix the adjustment rate provided for in Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 for direct payments in respect of calendar year 2015.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: Article 25 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down that a reserve intended
to provide additional support for the agricultural sector in the case of major crises affecting the agricultural production or distribution has to be
established by applying, at the beginning of each year, a reduction to direct payments with the financial discipline mechanism referred to in
Article 26 of that Regulation.
Article 25 of this regulation determines that the total amount of the reserve for crises in agricultural sector shall be EUR 2 800 million with
equal annual instalments of EUR 400 million (at 2011 prices) for the period 2014-2020 and shall be included under Heading 2 of the

Multiannual Financial Framework.
The calculation of the financial discipline adjustment rate is part of the preparation of the 2016 Draft Budget. The amount of the reserve for
crises in the agricultural sector, foreseen to be included in the Commission 2016 Draft Budget, amounts to EUR 441.6 million in current prices.
Based on the first estimates of budget appropriations for direct payments and market related expenditure, the net balance available for EAGF
expenditure for 2016 is not likely to be exceeded.
Article 8(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 lays down that the adjustment rate applied to direct payments determined in accordance with
Article 26 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 is only to apply to direct payments in excess of EUR 2 000 to be granted to farmers in the
corresponding calendar year. Furthermore, it provides that as a result of the gradual introduction of direct payments, the adjustment rate is
only to apply to Bulgaria and Romania from 1 January 2016 and to Croatia from 1 January 2022.
The Commission has to present a proposal to the European Parliament and to the Council concerning the adjustment rate no later than 31
March of the calendar year in respect of which that adjustment rate applies.
CONTENT: this proposal aims to implement the provisions of Article 26 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 and Article 8 of Regulation (EU) No
1307/2013. It seeks to set the percentage rate of the financial discipline adjustment rate in respect of calendar year 2015 .
The proposed Regulation lays down the amounts of direct payments under the support schemes listed in Annex I to Regulation (EU) No
1307/2013 to be granted to a farmer in excess of EUR 2 000 for an aid application submitted in respect of calendar year 2015 shall be reduced
by 1.393041%. The reduction shall not apply in Bulgaria, Croatia and Romania.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the total reduction resulting from the application of financial discipline amounts to EUR 441.6 million. The
percentage of the financial discipline adjustment rate is 1.393041%.
The application of this adjustment rate will result in the reduction of the amounts of direct payments for budget lines covering expenditure
relating to aid applications submitted by farmers in respect of calendar year 2015 (financial year 2016).

2015/0070(COD) - 01/06/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development adopted the report by Czes?aw Adam SIEKIERSKI (EPP, PL) on the proposal for a
regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council fixing the adjustment rate provided for in Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 for direct
payments in respect of calendar year 2015.
The committee recommended that the European Parliament adopt its position at first reading taking over the Commission proposal.
The purpose of the proposed Regulation is to implement the provisions of Article 26 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 on the financing,
management and monitoring of the common agricultural policy and Article 8 of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 establishing rules for direct
payments to farmers under support schemes within the framework of the common agricultural policy. It seeks to set the percentage rate of the
financial discipline adjustment rate in respect of calendar year 2015.
The proposed Regulation lays down the amounts of direct payments under the support schemes listed in Annex I to Regulation (EU) No
1307/2013 to be granted to a farmer in excess of EUR 2 000 for an aid application submitted in respect of calendar year 2015 shall be reduced
by 1.393041%. The reduction shall not apply in Bulgaria, Croatia and Romania.

2015/0070(COD) - 09/06/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 544 votes to 78, with 9 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council fixing the adjustment rate provided for in Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 for direct payments in
respect of calendar year 2015.
Parliament adopted its position at first reading in which it approved, unamended, the Commission proposal.
This proposal seeks to set the percentage rate of the financial discipline adjustment rate in respect of calendar year 2015 . It lays down the
amounts of direct payments under the support schemes listed in Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 to be granted to a farmer in excess
of EUR 2 000 for an aid application submitted in respect of calendar year 2015 shall be reduced by 1.393041%. The reduction shall not apply
in Bulgaria, Croatia and Romania.
Until 1 December 2015, the adjustment rate fixed by this Regulation may be adapted by the Commission, on the basis of new information in its
possession.

direct payments is to be determined when the forecasts for the financing of the measures financed under that sub-ceiling for a given
financial year indicate that the applicable annual ceilings will be exceeded.
Article 8 of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 provides that the adjustment rate applied to direct payments determined in accordance with
Article 26 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 is to apply only to direct payments in excess of EUR 2 000 to be granted to farmers in the
corresponding calendar year. Furthermore, Article 8(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 provides that, as a result of the gradual
introduction of direct payments, the adjustment rate is to apply to Bulgaria and Romania only from 1 January 2016 and to Croatia only
from 1 January 2022.
