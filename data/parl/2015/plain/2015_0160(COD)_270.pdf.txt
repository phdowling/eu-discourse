2015/0160(COD) - 15/07/2015 Document attached to the procedure
PURPOSE: to mobilise the EU budget to provide a new start for jobs and growth in Greece.
BACKGROUND: at the Euro Summit of 12 July 2015, the Commission was asked to help support job and growth creation in Greece in the
next three to five years. It tasked the Commission to work closely with the Greek authorities to mobilise up to EUR 35 billion (under various EU
programmes) to fund investment and economic activity, including in SMEs. The decisions reached at the Euro Summit on 12 July 2015 testify
to the willingness of the Euro area to support Greece provided it takes the necessary steps to restore trust and credibility and return to
sustainability.
EU funding has been the primary source of public investment in Greece during the crisis. The support and relief from which Greece has
benefitted in recent years and will receive in coming years from the EU, Member States, other international parties and private investors
amounts to more than EUR 400 billion. This represents more than 230% of Greek GDP in 2014.
The situation remains difficult in Greece at this point in time. Tight financial conditions, uncertainty about the overall economic situation,
hesitations about priorities and remaining administrative bottlenecks are disrupting the investment plans of many actors, and putting into
question the ability of the authorities to make good and full use of the available EU funding.
An important number of projects for cohesion policy are currently at risk of not being completed. Moreover, if the Greek authorities do not
make full use of the EU funding which is still available under the 2007-2013 financing period by the end of 2015, an amount of nearly EUR 2
billion for cohesion policy, this unused funding would be lost. Moreover, for Greece to benefit from EU funding, it is also essential that basic
legal requirements, in terms of respect of EU rules, sound financial management of the funds and accounting, are fully respected.
CONTENT: the purpose of this Communication is to outline a renewed approach to the substantial means available from the EU budget to
serve as a new start for jobs and growth in Greece. This Communication will complement the comprehensive set of reforms and commitments
which Greece is in the process of implementing and which will underpin a stability support programme for Greece under the Treaty
establishing a European Stability Mechanism.
Mobilisation of EUR 35 million from the EU budget: with the support of the Commission, Greece is expected to be able to receive more than
EUR 35 billion from the EU budget over the 2014-2020 financing period.
EUR 20 billion from the European Structural and Investment Funds could be mobilised to create jobs and sustainable growth, and Greek
farmers should continue to benefit from direct payments of over EUR 15 billion.
Exceptional measures: Greece currently enjoys preferential treatment given its very specific circumstances. Greek programmes financed with
the EU funds under 2007-2013 programming period receive a higher proportion of EU financing and hence Greece is required to co-finance
less than many other countries.
Lately, the lack of availability of public funds has made it difficult for local and regional as well as national authorities to take forward much
needed investments.
As an exceptional measure and in light of the unique situation of Greece, the Commission:
proposes to improve immediate liquidity so that investments can still be funded in the 2007-2013 programming period. These will
include early release of the last 5% of remaining EU payments normally retained until the closure of the programmes and applying a
100% co-financing rate for the 2007-2013 period. This would translate into immediate additional liquidity of some EUR 500 million and
a saving for the Greek budget of around EUR 2 billion. This money will be available to immediately resume financing for investments
supporting growth and job;
proposes to increase the rate of initial pre-financing for programmes for 2014-2020 in Greece by 7 percentage points . This extra
pre-financing can make an additional EUR 1 billion available to be used only for the launch of the projects co-financed under the
cohesion policy.
All these measures will be implemented within the country allocations agreed in the current multi-financial framework for 2014-2020.
Technical support: Greece will also continue to benefit from technical support for reforms and implementation from the Commission's new
Structural Reform Support Service, which began its work on 1 July and builds on the valuable experience of the Task Force for Greece and
other technical assistance provided to Member States.
If requested by Greece, the Commission is ready to continue its support in designing and/or implementing structural and institutional reforms
within this new technical assistance framework. One immediate task would be to support Greece in maximising its absorption of EU funds,
ensuring the fastest possible take-off of investment and ensuring that sound financial management requirements and relevant deadlines are
met. Within the EU Funds under the 2014-2020 programming period, nearly half a billion euro is available for technical assistance in the area
of cohesion policy.
The Commission is also setting up a pilot Technical Assistance Trust-Fund of EUR 1.5 million , which is expected to be managed by the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).
The Investment Plan for Europe can play a crucial role for jobs and growth in Greece. The new European Fund for Strategic Investment (EFSI)
will benefit commercially viable investment projects in Greece.

2015/0160(COD) - 17/07/2015 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to ensure that Greece has sufficient financial means to start the implementation of 2014-2020 programmes supported by the
European Regional Development Fund (EARDF), the European Social Fund (ESF), the Cohesion Fund 8(CF), the European Agricultural Fund
for Rural Development and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF).
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: Greece has been affected by the consequences of the financial crisis in a unique manner. It has led to persistently negative
GDP growth rates in Greece over a number of years, which, in turn, has caused serious liquidity shortages and a lack of public funds available
for the public investment needed to foster a sustainable recovery. This has created an exceptional situation which needs to be addressed with
specific measures.
However, it is vital that the lack of liquidity and of public funds in Greece do not hinder investment under programmes supported by the
European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund (the Funds) and by the European Maritime and
Fisheries Fund (EMFF).
In its Communication entitled "A new start for Jobs and Growth in Greece", the Commission proposed measures to ensure that the available
EU funding from the Funds and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF), is effectively used for investments on the ground and
reaches beneficiaries as rapidly as possible.
CONTENT: as an exceptional measure and given the unique situation this has created in Greece, the Commission proposes to amend
Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 on the common provisions on the European Structural and European Investment Funds as follows:
in order to ensure that Greece has sufficient financial means to start the implementation of 2014-2020 programmes supported by the
Funds and the EMFF in 2015 and 2016, the Commission proposes to increase the level of the initial pre-financing paid to its
operational programmes under the Investment for Growth and Jobs Goal and to programmes supported by the EMFF through the
payment of an additional initial prefinancing amount in those years to give an immediate boost to investment;
in order to improve the effective use of available cohesion policy funding for the financing of operations under programmes adopted for
the 2007-2013 period, it proposes to increase the maximum co-financing rates and to raise the ceiling for payments to programmes at
the end of the programming period.
In concrete terms, it is proposed to amend Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 to allow for the ceiling for the cumulative total of pre-financing and
interim payments to be 100% and to increase the co-financing rate for 2007-2013 operational programmes for the Convergence and the
Regional competitiveness and employment objectives in Greece to 100%.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposed consists of frontloading payment appropriations and is budgetary neutral over the 2014-2020
period.
The additional payment appropriations necessary to cover the immediate consequence of an increase of 2007-2013 co-financing rates and
removal of the ceiling for payments are EUR 500 million in 2015 and EUR 500 million for the additional initial pre-financing in 2015.
These additional payment appropriations can potentially be covered by payment appropriations foreseen for interim payments for the
2014-2020 programmes depending on the progress of submission of interim payment applications in 2015.
The additional pre-financing of EUR 500 million for 2016 was however not foreseen in the draft budget 2016. Nor was the impact in 2016 of
the increase in the maximum co-financing rates and in the ceiling for payments for 2007-2013 programmes.
The Commission is therefore likely to propose to cover the additional payment needs through an amending letter to the 2016 draft . The
estimated impact on 2017 will be included in the next budgetary procedure.

2015/0160(COD) - 23/09/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Regional Development adopted the report by Iskra MIHAYLOVA (ADLE, BG) on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down
common provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, the Cohesion Fund, the European Agricultural
Fund for Rural Development and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund and laying down general provisions on the European Regional
Development Fund, the European Social Fund, the Cohesion Fund and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund as regards specific
measures for Greece.
The Committee recommended the European Parliament to adopt its position at first reading, taking over the Commission proposal.
The proposed amending Regulation is an exceptional measure, aimed at providing immediate support to Greece by enabling it to access and
use before the end of 2015 Union funding for cohesion policy still available from the 2007-2013 programming period. Therefore, Members
consider that its adoption is urgent.

2015/0160(COD) - 06/10/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 586 votes to 87, with 21 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down
common provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, the Cohesion Fund, the European Agricultural
Fund for Rural Development and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) and laying down general provisions on the European
Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, the Cohesion Fund and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund as regards
specific measures for Greece.
Parliament considered that the proposed amending Regulation is an exceptional measure, aimed at providing immediate support to Greece by
enabling it to access and use before the end of 2015 Union funding for cohesion policy still available from the 2007-2013 programming period,
and therefore its adoption is urgent.
The position adopted by the Parliament at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure provides the following:
in order to ensure that Greece has sufficient financial means to start the implementation of 2014-2020 programmes supported by the

Funds and the EMFF in 2015 and 2016, it is appropriate to increase the level of the initial pre-financing paid to its operational
programmes under the Investment for growth and jobs goal and to programmes supported by the EMFF through the payment of an
additional initial pre-financing amount of 3.5% of the amount of support from the Funds and the EMFF for the entire programming
period shall be paid to operational programmes in Greece each year in 2015 and 2016;
in order to improve the effective use of available funding for the financing of operations under operational programmes for the
Convergence and Regional competitiveness and employment objectives supported by the Funds which were adopted for the
2007-2013 period in Greece, the maximum co-financing rates should be increased and the ceiling for payments to programmes at the
end of the programming period raised.

2015/0160(COD) - 14/10/2015 Final act
PURPOSE: to assist Greece to optimise the use it makes of the European structural and investment funds and to improve the situation
regarding lack of liquidity in order to stimulate jobs and growth.
LEGISLATIVE ACT : Regulation (EU) 2015/1839 of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 as
regards specific measures for Greece.
CONTENT: Greece has been affected by the consequences of the financial crisis in a unique manner. The crisis has led to persistently
negative gross domestic product growth rates in Greece over a number of years, which, in turn, has caused serious liquidity shortages and a
lack of public funds available for the public investment needed to foster a sustainable recovery.
This amending Regulation is an exceptional measure, the aim of which is to provide a solution for the lack of liquidity and of public funds in
Greece for investment under programmes supported by the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund (ESF) and the
Cohesion Fund and by the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF).
Specifically, the amendments made to Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 aim to:
1) ensure that Greece has sufficient financial means to start the implementation of 2014-2020 programmes supported by the Funds and the
EMFF in 2015 and 2016: to this end, the Regulation increases the level of the initial pre-financing paid to its operational programmes under the
Investment for growth and jobs goal and to programmes supported by the EMFF through the payment of an additional initial pre-financing
amount of 3.5% of the amount of support from the Funds and the EMFF for the entire programming period to operational programmes in
Greece each year in 2015 and 2016.
The additional initial pre-financing shall not apply to programmes under the European territorial cooperation goal nor to the specific allocation
for the Youth Employment Initiative.
To ensure that the additional initial pre-financing amount is effectively used, the additional initial pre-financing amount should be repaid to the
Commission if it is not followed by an adequate level of payment applications submitted to the Commission within a certain deadline;
2) improve the effective use of available funding under cohesion policy for the financing of operations under operational programmes for the
Convergence and Regional competitiveness and employment objectives supported by the Funds which were adopted for the 2007-2013
period in Greece: for this purpose, the Regulation sets out a maximum EU co-financing rate of 100 % to the eligible expenditure indicated for
Greek operational programmes for the Convergence and Regional competitiveness and employment objectives
ENTRY INTO FORCE : 16.10.2015.
