OJ L 336 23.12.2015, p. 0027 Summary

2015/0036(NLE) - 02/03/2015 Initial legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude, on behalf of the European Union, the Exchange of Letters to obtain membership of the Extended Commission of the
Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) is a Regional Fisheries Management Organisation
(RFMO) responsible for the management of Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBF) throughout its distribution. The Convention for the Conservation of
Southern Bluefin tuna entered into force on 20 May 1994.
The European Union has been a Cooperating Non-Member of the CCSBT Extended Commission since 2006. Cooperating Non-Members
participate fully in the activities of the CCSBT but are not entitled to vote.
On 1 December 2009, the Council authorised the European Commission to seek, on behalf of the European Union, an amendment to the rules
of Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna in order for the European Union to become a Contracting Party.
During its 20th meeting in October 2013, the CCSBT amended the Resolution governing the Extended Commission to allow the European
Union to become a Member of the CCSBT Extended Commission through Exchange of Letters.
Since vessels flying the flags of Member States of the Union fish resources in the area of distribution of Southern Bluefin Tuna, it is in the
Union's interest to play an effective role in the implementation of the Convention.
CONTENT: this proposal seeks to conclude the legal process launched with the signature and provisional application of the Exchange of
Letters to obtain membership of the CCSBT Extended Commission and Extended Scientific Committee after having obtained the consent from
the European Parliament.
Upon completion of this procedure, the EU would be entitled to membership and vote in the CCSBT Extended Commission and Extended

Scientific Committee.

2015/0036(NLE) - 10/04/2015 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude, on behalf of the European Union, the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Union
and the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) concerning the membership of the Union in the Extended
Commission of the Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: the Union is competent to adopt measures for the conservation of marine biological resources under the common fisheries
policy and to enter into agreements with third countries and international organisations.
On 1 December 2009, the Council authorised the European Commission to seek, on behalf of the Union, an amendment to the Convention for
the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna in order for the Union to become a Contracting Party.
During its 20th meeting in October 2013, the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna amended the Resolution to establish
an Extended Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT Extended Commission) to allow the Union to become a
Member of the CCSBT Extended Commission through an Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters.
On 20 April 2015, the Council authorised the signature and provisional application of the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters
between the European Union and the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) concerning the membership of the
Union in the Extended Commission of the Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna.
CONTENT: under this proposal, the Council is invited to approve, on behalf of the Union, the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters
between the European Union and the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) concerning the membership of the
Union in the Extended Commission of the Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna .
Since vessels flying the flags of Member States of the Union fish resources in the area of distribution of Southern Bluefin Tuna, it is in the
Union's interest to play an effective role in the implementation of the Convention.
Membership of the CCSBT Extended Commission will also promote consistency in the Union's conservation approach across oceans and
reinforce its commitment to the long-term conservation and sustainable use of fisheries resources globally.

2015/0036(NLE) - 10/11/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Fisheries adopted the report by Carlos ITURGAIZ (EPP, ES) on the draft Council decision on the conclusion, on behalf of
the European Union, of the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Union and the Commission for the
Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) concerning the membership of the Union in the Extended Commission of the Convention for
the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna.
The committee recommended the European Parliament to give its consent to the conclusion of the Agreement.
To recall, the proposal concerns authorisation of the Exchange of Letters between the EU and the Extended Commission of the Convention for
the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, (CCSBT). The signing of this instrument of international law will allow the EU to become a full
member of the CCSBT Extended Commission, having enjoyed cooperating non-member status since 2006.
The Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) is a Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (RFMO)
responsible for the management of Southern Bluefin Tuna wherever it is to be found. The Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin
Tuna entered into force on 20 May 1994.

2015/0036(NLE) - 24/11/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 627 votes to 33, with 27 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the draft Council decision on the
conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Union and the
Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) concerning the membership of the Union in the Extended Commission of
the Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna.
In line with the recommendation by the Committee on Fisheries, the European Parliament gave its consent to the conclusion of the Agreement.

PURPOSE: to conclude the Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Union and the Commission for the
Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) concerning membership in the Extended Commission of the Convention for the Conservation
of Southern Bluefin Tuna.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Council Decision (EU) 2015/2437 on the conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Agreement in the form
of an Exchange of Letters between the European Union and the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT)

CONTENT: by this Decision, the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Union and the Commission for the
Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) concerning the membership of the Union in the Extended Commission of the Convention for

To recall, on 1 December 2009 the Council authorised the European Commission to seek, on behalf of the Union, an amendment to the
Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna in order for the Union to become a Contracting Party.
While the negotiations on the amendment to the Convention have not been conclusive, during its 20th meeting in October 2013, the CCSBT
amended the Resolution to establish an Extended Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna to allow the Union to become a
member of the CCSBT Extended Commission through an Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters.
On 20 April 2015 the Council authorised the signature and provisional application of the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters
between the EU and the CCSBT concerning the membership of the Union in the CCSBT Extended Commission.
Since vessels flying the flags of Member States of the Union fish resources in the area of distribution of Southern Bluefin Tuna, it is in the
Union's interest to play an effective role in the implementation of the Convention.
Membership of the CCSBT Extended Commission will also promote consistency in the Union's conservation approach across oceans and
reinforce its commitment to the long-term conservation and sustainable use of fisheries resources globally.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 14.12.2015.
