OJ L 052 27.02.2016, p. 0013 Summary

2015/0058(NLE) - 05/03/2015 Initial legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude the Agreement between the European Union and Timor-Leste on the short-stay visa waiver.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council amended Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing
the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders of the Member States and those whose
nationals are exempt from that requirement. The Regulation was adopted on 20 May 2014 and entered into force on 9 June 2014.
In July 2014, the Commission presented a Recommendation to the Council to authorise it to start negotiations on visa waiver agreements with
each of the following 17 countries: Dominica, Grenada, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the
Grenadines, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, the United Arab Emirates and Vanuatu. On 9
October 2014, the Council addressed negotiating directives to the Commission. The negotiations on the visa waiver agreement with
Timor-Leste were opened on 19 November 2014 in Brussels. The agreement was initialled by the chief negotiators on 15 December 2014 .
The Commission considers that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives were attained and that the draft visa waiver
agreement is acceptable to the Union.
CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve the Agreement between the European Union andTimor-Leste on the
short-stay visa waiver.

The content of the agreement may be summarised as follows:
Purpose and duration of stay: the agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of
Timor-Leste when travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period.
The agreement takes into account the situation of the Member States that do not yet apply the Schengen acquis in full. As long as they are not
part of the Schengen area without internal borders, the visa waiver confers a right for the nationals of Timor Leste to stay for 90 days in any
180-day on the territory of each of those Member States (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania), independently of the period calculated for
the whole Schengen area.
A provision has been included in the agreement stating that Timor-Leste may suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all the
Member States of the European Union and that the Union may also only suspend or terminate the agreement in respect of all of its Member
States.
Scope: the visa waiver covers all categories of persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all
kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. For this latter category, each Member State and also Timor-Leste
remain free to impose the visa requirement on the citizens of the other Party in accordance with the applicable Union or national law.
The Member States and Timor-Leste reserve the right to refuse entry into and short stay in their territories if one or more of these conditions
are not met.
Territorial application: in the case of France and the Netherlands, the visa waiver would entitle nationals of Timor-Leste to stay only in those
Member States? European territories.
The provisions of the Agreement do not apply to the United Kingdom and Ireland.
The Agreement establishes a Joint Committee for the management of the Agreement, which shall adopt its rules of procedure.

2015/0058(NLE) - 28/04/2015 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude the Agreement between the European Union and Timor-Leste on the short-stay visa waiver.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: the Commission negotiated on behalf of the European Union an agreement with Timor-Leste on the short-stay visa waiver.
In accordance with a Council Decision, the Agreement has been signed and is applied on a provisional basis.
It is now necessary to approve the Agreement on behalf of the EU.
CONTENT: the Council is invited to approve the Agreement between the European Union and Timor-Leste on the short-stay visa waiver.
For further details of the Agreement, please refer to the summary of the initial Commission proposal dated 5.3.2015 .
Territorial provisions: the provisions of the future Agreement shall not apply to the United Kingdom and Ireland.
The Agreement sets up a Joint Committee of experts for the management of the Agreement. The Union is to be represented within that Joint
Committee by the Commission, which should be assisted by the representatives of the Member States.

2015/0058(NLE) - 16/11/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs adopted the report by Mariya GABRIEL (EPP, BG) on the draft Council decision on
the conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Agreement between the European Union and the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste
on the short-stay visa waiver.
The committee recommended the European Parliament to give its consent to the conclusion of the Agreement.
To recall, the Agreement signed on 26 May 2015 provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of
Timor-Leste when travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period. The visa
waiver covers all categories of persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all kinds of purposes,
except for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity.
The report is accompanied by a short justification stating that this agreement on the waiver of short-stay visas simultaneously represents a
culmination of the deepening of relations between the European Union and the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste which is politically highly
significant in the context of the Cotonou Agreement and is an additional way of stepping up economic and cultural relations and intensifying
political dialogue on various issues, including human rights and fundamental freedoms.
In the economic sphere, the agreement represents an opportunity to intensify economic relations and develop tourism. Tourism in
particular is a key sector for the development of Timor-Leste, which may attract European citizens both as tourists and as investors.
The EU currently ranks third among the trade partners of the Pacific countries, behind Australia and China. Despite that, the EU
remains in sixth place in the league table of exporters to TimorLeste. The visa waiver is therefore an additional incentive for European
entrepreneurs and investors.
As regards the political situation, this agreement serves to enhance the position of the European Union as a partner of the countries in
the Pacific region and with a view to the accession of Timor-Leste to ASEAN, with which the Union has announced the intention of
stepping up its strategic partnership. The political dialogue between the European Union and Timor-Leste on this subject is concerned
with human rights, freedom of the press and gender equality, particularly combating domestic violence.

As regards mobility, the vast majority of Schengen visa applicants are regarded as travelling in good faith and not as presenting any
risks, and they are therefore granted short-stay visas.
As regards the implementation and monitoring of the agreement, the rapporteur:
called on the Commission to observe any developments in relation to the criteria regarding clandestine immigration, public policy and
security, including, considerations relating to human rights and fundamental freedoms;
urged the Commission and the authorities of Timor-Leste to ensure full reciprocity of the visa waiver, which should permit equal
treatment of all citizens, particularly all citizens of the Union;
encouraged the Commission to review the composition of the joint management committees for future agreements to enable the
European Parliament to be involved in the work of these committees.
Lastly, the rapporteur also queried the practice of signing visa waiver agreements and applying them provisionally before the European
Parliament has approved them, a practice which is liable to reduce Parliaments room for manoeuvre.

2015/0058(NLE) - 15/12/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 581 votes to 66, with 23 abstentions, legislative resolution on the draft Council decision on the
conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Agreement between the European Union and the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste on
the short-stay visa waiver.
In line with the recommendation by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, Parliament gave its consent to the conclusion
of the agreement.
The Agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of Timor-Leste when travelling to the
territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period . The visa waiver covers all categories of
persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of
carrying out a paid activity.

2015/0058(NLE) - 12/02/2016 Final act
PURPOSE: to conclude the Agreement between the European Union and Timor-Leste on the short-stay visa waiver.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Council Decision (EU) 2016/273 on the conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Agreement between the
European Union and the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste on the short-stay visa waiver.
CONTENT: under this Decision, the Agreement between the European Union and Timor-Leste on the short-stay visa waiver is approved on
behalf of the Union.
To recall, the Commission negotiated on behalf of the European Union an agreement with Timor-Leste on the short-stay visa waiver. The
Agreement has been signed and is applied on a provisional basis as from 28 May 2015.
The Agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of Timor-Leste when travelling to the
territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period. A joint statement on the interpretation of this
duration of 90 days is annexed to the Agreement.
The visa waiver covers all categories of persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all kinds of
purposes, except for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. For this latter category, each Member State and also Timor-Leste remain free
to impose the visa requirement on the citizens of the other Party in accordance with the applicable Union or national law.
The Member States and Timor-Leste reserve the right to refuse entry into and short stay in their territories if one or more of these conditions
are not met.
The Agreement sets up a Joint Committee of experts for the management of the Agreement. The Union is to be represented within that Joint
Committee by the Commission, which should be assisted by the representatives of the Member States.
This Decision constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in which Ireland and the United Kingdom do not take part.
Therefore, these two countries are not bound by it or subject to its application.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 12.2.2016.
