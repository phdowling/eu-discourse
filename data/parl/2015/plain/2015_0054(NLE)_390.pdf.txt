2015/0054(NLE) - 05/03/2015 Initial legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude the Agreement between the European Union and Trinidad and Tobago on the short-stay visa waiver.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council amended Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing
the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders of the Member States and those whose
nationals are exempt from that requirement.
The Regulation was adopted on 20 May 2014 and entered into force on 9 June 2014.
In July 2014, the Commission presented a Recommendation to the Council to authorise it to start negotiations on visa waiver agreements with
each of the following 17 countries: Dominica, Grenada, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the
Grenadines, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, the United Arab Emirates and Vanuatu. On 9
October 2014, the Council addressed negotiating directives to the Commission.

The negotiations on the visa waiver agreement with Trinidad and Tobago and the four other Caribbean countries were opened on 12
November 2014 in Brussels. The agreement was initialled by the chief negotiators on 15 December 2014. The Commission considers that the
objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives were attained and that the draft visa waiver agreement is acceptable to the Union.
CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve the Agreement between the European Union and Trinidad and Tobago on the
short-stay visa waiver.
The content of the agreement may be summarised as follows:
Purpose and duration of stay: the agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of Trinidad
and Tobago when travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period . The
agreement takes into account the situation of the Member States that do not yet apply the Schengen acquis in full. As long as they are not part
of the Schengen area without internal borders, the visa waiver confers a right for the nationals of Trinidad and Tobago to stay for 90 days in
any 180-day on the territory of each of those Member States (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania), independently of the period calculated
for the whole Schengen area.
A provision has been included in the agreement stating that Trinidad and Tobago may suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of
all the Member States of the European Union and that the Union may also only suspend or terminate the agreement in respect of all of its
Member States.
Scope: the visa waiver covers all categories of persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all
kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. For this latter category, each Member State and also Trinidad and
Tobago remain free to impose the visa requirement on the citizens of the other Party in accordance with the applicable Union or national law.
The Member States and Trinidad and Tobago reserve the right to refuse entry into and short stay in their territories if one or more of these
conditions are not met.
Territorial application: in the case of France and the Netherlands, the visa waiver would entitle nationals of Trinidad and Tobago to stay only in
those Member States? European territories.
The provisions of the Agreement do not apply to the United Kingdom and Ireland.
The Agreement establishes a Joint Committee for the management of the Agreement, which shall adopt its rules of procedure.

2015/0054(NLE) - 28/04/2015 Legislative proposal

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: the Commission negotiated on behalf of the European Union an agreement with the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago on the
short-stay visa waiver.
In accordance with a Council Decision, the Agreement has been signed and is applied on a provisional basis.
It is now necessary to approve the Agreement on behalf of the EU.
CONTENT: the Council is invited to approve the Agreement between the European Union and Trinidad and Tobago on the short-stay visa
waiver.
For further details of the Agreement, please refer to the summary of the initial legislative proposal dated 5.3.2015 .

The Agreement sets up a Joint Committee of experts for the management of the Agreement. The Union is to be represented within that Joint
Committee by the Commission, which should be assisted by the representatives of the Member States.

2015/0054(NLE) - 16/11/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs adopted the report by Mariya GABRIEL (EPP, BG) on the draft Council decision on
the conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago on
the short-stay visa waiver.
The committee recommended the European Parliament to give its consent to the conclusion of the Agreement.
To recall, the Agreement signed on 28 May 2015 provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of
Trinidad and Tobago when travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period. The
visa waiver covers all categories of persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all kinds of
purposes, except for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity.
The report is accompanied by a short justification stating that this agreement on the waiver of short-stay visas simultaneously represents a
culmination of the deepening of relations between the European Union and the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago which is politically highly
significant in the context of the Cotonou Agreement and is an additional way of stepping up economic and cultural relations and intensifying
political dialogue on various issues, including human rights and fundamental freedoms.
In the economic sphere, the EU is ranked second among the trading partners of Trinidad and Tobago. Trinidad and Tobago has one
of the most dynamic and prosperous economies in CARICOM, because of the oil and gas resources, the high levels of direct

investment and growing tourism. It seeking to promote a diversified and competitive economy based on technology, innovation and
growth. The visa waiver will simplify conditions for travel by businesspeople and will facilitate investment.
As regards the political and institutional situation, civil and political rights are guaranteed by the Constitution and respected in the
country. Trinidad and Tobago is a stable, democratic country, which, like the European Union, defends the values and principles of
democracy, good governance and respect for human rights and the rule of law. This agreement will make it possible to cooperate in
such fundamental fields as human rights and to pursue a balanced, regular, in-depth political dialogue on more specific issues such as
abolition of the death penalty or promoting the rights of women and children. These two issues remain the Unions priorities.
As regards mobility, the visa refusal rate in 2014 being around 0.3%. Trinidad and Tobago is therefore a country which does not
present the slightest risk of clandestine immigration into the EU or irregular migration or any threat to security and public policy.
As regards the implementation and monitoring of the agreement, the rapporteur:
called on the Commission to observe any developments in relation to the criteria regarding clandestine immigration, public policy and
security, including, considerations relating to human rights and fundamental freedoms;
urged the Commission and the authorities of Trinidad and Tobago to ensure full reciprocity of the visa waiver, which should permit
equal treatment of all citizens, particularly all citizens of the Union;
encouraged the Commission to review the composition of the joint management committees for future agreements to enable the
European Parliament to be involved in the work of these committees.
Lastly, the rapporteur also queried the practice of signing visa waiver agreements and applying them provisionally before the European
Parliament has approved them, a practice which is liable to reduce Parliaments room for manoeuvre.
