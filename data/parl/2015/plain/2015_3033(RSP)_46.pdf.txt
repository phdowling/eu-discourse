Summary

2015/3033(RSP) - 20/01/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a resolution in support of the peace process in Colombia.
The text adopted in plenary was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ECR, ALDE, GUE/NGL, Greens/EFA and EFDD groups.
Parliament recalled that EU and Colombia maintain a framework of close political, economic and trade cooperation established in the
Memorandum of Understanding of November 2009 and the Trade Agreement between Colombia and Peru and the EU and its Member States.
Parliament noted that the platform for talks between the Colombian Government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC)
was established in Havana (Cuba) in 2012 fulfilled the wish of the entire people of Colombia to live in peace. It took note of the agreements
made to date between the Government of Colombia and the FARC to achieve peace in Colombia and support them. It also highlighted the
agreements on a comprehensive rural reform, political participation and democratic opening to build peace, solving the problem of illicit drugs
and the establishing a Special Jurisdiction for Peace.
Peace in Colombia: Members called on the National Liberation Army (ELN) to commit firmly and decisively, without further delay, to peace in
Colombia and urged it to enter into concomitant negotiations with the Colombian Government, to be organised along the same lines. They
wished to see the negotiations conclude as soon as possible so as to put a permanent end to the conflict and. All of Colombias political forces
and the whole of its society should make a positive contribution to ending violence.
Parliament welcomed the decision of 1 October 2015 of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security
Policy/Vice-President of the Commission, Federica Mogherini, to appoint Eamon Gilmore, former Deputy Prime Minister and former Minister
for Foreign Affairs and Trade of Ireland, as the European Unions Special Envoy for the Peace Process in Colombia. It reiterated its readiness
to provide all possible assistance to support the implementation of the final peace agreement, and to this end renewed its call on European
Union Member States to create a trust fund to accompany the post-conflict phase.
Fighting inequalities: Members stressed how important it is for the peace process to be accompanied by a determined effort to combat
inequality and poverty, including by finding fair solutions for people and communities forced off their lands, and providing all of Colombia's
people with access to decent work and ensuring recognition of their social and labour rights. They noted with satisfaction that the exclusion of
crimes against humanity, genocide, serious war crimes and human rights violations from any amnesty or pardon is in line with international
criminal and humanitarian law and international instruments and standards in the field of human rights. They considered it essential that the
sentences passed on perpetrators of crimes play their part in victim reparations and social and political reconciliation.
Combatting violence: Members recognised the efforts made by Colombias institutions to make progress in ensuring that human rights are fully
and permanently upheld and called on them to redouble their efforts with a view to fully eradicating the subculture of violence from a country in
which 50 years of conflict have on occasion led to extra-legal responses and behaviour contrary to human rights and the rule of law in some
state institutions.
Members also welcomed the recent announcement by the FARC that they will suspend military training in order to concentrate henceforth on
political and cultural training as part of the process of bringing the armed conflict to an end constitutes another encouraging step in the right
direction.
Lastly, Members recommended that its Delegation for relations with the countries of the Andean Community and its Delegation to the
Euro-Latin American Parliamentary Assembly monitor and, potentially, accompany the peace accords.
