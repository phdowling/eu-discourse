2015/2132(BUD) - 24/06/2015 Commission draft budget
PURPOSE: presentation of the Commission Draft Budget (DB) for 2016 (all section).
BACKGROUND: the draft budget (DB) 2016 is the first EU budget prepared in light of the political guidelines established by Commission
President Juncker providing a new start for Europe based on his agenda for Jobs, Growth, Fairness and Democratic change.
The key priority for the 2016 DB is to provide a new boost for jobs, growth and investment. In particular, through the proposed creation of the
European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI), the Commission proposes to maximize the use of the EU budget in order to respond to the
slower pace of investments.
The EU budget is targeted to the promotion of fairness, positioning the Union as a stronger global actor and moving towards a new policy on
migration.
The 2016 DB aims to provide solidarity between Member States and regions through the European Structural and Investment Funds, and help
young people to be trained and find jobs using the Youth Employment Initiative. Moreover, the 2016 DB intends to respond to new
developments in Europe's neighbourhood (e.g. Ukraine in the East and Syria in the Mediterranean) and the wider world, facing growing
migratory pressures in the Southern Mediterranean.
Sound administrative management is maintained in the 2016 DB: the Commission will continue exercising administrative restraint, for instance
by reducing its own staff numbers by 1 % for the fourth year in a row. What is new in the 2016 DB is that EU funded policies and actions can
finally be fully implemented on the ground once the new legal bases are in place and operational programmes are adopted. Moreover, in 2016
the Commission expects to deal with the backlog of unpaid bills from the past programming period and to be able to make all payments due in
the year.
CONTENT: the 2016 draft budget proposed by the Juncker Commission reflects its 10 political priorities defined when it took office. These
priorities are pursued within broadly stable annual ceilings under the 2014-2020 MFF and with a renewed emphasis on results to maximise the
outcome of the use of scarce resources.
The budget in figures: the 2016 DB is presented as follows:
in terms of commitment appropriations, the total expenditure in the draft budget (DB) 2016 (including the special instruments) is EUR
153 529.5 million, corresponding to 1.04% of GNI, that is EUR 8 413.3 million below the total expenditure in 2015 ( 5.2%);
the payment appropriations (including the special instruments) amount to EUR 143 541.5 million, corresponding to 0.98% of GNI. This
represents a moderate increase of 1.6% over the level of payment appropriations in the 2015 budget.
Overall, the proposed level of expenditure for 2016 reflects the expenditure ceilings under the multiannual financial framework, while the
amounts for the individual programmes broadly reflect the financial programming for 2016.
However, three major new elements in the draft budget concern: the proposed creation of the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI)
under heading 1a. In addition to redeployment from existing EU funding, the Commission proposes to complete its financing for 2016 by
making use of the Global Margin for Commitments, for an amount of EUR 351.4 million; (ii) the proposed mobilisation of the Flexibility
Instrument to provide additional funding under heading 3 for temporary measures in the area of asylum in Italy and Greece (EUR 150 million);
(iii) the proposed reinforcement of operational programmes and decentralised agencies under heading 3 amounting to EUR 123.2 million in
commitment appropriations to respond to migratory pressures in 2016.
The main budgetary priorities of 2016:
-

boosting jobs, growth and investments: continued emphasis on innovation and investment is necessary to create more jobs for
Europeans and strengthen growth potential. The European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) will support strategic investments
of European significance in infrastructure, notably broadband and energy networks, as well as transport infrastructure, particularly in
industrial centres; education, research and innovation; and renewable energy and energy efficiency;

-

responding to new developments: the 2016 draft budget responds also to the most immediate developments, including crises in
neighbourhood countries such as Ukraine and Syria and the related impact on migration, humanitarian aid, security, and the need to
make progress towards a new Energy Union with a forward-looking climate change policy as stated in the policy priorities of the new
Commission. As regards migration, the draft budget provides additional funding for temporary measures in the area of asylum in Italy
and Greece (EUR 150 million) through the proposed mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument, to help relieve the immediate and
exceptional pressure on their asylum and migration systems establishing for a duration of 24 months a temporary relocation
mechanism of applicants who are in clear need of international protection from Italy and Greece to the other Member States;

-

addressing payment needs: implementation of EU policies was hampered by severe constraints in the level of authorised payment
appropriations, leading to recurrent amending budgets to cover part of the outstanding needs. The fall in the 2014 payment ceiling
led the Commission to propose the mobilisation of the Contingency Margin for payments, which was eventually agreed by Council
and Parliament. Despite such a corrective measure, the backlog of outstanding payment claims for the Cohesion policy (heading 1b)
reached an unprecedented peak of EUR 24.7 billion at the end of 2014. In order to face this challenge, measures were put in place
to ensure an active management of the scarce payment appropriations. The increasing payment ceiling in 2016 (+ 1.9% compared
to 2015), combined with the effect of the later than originally planned take off of new programmes under shared management with
Member States, creates the necessary room for the payment appropriations which are estimated to be required to phase out the
abnormal backlog of outstanding payment claims. As a net result, the level of payment appropriations estimated in the 2016 draft
budget (EUR 143.2 billion) represents a moderate increase (+ 1.6%) over the 2015 budget.

-

showing administrative restraint: for the fourth consecutive year, the Commission will reduce by 1% its staff levels in 2016, in order
to meet the 5% staff reduction over five years which applies to all EU institutions and bodies. It will further reduce its staff level in
accordance with the delegation of certain implementing tasks to executive agencies.

KEY BUDGETARY ASPECTS OF THE HEADINGS: the analysis is structured under the 2014-2020 financial framework headings:
Heading 1: Smart and inclusive growth: this heading is broken down into 2 sub-headings:

-

Heading 1a: Competitiveness for growth and jobs: commitment appropriations for this heading are set at EUR 18 618.4 million. This
is an increase of 6.1% compared to the 2015 budget, which is mostly due to the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI),
the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) and Erasmus+. This leaves a margin of EUR 200 million, after making use of the Global
Margin for Commitments for an amount of EUR 351.4 million in 2016. Payment appropriations increase by 11.4% to EUR 17 518.1
million, in order to address the growing level of outstanding commitments and to ensure the implementation of the new programmes;

-

Heading 1b: Economic, social and territorial cohesion: commitment appropriations decrease by 15.9% to EUR 50 821.7 million,
leaving a margin of EUR 15.3 million. Payment appropriations for the heading as a whole decrease by 4% compared to the 2015
budget, to EUR 49 060.1 million. This reflects the gradual phasing out of payment needs for 2007-2013 programmes, while the
2014-2020 programmes are on their way to progressively reach cruising speed.

Heading 2: Sustainable growth: natural resources: commitment appropriations of EUR 63 104.4 million are proposed for heading 2. This level
of expenditure represents a slight reduction compared to the 2015 budget ( 1.2%) and leaves a margin of EUR 1 157.6 million under the
ceiling. Payment appropriations amount to EUR 55 865.9 million, with a decrease of 0.2% compared to 2015. The funding for market related
expenditure and direct payments reaches EUR 42 867.6 million in commitment appropriations, and EUR 42 859.3 million in payment
appropriations. A margin under the sub-ceiling for market measures and direct payments amounting to EUR 1 081.7 million is left. Payment
appropriations for rural development increase by 6.3% compared to the 2015 budget;
Heading 3: Security and citizenship: this heading sees an increase in commitment appropriations of 9.7% to EUR 2.67 million, leaving a
margin of EUR 124 million. This is due to the proposed mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument to provide additional funding for temporary
measures in the area of asylum in Italy and Greece (EUR 150 million). Payment appropriations increase by 17.1% to EUR 2 259 million, which
is due to the payment appropriations related to the reinforced migration measures, as well as to the growing payment needs of the Asylum,
Migration and Integration Fund and the Internal Security Fund in general.
Heading 4: Global Europe: this heading sees an increase in commitment appropriations of 5.6% to EUR 8 881.7 million, leaving an
unallocated margin of EUR 261.3 million available under the ceiling. Payment appropriations increase by 28.5% to EUR 9 539.2 million, mostly
to take account of the rapidly growing level of outstanding commitments under this heading.
Heading 5: Administration (expenditure for all institutions and staff): commitment and payment appropriations for Administration (heading 5) for
all institutions combined including pensions and European schools increase by 2.9%, with commitments set at EUR 8 909 million.
Administrative expenditure of all institutions (+ 2.2%) is above the forecast inflation in Brussels (+ 1.3%) and Luxembourg (+ 1.9%) and reflects
additional security expenditure in the European Parliament, increased EEAS expenditure in delegations in third countries because of a
deteriorating exchange rate and the opening of two new delegations, the budgetary impact of the foreseen reform of the Court of Justice and
additional administrative expenditure related to Commission staff relocation from the JMO building in Luxembourg. The requested expenditure
for the institutions leaves a margin of EUR 582.9 million under the sub-ceiling for administrative expenditure of the institutions (excluding
pensions and European schools).
The 5.2% increase for pensions results from the annual adjustments for 2015 (+ 1.2%) and 2016 (+1.8% on a six month basis), combined with
the expected growth (by 3.8%) in the number of staff expected to retire in 2016. Expenditure for the European schools takes into account the
steep increase in the number of pupils in the European schools in Frankfurt and Luxembourg. Taking into account the estimated expenditure
for pensions and European schools, the global margin under the ceiling of heading 5 amounts to EUR 574.3 million.

2015/2132(BUD) - 26/06/2015 Document attached to the procedure
PURPOSE: presentation of amending letter No 1 to the draft general budget 2016 on the financing of the EFSI guarantee fund.
CONTENT: this Amending Letter No 1 (AL1) to the draft budget for the year 2016 reflects the budgetary impact of the political agreement on
the financing of the EFSI Guarantee Fund reached between the European Parliament and the Council on 28 May 2015, which facilitated the
adoption of the Regulation on the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) on 24 June 2015.
The adoption of the EFSI basic act means that the corresponding appropriations for the provisioning of the Guarantee Fund and the funding of
the European Investment Advisory Hub (EIAH) and European Investment Project Portal (IPP) can be transferred from the reserve to the
operational lines.
In addition, the Commission proposes to complete the budget structure for the EFSI by creating a new budget article 01 04 07, with a token
entry (p.m.), in view of a possible contribution from the EU budget to supplement the fees covering the work carried out by the European
Investment Fund (EIF) in the implementation of the new financial instruments under the EFSI.
Overall, the political agreement reduced by EUR 1 billion the redeployment of commitment appropriations from the Horizon 2020 and
Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) programmes as initially proposed by the Commission as part of its legislative proposal for the creation of the
EFSI, to be compensated by a corresponding increase in the use of the unallocated margin under heading 1a and the Global Margin for
Commitments. As part of the political agreement, the Commission stated that it would analyse the potential impact of the contributions to the
EFSI from the different budget lines of Horizon 2020 on the effective implementation of the respective programmes.
Consequently, in this Amending Letter the Commission proposes to reduce the 2016 redeployment from a number of budget lines under
Horizon 2020 and the Connecting Europe Facility. This leads to an increase of the commitment appropriations for Horizon 2020 by an amount
of EUR 153 million and an increase of the commitment appropriations for the Connecting Europe Facility (transport) by an amount of EUR 150
million.
This will be offset by a corresponding increase in the use of the available margins for the provisioning of the EFSI Guarantee Fund:
a decrease of the 2016 unallocated margin under heading 1a by EUR 111.4 million;
an increase in the use of the Global Margin for Commitments by EUR 191.6 million.
The net impact of these changes is an increase of EUR 303 million in commitment appropriations compared to the draft budget 2016 . The
overall level of payments remains unchanged.

2015/2132(BUD) - 04/09/2015 Council position on draft budget
On 4 September 2015, the Council adopted its position on the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2016.
Following the discussions in Council, the main features of this position may be summarised as follows:
EUR 153 268.84 million in commitment appropriations;
EUR 142 119.62 million in payment appropriations.
Under the Council's position, commitment appropriations decrease by 5.36% compared to the 2015 budget and payment appropriations
increase by 0.59%.
The total amount of payment appropriations provided for in the Council's position on the DB for 2016 corresponds to 0.97% of the EU gross
national income (GNI).
A. Principles: when adopting its position on the DB for 2016, the Council took into account the following principles:
to work within the framework of the budget guidelines established for the 2016 budget in the Council conclusions adopted in February
2015 (5310/2015);
to follow an approach leading to a budget complying with budgetary discipline and sound financial management, as well as taking duly
into account the ongoing economic and budgetary constraints in Member States;
to provide adequate funding for the European Union's various priorities, determining appropriations on the basis of past and current
budget implementation and realistic absorption capacities;
to foresee the appropriations necessary to respect the agreement reached on a payment plan for 2015-2016;
to comply with the agreement reached on the financing of the European Fund for Strategic Investments as far as the budget for 2016
is concerned;
to provide the appropriations necessary to implement the European Council conclusions of April and June 2015 on measures in the
area of migration;
to foresee the necessary appropriations enabling the smooth implementation of the new programmes in the third year of the MFF
2014-2020;
to leave adequate margins under the ceilings of the headings and subheadings of the MFF, with the exception of sub-heading 1b and
heading 3, in order to be able to cope with unforeseen situations;
to keep payment appropriations firmly under control in all headings and sub-headings of the MFF and to create a sufficient margin to
cover unforeseen events, resulting in a reduction in payment appropriations in particular under (sub-)headings 1a, 1b, 2 and 4.
Administrative expenditure: as regards administrative expenditure of the institutions, the Council recalls the importance of limiting the increase
in 2016 and of reducing staff in line with the -5 % target over the period 2013-2017 set in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 2 December 2013
on budgetary discipline.
In this context, the administrative budgets of the institutions were examined on the following basis:
to keep under strict control the volume of administrative expenditure of the institutions, in line with the approach followed by the
Member States for their national civil services;
to set the administrative budget of each institution at the appropriate level, taking into account their specificities and real and justified
needs;
to carry out targeted reductions and increase the flat rate abatement on salaries for some institutions and offices, taking into account
their past and current budget implementation and vacancy rates;
to apply the Commission's proposal to reduce staff by 1% per year as from 2013.
Decentralised agencies: as regards decentralised agencies, the Council reduced the overall level of contributions from the Union budget by
EUR 5.1 million in commitment appropriations and by EUR 5.3 million in payment appropriations. Agencies at cruising speed for which
contributions from the Union budget would have increased in comparison to their respective 2015 budgets were affected by those reductions.
The Council took note of the Commission's monitoring of the progress towards the 5% staff reduction target already achieved to date by a
number of institutions, bodies and agencies. It called on all institutions and bodies to continue implementing the remaining staff reduction until
the end of the five year period 2013-2017.
Declaration on payment appropriations: he Council approved the following statement on payment appropriations: "The Council will carefully
examine the letter of amendment for agriculture (including information on assigned revenue) in order to appropriately assess the level of
resources under heading 2 (Sustainable growth: natural resources) in the 2016 budget. In line with the joint statement on a payment plan
2015-2016, the Council calls on the Commission to continue closely scrutinizing the implementation of the 2014-2020 programmes. To that
end, it invites the Commission to present in a timely manner updated figures concerning the state of affairs and estimates regarding 2016
payment appropriations with a view to allowing the budgetary authority to take any necessary decisions in due time for justified needs."
B. Expenditure by main budget headings:
Heading 1: Smart and inclusive growth: EUR 69 559 million in commitments:
1a) Competitiveness for growth and jobs: the amount is set at EUR 18 781 million in commitments, an increase of 7% compared to 2015.

expenditure lines, on operational lines under the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural
Development, the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund and the Programme for Environment and Climate Action (LIFE);
reduce the appropriations requested in the DB for 2016 by a total amount of EUR 251.1 million, of which EUR 198.9 million in the
European Agricultural Guarantee Fund, EUR 45.6 million in the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, EUR 4.5 million in
the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, and EUR 2.1 million in the LIFE programme. These amounts, estimated on the basis of
information currently available, may be reviewed in the light of the letter of amendment on agriculture expected in the autumn. The

2016 on a number of budget lines concerning administrative support expenditure (EUR 200 000) and operational expenditure for new
programmes (EUR 32.3 million);
the amounts mentioned above also take into account reductions in contributions to decentralised agencies of EUR 1.1 million in
commitment and payment appropriations under this heading.
The margin under heading 3 is equal to zero and is left unchanged. Therefore, the Flexibility Instrument is mobilised for an amount of EUR

the DB for 2016 on a number of specific budget lines;
set the level of payment appropriations, reducing the appropriations requested in the DB for 2016 by a total amount of EUR 450.4
million, of which:
EUR 119.1 million in the Instrument for Pre-accession assistance,
EUR 100.3 million in the European Neighbourhood Instrument,
EUR 143.0 million in the Development Cooperation Instrument,
EUR 11.0 million in the Partnership instrument for cooperation with third countries,
EUR 25.1 million in the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights,
EUR 44.1 million in the Instrument contributing to Stability and Peace,

budget is set out in the Council position with the budget variations from year to year.
As regards staff levels, the Council accepted the establishment plans as proposed by the Commission in the DB for 2016.
The margin available under heading 5 is EUR 605.5 million.

2015/2132(BUD) - 14/10/2015 Document attached to the procedure
PURPOSE: presentation of Amending Letter N°2 to the draft general budget 2016 - updating of the estimated needs for agricultural
expenditure and fisheries Managing the refugee crisis: immediate budgetary measures under the European Agenda on Migration.
CONTENT: this Amending Letter No 2 (AL2) to the draft budget for the year 2016 covers the following:
-

the updating of the estimated needs, assigned revenue and appropriations for agricultural expenditure. In addition to changing
market factors, the AL 2/2016 also incorporates the impact of decisions in the agricultural sector since the draft budget (DB) 2016
was presented in May 2015 as well as other proposals expected to have a significant effect during the budget year. After taking into
account of the additional revenue assigned to the EAGF, the net result for heading 2 is a decrease of EUR 477.3 million for both
commitment and payment appropriations;

-

an update of the situation for Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreements, to take account of the latest estimates, on the basis of
which the necessary expenditure is EUR 11 million lower, for both commitment and payment appropriations, than originally
estimated;

-

the necessary reinforcements for immediate measures to manage the refugee crisis under the European Agenda on Migration,
building on the measures proposed in draft amending budget 7/2015, as follows:
·

Heading 3: Security and Citizenship: a reinforcement of emergency assistance in favour of Member States more exposed, the
increased capacity of the three front-line agencies, as well as the integration of the two relocation decisions taken in September
2015 and the need for a further top-up of funding under the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) and the Internal
Security Fund (ISF). Altogether, the proposed measures for 2016 require a reinforcement of EUR 1 380 million in commitment
appropriations and EUR 778.8 million in payment appropriations. Consequently, the Commission proposes to mobilise the
Flexibility Instrument for an amount of EUR 1 504 million in heading 3. This includes EUR 124 million, which the Commission
already proposed to mobilise from the Flexibility Instrument together with the initial draft budget 2016; such a proposal is now
repealed and replaced by the new draft act accompanying this amending letter.

·

Heading 4: Global Europe: an increase for Humanitarian Aid of EUR 150 million in commitment appropriations and EUR 405
million in payment appropriations, and a reinforcement of the payment appropriations for the European Neighbourhood
Instrument of EUR 210 million.

·

Heading 5: Administration: an increase of EUR 23.9 million in commitment and payment appropriations to cover salaries and
missions.

-

an increase of EUR 5 million in commitment and payment appropriations to cover the fees obligations towards the European
Investment Fund (EIF) for the implementation of the new small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) window products under the
European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI).

-

a budgetary neutral amendment to the structure of the establishment plan of the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators
(ACER);

-

a reduction of EUR 20 million in payment appropriations under the Food and Feed programme.

The net budgetary impact of these changes across all headings is an increase in commitment appropriations of EUR 1 070.6 million, and in
payment appropriations of EUR 914.5 million.

2015/2132(BUD) - 16/10/2015 Budgetary report tabled for plenary, 1st reading
The Committee on Budgets adopted the report by José Manuel FERNANDES (EPP, PT) (Section III Commission) and Gérard DEPREZ
(ALDE, BE) (other sections). The committee approved the motion for a resolution on the Council position on the draft general budget of the
European Union for the financial year 2016.
Firstly, the report stressed that Parliament's reading of the 2016 budget fully reflects the political priorities such as internal and external
solidarity, in particular:
an effective tackling of the migration and refugee crisis;
as well as in boosting competitiveness through the creation of decent and quality employment and the development of enterprises and
entrepreneurship across the Union (the three Es).
Highlighting that the Union is currently facing a number of serious emergencies, Members stressed the urgent need for necessary financial
resources to be deployed in the Union budget, in order to match these political challenges.
Overall, Members set the overall level of appropriations for 2016 at EUR 157 427.5 million and EUR 146 459.5 million in commitment and
payment appropriations respectively.
The keys areas dealt with in the report are as follows:
Migrant crisis: in this regard, they decided, therefore, to immediately put forward a comprehensive package of amendments increasing the

Draft Budget (DB) by EUR 1 161 million both on Heading 3 (Security and Citizenship) and Heading 4 (Global Europe), in order to provide an
initial response to the migration crisis.
Union economy: Members stressed that more effort are needed to be undertaken to address the shortcomings in the Union economy by
boosting competitiveness, growth and quality jobs. Therefore, they:
reinforced the COSME programme by EUR 16.5 million;
adopted a EUR 473.2 million increase for 2016 for the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI);
restored all cuts (especially to Horizon 2020 and the Connecting Europe Facility) proposed by Council to the DB (EUR 563.6 million in
commitments and EUR 1 421.8 million in payments).
As regards dairy farmers, Members decided to take action with regard to the ongoing crisis affecting European farmers, notably in the dairy
sector, and to already integrate in its position on the 2016 budget the EUR 500 million support emergency measures announced by the
Commission.
Payments: Members reiterated the importance of the joint payment plan 2015-2016 agreed, ahead of the budgetary procedure, by Parliament,
the Council and the Commission, which reflects the commitment of the three institutions to reduce the backlog of outstanding payments. They
decided to restore the DB in payments on all lines cut by the Council , on the assumption that the payment levels proposed by the Commission
in its DB are the ones needed to achieve the objectives of the payment plan.
They reinforced, by an appropriate ratio, payment appropriations on all those lines which are amended in commitment appropriations, taking
into account areas with a fast disbursement profile or a high degree of urgency namely Erasmus+, the two relocation schemes, UNRWA and
humanitarian aid. They increased payment appropriations by a further EUR 1 billion to fully cover by fresh appropriations the frontloading of
payments for Greece. They also decided to increase payments for the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.

2015/2132(BUD) - 28/10/2015 Budgetary text adopted by Parliament
The European Parliament adopted by 434 votes to 185 with 80 abstentions, a resolution on the Council position on the draft general budget of
the European Union for the financial year 2016.
Section III Commission: Parliament stressed that its reading of the 2016 budget fully reflected the political priorities adopted by an
overwhelming majority in its resolutions of 11 March 2015 on general guidelines and of 8 July 2015 on a mandate for the trilogues.
These priorities were;
internal and external solidarity, in particular an effective tackling of the migration and refugee crisis;
boosting competitiveness through the creation of decent and quality employment and the development of enterprises and
entrepreneurship across the Union (the three Es);
It highlighted that the Union was currently facing a number of serious emergencies, notably the unprecedented migration and refugee crisis to
which was necessary to respond not only with financial resources but also with a comprehensive approach to address both the internal and
external dimension.
Migration crisis: Parliament considered that extraordinary times required extraordinary measures. It asked the Commission to come up with a
proposal on how the EU budget could prompt Member States towards a more balanced approach to solidarity.
Parliament recalled its earlier statements on the handling of migration flows. It decides, therefore, to immediately put forward a comprehensive
package of amendments increasing the Draft Budget (DB) by EUR 1 161 million both on Heading 3 (Security and Citizenship) and Heading 4
(Global Europe), in order to provide an initial response to the migration crisis. Those amendments should be considered alongside the
Commissions Letter of amendment No 2/2016, which includes, in addition to the second relocation package, the additional measures set out in
the abovementioned Commission communication of 23 September 2015. Members regretted that Parliament and the Council did not have
more time to examine the suitability of that Letter but stressed that Parliament fully endorsed these new measures and intended to defend their
financing through fresh appropriations. Members also decided to take action with regard to the ongoing crisis affecting European farmers,
notably in the dairy sector, and to already integrate in its position on the 2016 budget the EUR 500 million support emergency measures
announced by the Commission.
New measures on the European economy: Parliament considered that a lot more effort needed to be undertaken to address the shortcomings
in the Union economy by boosting competitiveness, growth and quality jobs. It reinforced therefore the COSME programme by EUR 16.5
million. It decided also to propose new commitments in 2016 for the continuation of the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI), and adopted,
therefore, a EUR 473.2 million increase for 2016.
Payments: Parliament stressed the importance of fully respecting the joint statement on a payment plan 2015-2016 agreed between
Parliament, Council and Commission, following the shared commitment to reduce the backlog of outstanding payment claims for the
2007-2013 cohesion programmes to around EUR 2 billion by the end of 2016. It criticised, in this respect, the fact that the Council's proposed
cuts are in direct contradiction with this payment plan. It restored all cuts proposed by Council to the Draft Budget (EUR 563.6 million in
commitments and EUR 1 421.8 million in payments) and stated that it failed to understand the reasoning behind the proposed cuts.
Parliaments position: Members concluded that, for the purpose of adequately financing these pressing needs, all means available in the MFF
Regulation in terms of flexibility, including the full mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument, would need to be deployed.
It set the overall level of appropriations for 2016 at:
EUR 157 427,3 million in commitment appropriations and
EUR 146 459,3 million in payment appropriations.
With regard to each sub-heading, Parliament stated as follows:
Sub-heading 1a: Parliament criticised the fact that, again this year, sub-heading 1a is severely affected by the Council's cuts with a
reduction of EUR 140.9 million in commitments and EUR 435.4 million in payments as compared to the Draft Budget; around half of

these cuts are targeted at Horizon 2020, which results in a further reduction for this programme in 2016 after that part of its
appropriations have been redeployed to EFSI. Accordingly, Parliament decided to propose some selective increases above the level
of the DB for COSME, Horizon 2020, EaSI and Erasmus+ programmes. It increased the level of commitment and payments
appropriations for sub-heading 1a above the DB by EUR 1 405.5 million and EUR 491.5 million respectively (including pilot projects
and preparatory actions), thus exceeding the ceiling for commitments by EUR 1 316.9 million, to be financed by all means available as
regards flexibility in the MFF Regulation after exhaustion of the available margins;
Sub-heading 1b: Parliament disapproved of Council's proposed cuts of EUR 3.1 million in commitments and, more importantly, EUR
220.1 million in payments under sub-heading 1b, including on completion lines. Taking account of pilot projects and preparatory
actions, it increased commitment appropriations for sub-heading 1b by EUR 482.7 million and payment appropriations by EUR 1 164
million above the Draft Budget, thus exceeding the ceiling for commitments by EUR 467.3 million to be financed by any means
available as regards flexibility;
Heading 2: Parliament welcomed the presentation by the Commission of a EUR 500 million comprehensive package of emergency
measures to support European farmers, notably in the dairy sector amid falling commodity prices and greater milk production. It
stressed the increasing tasks assigned to the Union as part of the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, and therefore restored the
level of appropriations of the 2015 budget for scientific advice in fisheries. Parliament increased therefore commitment appropriations
by EUR 510.4 million and payment appropriations by EUR 520.6 million leaving a margin of EUR 647.2 million below the ceiling for
commitments in Heading 2;
Heading 3: in light of the current exceptional flows of migrants and refugees, Parliament decided to concentrate its reinforcements on
strengthening the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF), to incorporate the necessary funds in its reading, and to align the
first relocation package with the second one by adding EUR 20 million to finance transport costs (EUR 500 per migrant to Italy and
Greece). It approved an additional increase of EUR 79 million for general reinforcement of the AMIF and recalled that point 17 of IIA
allows for an increase of more than 10 % in the amount envisaged for the entire duration of a programme when the new, objective,
long-term circumstances arise. Parliament noted that its reading exceeded the ceiling of Heading 3 by EUR 1 055.1 million in
commitments, with EUR 931.1 million above the Draft Budget. It proposed, therefore, to mobilise any means available in the MFF to
finance the package of reinforcements linked to migration.
Heading 4: Parliament pointed out that, of all headings, Heading 4 bears the biggest cuts by the Council both in commitments (- EUR
163,4 million) and in payments (- EUR 450,4 million). It decided to restore the level of appropriations provided for by the Draft Budget,
reaffirming that the increases in payment appropriations proposed by the Commission were merely necessary, notwithstanding the
unprecedented migration and refugee crisis. It complemented the package of amendments on migration and the refugee crisis by
adopting targeted reinforcements in commitment appropriations first and foremost within the European Neighbourhood Instrument (+
EUR 178,1 million) and also in the Development Cooperation Instrument (+ EUR 26,6 million), Humanitarian aid (+ EUR 26 million),
the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (+ EUR 11,2 million), the Instrument contributing to Stability and Peace (+ EUR 12,6
million) and the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (+ EUR 1 million). It stressed, however, that this ceiling might
be insufficient given that it has been set well before major developments in Ukraine, Syria, Tunisia and more generally throughout the
neighbouring countries, the Middle East and Africa.
Heading 5: noting the Council cuts in this heading, Parliament decided to restore the Draft Budget on all the lines of administrative and
research support expenditure in policy areas and on all the lines in Heading 5 decreased by the Council, as well as to approve a
limited number of small reinforcements.
Agencies: Parliament decided to increase, within the overall package on migration, the appropriations for the main agencies working in this
field: the European Asylum Support Office, Frontex, Europol, Eurojust, eu.LISA, Cepol and the Fundamental Rights Agency for a total of EUR
26 million.
Other sections: with regard to its own budget, Parliament recalled that EUR 15 million has been earmarked for urgent investments in security
and cybersecurity, setting the overall level of its 2016 budget at EUR 1 838 648 600 as adopted in Plenary on 29 April 2015. In an oral
amendments adopted in Plenary, Parliament stated that, in order to ensure adequate support to Members for the accomplishment of their
parliamentary activities, a new balance is necessary between accredited parliamentary assistants and local assistants, and it welcomed the
agreement reached in the Bureau.
It should be noted that a replacement resolution presented by the ECR group was rejected in plenary by 65 votes to 580 with 49 abstentions.
