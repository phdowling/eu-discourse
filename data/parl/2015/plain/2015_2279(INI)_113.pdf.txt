2015/2279(INI) - 04/04/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Regional Development adopted the own-initiative report by Iliana IOTOVA (S&D, BG) on cohesion policy in mountainous
regions of the EU.
Mountainous regions in the EU are rarely in the focus of Cohesion Policy. Yet, mountainous regions represent a significant amount of EU
territory (around 30 %), and the entirety of the EU depends on their ecosystem services.
This report focuses on how the mountains of the EU can contribute to its targets, such as Europe 2020. It contains the following
recommendations:
Coordinated approach and general considerations: the report called on the Commission to start the process of creating a working definition for
functional mountainous regions in the context of Cohesion Policy, complementing the definition of mountainous areas as used in the context of
the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, with the aim of improving coordination of the policies and measures concerned.
This definition must be wide and inclusive, taking into account different factors such as altitude, accessibility and slope. It should cover
volcanic regions in islands and outermost regions, as well as areas that, while not mountainous, are largely integrated with mountain areas.
Members welcomed the current initiatives for the Carpathian Mountains in the EU Strategy for the Danube Region and the progress made on
the EU macro-regional strategy for the Alps.
The Commission is also invited to:
present a communication containing an agenda for EU mountainous regions and subsequent to this, present a White Paper on the
development of mountainous regions, based on best practices and involving local, regional and national authorities;
encourage the use of financial instruments in mountainous regions in order to reach concrete results;
Members also called for synergies to be increased by means of the coordination of EU policies, strategies and programmes that have an
indirect effect upon mountainous regions, such as Horizon 2020, COSME, LIFE, Natura 2000, the EU Broadband Strategy, the EU Climate
Adaptation Strategy, the EU Environment Action Programme, the Connecting Europe Facility, European Territorial Cooperation, ESI Funds
and the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI), as well as macro-regional strategy initiatives.
The European Territorial Cooperation (ETC) instrument offers an excellent opportunity to share best practices and knowledge among
mountainous regions, which in many cases are located on national borders. Members called for a specific mountain dimension in the future
ETC.
Jobs and economic growth in mountainous regions: in this regard, the report highlighted the need to:
pay specific attention to the development of SMEs in mountainous regions, particularly areas affected by natural and
climate-aggravated disasters, urges the Member States accordingly to give priority to investment in infrastructure and services in
mountain areas;
improve the marketing of agricultural products and including them within the general tourism products of a given geographical area;

moreover, as mountain areas have strong potential for producing high-quality food products and to start the debate about introducing
special labelling for mountain food products at EU level;
emphasise, within the strategy, the economic dimension of forestry taking into account the economic and social role of forestry in
mountain areas;
put in place additional incentives to preserve small processing enterprises and small and medium-sized mountain farms in
mountainous areas;
use the ESI Funds for economic sectors that do not pollute and are future-oriented, such as sustainable tourism, cultural heritage,
sustainable forestry, high-speed internet development, crafts, and renewable energy.
Sustainable growth, environment, accessibility: the report lays down the points that should be included in the agenda and the sector-specific
policy:
increase the qualifications of the workforce and creating new jobs in the green economy should be part of the investment priorities of
the ESI Funds;
attract young people into the agricultural sector by encouraging young entrepreneurs to branch out in areas relating to cultural
heritage;
the CAP should aim to compensate the natural and economic disadvantages that farmers face but should also give them the means to
capitalise on their assets;
ensure sustainable milk production in mountain areas;
ensure the development and improvement of healthcare facilities and services in mountainous regions;
support innovative solutions, including IT-based ones, for access to basic quality education, as well as formal and informal education
and lifelong learning opportunities, in remote mountainous areas;
more effective implementation of the Youth Guarantee as a good opportunity to stop the outflow of young people from mountainous
regions;
focus on policies that encourage and facilitate the use of renewables in mountainous regions and place climate change at the heart of
a future 'Agenda for EU Mountainous Regions'.
Lastly, Members considered that the Internet, and more specifically, next-generation access technologies play a crucial part in overcoming the
challenges faced by mountainous regions. They considered therefore that specific support from ESI Funds is needed for the promotion of
employment, social inclusion and empowerment in the emerging digital economy.

2015/2279(INI) - 10/05/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 553 votes to 63, with 49 abstentions, a resolution on cohesion policy in mountainous regions of the EU.
Members recalled that mountainous regions in the EU are rarely in the focus of Cohesion Policy. Yet, these regions represent a significant
amount of EU territory (around 30 %), and the entirety of the EU depends on their ecosystem services. These regions are structurally
disadvantaged, owing to their extreme conditions and remoteness, to the extent that many mountainous regions face depopulation and ageing
populations.
Parliament made a number of recommendations as to how the mountains of the EU can contribute to its targets, such as Europe 2020.
Coordinated approach and general considerations: given that there is no explicit definition of mountainous regions in EU regional policy,
Parliament called on the Commission to start the process of creating a working definition for functional mountainous regions in the context of
Cohesion Policy, complementing the definition of mountainous areas as used in the context of the European Agricultural Fund for Rural
Development, with the aim of improving coordination of the policies and measures concerned.
This definition must be wide and inclusive, taking into account different factors such as altitude, accessibility and slope. It should cover
volcanic regions in islands and outermost regions, as well as areas that, while not mountainous, are largely integrated with mountain areas.
Members welcomed the current initiatives for the Carpathian Mountains in the EU Strategy for the Danube Region and the progress made on
the EU macro-regional strategy for the Alps.
Parliament considered that EU policies should have a specific approach to mountainous regions, as they have clear structural disadvantages.
The Commission is invited to:
present a communication containing an agenda for EU mountainous regions and establish a specific, in?depth programme to protect
those European glaciers which are predicted to disappear by 2050;
present a White Paper on the development of mountainous regions, based on best practices and involving local, regional and national
authorities;
encourage the use of financial instruments in mountainous regions in order to reach concrete results;
regularly assess the condition of mountainous regions in the EU, and analyse data, such as the results of the implementation of
Cohesion Policy operational programmes and indicators, in order to focus EU funding and policy implementation in a correct way;
propose a European Year of Islands and Mountains.
The managing authorities are called upon to consider increasing allocations of ESI Funds at national level to support undeveloped
mountainous areas, using a multi-sectoral policy approach, where possible.
Parliament also called for synergies to be increased by means of the coordination of EU policies, strategies and programmes that have an
indirect effect upon mountainous regions, such as Horizon 2020, COSME, LIFE, Natura 2000, the EU Broadband Strategy, the EU Climate
Adaptation Strategy, the EU Environment Action Programme, the Connecting Europe Facility, European Territorial Cooperation, ESI Funds
and the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI), as well as macro-regional strategy initiatives.
The European Territorial Cooperation (ETC) instrument offers an excellent opportunity to share best practices and knowledge among
mountainous regions, which in many cases are located on national borders. Members called for a specific mountain dimension in the future
ETC.

ensure sustainable milk production in mountain areas;
present specific recommendations for overcoming the shortage of skilled labour in the tourism industry, specifically addressing the
challenges of unattractive jobs and insufficient remuneration;
ensure the development and improvement of healthcare facilities and services in mountainous regions, inter alia through cross-border
cooperation initiatives, including the development of cross-border healthcare establishments, where needed;
encourage tailor?made solutions adapted to local and regional needs to access public services;
support innovative solutions, including IT-based ones, for access to basic quality education, as well as formal and informal education
and lifelong learning opportunities, in remote mountainous areas;
more effective implementation of the Youth Guarantee as a good opportunity to stop the outflow of young people from mountainous
regions;
focus on policies that encourage and facilitate the use of renewables in mountainous regions and place climate change at the heart of
a future 'Agenda for EU Mountainous Regions'.
create incentives for more active development of public-private partnerships in mountainous regions, in transport, communication and
energy infrastructure, as the lack of economies of scale makes the provision of these services commercially unattractive.
Lastly, Parliament considered that the Internet, and more specifically, next-generation access technologies play a crucial part in overcoming
the challenges faced by mountainous regions. It considered therefore that specific support from ESI Funds is needed for the promotion of
employment, social inclusion and empowerment in the emerging digital economy.
