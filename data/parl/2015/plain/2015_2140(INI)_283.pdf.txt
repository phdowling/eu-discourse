2015/2140(INI) - 04/06/2015 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: presentation of the report on Competition Policy 2014.
CONTENT: 2014 was marked by the European elections and a new European Commission.
Following the European elections, the European Parliament gave its green light to the new European Commission on the basis of the priorities
outlined in President Junckers Political Guidelines. The mission letter addressed to Margrethe Vestager, Commissioner for Competition, states
that competition policy would contribute, as appropriate, to our jobs and growth agenda, including in areas such as: (i) the digital single market,
(ii) energy policy, (iii) financial services, (iv) industrial policy and (v) the fight against tax evasion. Indeed, competition policy encompassed all
these areas in 2014.
(1) Towards a connected digital single market: the Commission believes that competition policy can help building a genuine Digital Single
Market:
in the knowledge based sectors, vibrant competition is essential to stimulate innovation and spread the benefits of technological
development among Europes citizens;
effective enforcement of antitrust and merger policy makes it easier for small businesses to thrive and gain access to markets in
sectors dominated by network effects;
the application of State aid rules to the broadband sector helps to provide good coverage at affordable prices.
The Commission seeks to:
promote infrastructure development and competitive markets for broadband and telecoms networks;
ensures that broadband and mobile networks remain open and competitive, a sine qua non for building a vibrant Digital Single Market;
ensure that competition policy actions focus on smart devices and online services.
In the increasingly important field of online services, the Commission continued carrying out its investigation into certain of Googles business
practice. It is investigating concerns that Google may be abusing its dominant position in the markets for web search, online search advertising
and online search advertising intermediation (i.e. the display of Google search advertising on partner sites) in the European Economic Area.

An important feature of the area of smart mobile devices concern standard-setting procedures and interoperability. In this context, the
Commission adopted two important decisions on the enforcement of standard essential patents (SEPs) in April: a prohibition decision against
Motorola Mobility, and a commitment decision with regard to Samsung.
Lastly, in March, the Commission adopted new rules for the assessment of technology transfer agreements under EU antitrust rules.
(2) Making energy markets work better: In the energy sector, competition policy:
ensures that companies do not maintain or re-erect barriers to protect themselves from competition, hampering the establishment of a
European Energy Union;
helps to ensure fair and non-discriminatory access to energy infrastructure, removes obstacles to market integration, and fosters
competition between and within Member States.
In April 2014, the Commission adopted the new Guidelines on State aid for environmental protection and energy (EEAG). Moreover, the
revised State aid rules on energy and environment assist Member States to better target their support for example to renewable energy
sources, infrastructure investments, generation capacity or relief of electro-intensive users from the financing of renewables support.
Antitrust enforcement actions in the energy sector contributed in particular to tackling high energy prices by addressing segmentation of
markets and abusive or collusive behaviour, especially in Eastern and Central European markets.
The Commission remains vigilant on energy markets also using its State aid and merger control tools. In particular, it makes sure that powerful
upstream players do not attempt to integrate downstream and thereby excessively strengthen their control over the value chain.
(3) Fairer and more transparent financial sector: the Commission has been particularly vigilant in financial services with the main goal of
bringing a stable and fairer financial sector back to its core function of lending to the real economy:
the creation of the Banking Union is increasing the confidence of European citizens and markets in the European banking system;
enforcement actions coupled with regulatory efforts also focused on tackling anticompetitive practices in financial derivatives and in
the payments sector.
In order to promote healthy competition in the payment sector to the benefit of European consumers, the Commission is continuing to tackling
anti-competitive business models based on multilateral interchange fees (MIFs).
In February, the Commission rendered legally binding the commitments offered by Visa Europe to significantly cut its MIFs for credit card
payments, as well as to reform its rules to facilitate cross-border competition.
(4) Boosting competitiveness of European industry: the new State aid framework is designed to channel government support where it matters
most for growth and competitiveness.
New Risk Finance State aid Guidelines were adopted giving EU countries better tools to facilitate access to finance for European
SMEs and midcaps in their early development stage.
The Commission adopted new rules to facilitate the granting of aid in support of research, development and innovation.
In the framework of the State Aid Modernisation, the Commission adopted a communication on Important Projects of Common
European Interests (IPCEI) which opens new avenues for Member States to finance certain projects.
In November, the Commission announced the creation of the European Fund for Strategic Investment (EFSI), with the objective to
enhance investment in Europe by generating EUR 315 billion investment. To maximise the impact of such investments, the
Commission will formulate a set of core principles, for the purpose of state-aid assessments, which a project will have to meet to be
eligible for support under the Fund.
In 2014 the Commission also completed the revision of the Guidelines on State aid for rescuing and restructuring non-financial
undertakings in difficulty.
In addition, in 2014 the Commission investigated and punished several cartels concerning input and intermediate products.
(5) Fight against tax avoidance and evasion: the new Commission will continue to focus on the fight against tax avoidance and tax evasion. In
2014, the Commission tightened its control of fiscal State aid, by using EU competition tools to make sure that EU countries do not help
selected multinational companies avoid paying their fair share of taxes.

2015/2140(INI) - 17/12/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs adopted an own-initiative report by Werner LANGEN (EPP, DE) following the 2014 Annual
report on EU Competition Policy.
Welcoming the report by the Commission, which underlines the importance of competition policy in the EU, Members called on the
Commission not to implement internal EU competition policy in such a way as to restrict firms market strategies , so that they can compete on
world markets with actors from outside the EU.
An effective and credible competition policy must not be directed exclusively towards bringing down prices for consumers, but must also be
mindful of the strategic interests of the European economy, such as: the ability to innovate; investment; competitiveness and sustainability; the
special competitive conditions for SMEs, start-ups and microenterprises; and the need to promote high labour and environmental standards.
The Commission was called upon to:
put a stop to social dumping, and ensure that competition policy decisions take particular account of the social impact in remote or
isolated regions;
adapt its competition policy to the specificities of the digital economy sector, and support all initiatives connected with the development
of e-government;
complete the internal market in areas where it is still fragmented and incomplete, and to end unjustified market restrictions and
distortions of competition as soon as possible wherever they are found;
ensure that competition policy strengthens social cohesion in the Union;

ensure that the Member States implement the new public procurement legislation in a timely manner, in particular as regards the
deployment of e-procurement and e-administration, and the new provisions on consideration of social and environmental criteria and
on the division of contracts into lots;
promote better convergence of, and cooperation among, national competition authorities in the EU;
safeguard competition in the telecommunication sector, including in the allocation of spectrum;
scrutinise the unfair and unlawful clauses and practices employed by the banking sector in consumer contracts;
ensure coherence between the Unions trade and competition policies and the objectives of its industrial policy , and ensure at the
same time that the Unions competition policy should not hinder the emergence of European industrial champions in economy.
Antitrust proceedings cases of abuse of dominant position: in this regard, Members asked the Commission:
to increase its efforts as regards investigations of instances of abuse of dominant market positions to the detriment of EU consumers;
take action internationally against cartels and anticompetitive, oligopolistic and monopolistic practices that are damaging to
competition;
incorporate the rules on fines, such as those imposed in cartel proceedings, into a legislative instrument; the fines should be high
enough to act as a deterrent;
carry out, on the basis of new criteria, a comprehensive legal and economic assessment of fast-moving markets and ephemeral
business models employed by digital undertakings, in order to obtain a clear understanding of the market structure and market trends,
take appropriate measures to protect consumers;
provide effective protection for standard essential patents (SEPs) and to exercise close supervision to ensure that patent users obtain
licences in the proper way.
Members called into question the long duration of the investigations into US internet giant Google, and regretted the fact that these
investigations have already dragged on for several years, with no transparency and creating uncertainty for all parties. The Commission was
asked to: ((i) conduct a thorough investigation into the Google practice whereby the Android operating system is offered only in conjunction
with other Google services, and whereby manufacturers may not pre-install rival products; (ii) examine in detail Googles dominant market
position in the area of direct hotel bookings.
State aid: the report called on the Commission, on Member States and on authorities at regional and communal administrative levels actively
to promote compliance with EU competition policy and to explain its legal basis. It emphasised the importance of addressing horizontal and
vertical State aid in the same way but took the view that remote or outlying regions and islands should be given greater leeway than at present
when it comes to applying rules on State aid. It recalled that the structural funds may not be used in a way that directly or indirectly encourages
the relocation of services or production to another Member State.
Members welcomed the introduction of new guidelines on State aid for risk financing, the primary purpose of which is to make it possible to
promote more effectively SMEs, innovative midcaps and start-ups, which have a significant size disadvantage.
Financial aid and taxation: Members recalled that the temporary State aid in the financial sector was necessary for the stabilisation of the
global financial system, but must quickly be reduced, or totally removed and scrutinised, if the Banking Union is to be completed. They
believed that the Commission should consider the possibility of linking State aid to banks to conditionality on credit to SMEs.
Unfair tax competition between Member States is another problem raised in the report, which brought to light the key importance of EU
subsidy law in the fight against tax avoidance by multinational undertakings. Members welcomed the investigations initiated by the
Commission in 2014 into unlawful State aid, through unfair tax competition, to the benefit of certain individual companies, which was extended
to all the 28 EU countries in 2015. They called furthermore, on Member States in future to present to the Commission all relevant information
about their tax practice, and, at long last, to comply with their obligation to disclose to the Commission and to Parliament details of any special
arrangements that may have an impact on other Member States and SMEs. The Commission should use the findings of the current
investigations as the basis for more precise and effective guidelines for tax-related State aid.
In view of studies estimating the annual value of tax fraud and tax avoidance to up to EUR one trillion (1 000 000 000 000), Member States
must ultimately tackle and restrict this practice. Members called for a EU legislative framework to prevent distortions of competition by
aggressive tax planning and tax evasion. They recommended the introduction of an automatic mandatory exchange of tax rulings, a common
consolidated corporate tax base (CCCTB) and a guarantee that no profit leaves the EU untaxed.
Democratic strengthening of competition policy: Members welcomed the regular dialogue between the Competition Commissioner and
Parliament, but considers that the right to a hearing on essential matters of principle is not sufficient. They considered that Parliament should
have co-decision powers in competition policy, particularly with regard to fundamental legislative directives and binding guidelines. The
Commission was asked to put forward proposals for a corresponding amendment to the Treaties to extend the scope of the ordinary legislative
procedure to cover competition law as well.

2015/2140(INI) - 19/01/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 500 votes to 137, with 73 abstentions, a resolution following the 2014 Annual report on EU Competition
Policy.
Welcoming the report by the Commission, which underlines the importance of competition policy in the EU, Parliament called on the
Commission not to implement internal EU competition policy in such a way as to restrict firms market strategies , so that they can compete on
world markets with actors from outside the EU.
An effective and credible competition policy must not be directed exclusively towards bringing down prices for consumers, but must also be
mindful of the strategic interests of the European economy, such as: the ability to innovate; investment; competitiveness and sustainability; the

The Commission was called upon to:

adapt its competition policy to the specificities of the digital economy sector, and support all initiatives connected with the development

of e-government;
complete the internal market in areas where it is still fragmented and incomplete, and to end unjustified market restrictions and
distortions of competition as soon as possible wherever they are found;
ensure that competition policy strengthens social cohesion in the Union;
ensure that the Member States implement the new public procurement legislation in a timely manner, in particular as regards the

promote better convergence of, and cooperation among, national competition authorities in the EU;
safeguard competition in the telecommunication sector, including in the allocation of spectrum;
scrutinise the unfair and unlawful clauses and practices employed by the banking sector in consumer contracts;
examine ATM networks from the perspective of competition policy, given that this is a network infrastructure;
ensure coherence between the Unions trade and competition policies and the objectives of its industrial policy , and ensure at the
same time that the Unions competition policy should not hinder the emergence of European industrial champions in economy;
review EU State aid rules for energy-intensive industries, guaranteeing effective carbon leakage protection and providing fair
opportunities for EU industries.
Antitrust proceedings cases of abuse of dominant position: in this regard, Parliament also asked the Commission:
to increase its efforts as regards investigations of instances of abuse of dominant market positions to the detriment of EU consumers;
take action internationally against cartels and anticompetitive, oligopolistic and monopolistic practices that are damaging to
competition;
incorporate the rules on fines, such as those imposed in cartel proceedings, into a legislative instrument; the fines should be high

The Commission was asked to: ((i) conduct a thorough investigation into the Google practice whereby the Android operating system is offered
only in conjunction with other Google services, and whereby manufacturers may not pre-install rival products; (ii) examine in detail Googles
dominant market position in the area of direct hotel bookings.
The resolution noted that the Google case has triggered a general discussion on the power of dominant internet platforms such as eBay,
Facebook, Apple, LinkedIn, Amazon, Uber, Airbnb, etc., their influence on markets and on the public sphere, and the need to regulate them to
protect both.
State aid: Parliament:
called on the Commission, the Member States and the authorities at regional and communal administrative levels actively to promote
compliance with EU competition policy and to explain its legal basis;
emphasised the importance of addressing horizontal and vertical State aid in the same way but took the view that remote or outlying
regions and islands should be given greater leeway than at present when it comes to applying rules on State aid;
called on the Commission to examine evidence provided by the Member States more rigorously, and improve fact security, since there
are regular attempts to circumvent the legal basis and the legal constraints, or to seek more or fewer borderline compromises;
recalled that the structural funds may not be used in a way that directly or indirectly encourages the relocation of services or
production to another Member State.
Members welcomed the introduction of new guidelines on State aid for risk financing, the primary purpose of which is to make it possible to
promote more effectively SMEs, innovative midcaps and start-ups, which have a significant size disadvantage.
Financial aid and taxation: Members recalled that the temporary State aid in the financial sector was necessary for the stabilisation of the
global financial system, but must quickly be reduced, or totally removed and scrutinised, if the Banking Union is to be completed. They called
on the Commission to: (i) clarify the rules and procedures under which State aid in the financial sector can be authorised; (ii) consider the
possibility of linking State aid to banks to conditionality on credit to SMEs.
Unfair tax competition between Member States is another problem raised in the resolution, which brought to light the key importance of EU
subsidy law in the fight against tax avoidance by multinational undertakings. Members welcomed the investigations initiated by the
Commission in 2014 into unlawful State aid, through unfair tax competition, to the benefit of certain individual companies, which was extended
to all the 28 EU countries in 2015. They called furthermore, on Member States in future to present to the Commission all relevant information
