2015/2317(INI) - 02/05/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Development adopted the own-initiative report by Cristian Dan PREDA (EPP, RO) on the EU 2015 Report on Policy
Coherence for Development (PCD).
Members recalled that 1.5 billion people are still living in poverty with deprivation in health, education and living standards, and most of them
are women. They reiterated that PCD is a key element for delivering the new sustainable development agenda.
PCD in the framework of the 2030 Agenda: the report stated that PCD should contribute to the establishment of the rule of law, to impartial
institutions and to tackling the challenge of good governance in developing countries. Members regretted that little progress has been made as
to its concrete implementation, and called for an EU-wide debate on PCD in the framework of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda and
its new 17 universal and indivisible sustainable development goals. They called for PCD to be discussed at a European Council meeting in
order to foster an interinstitutional debate involving the Commission, the EEAS, the Council, and Parliament, as well as debate at the national
level. They also called for concrete recommendations to the EU heads of state and government on effective mechanisms to operationalise
PCD and integrate EU strategies to better implement sustainable development goals.
Members called on the Commission systematically to consult human rights organisations at an early stage of the policymaking process on
development and believed that more emphasis must be put on institutional coordination, whether between EU institutions or with Member
States. The governments of the Member States were asked embed PCD in a legally binding act.
Stressing the important role that Parliament must play in the process of promoting PCD, they noted the need for an appropriate level of
resources and staff to implement PCD correctly. In this context, Members called on the Commission to identify incoherencies without delay
and produce an analysis of their cost, as well as to develop adequate monitoring and progress-tracking mechanisms on PCD. They pointed to
the need to strengthen PCD in the context of the revision of the European Consensus for Development and of the discussions on the future
post-Cotonou agreement.
Members discussed a certain number of priority areas as follows;
-Migration: acknowledges that the EU is facing its biggest refugee crisis since World War II, the report stressed that strengthening the link
between migration and development policies is essential to addressing the root causes of this phenomenon. It underlined that the response to
the refugee crisis should not focus only on security concerns and that development objectives must be better integrated so as to make EU
migration policies compatible with those that seek to reduce poverty in developing countries. Members also emphasised that the EU needs
greater harmonisation of migration and asylum policies, and underlined the importance of developing a single common asylum and
immigration policy. In order to enhance coherence between migration and development policies, they called on the EU and its Member States,
not to report refugee costs as ODA, as doing so has a huge opportunity cost at the expense of development programmes.
-Trade and finance: the committee stressed that the EU and its Member States taken together remain the most important Aid for Trade donor
in the world (EUR 11.7 billion in 2013). It recalled the commitment by Member States to make concrete efforts towards the target of 0.7 % of

GNP as ODA to developing countries, and underlined that trade agreements should contribute to the promotion of sustainable development,
while noting that trade liberalisation is not per se positive for poverty eradication. Members recalled that EU investment policy, especially when
involving public money, must contribute to the realisation of the sustainable development goals and advocated boosting the use of developingcountry procurement systems for aid programmes in support of activities managed by the public sector with a view to enhancing the local
private sector.
Members recalled, however, that aid alone is not sufficient. They believed that innovative and diversified sources of financing such as a
financial transaction tax, a carbon tax, an air ticket levy, rents from natural resources, etc., must be considered. They recognised the
importance of creating favourable conditions for the private sector in developing countries.
Members also called on the EU to set up an appropriate framework to address how corporations integrate human rights and social and
environmental standards. They supported an efficient, fair and transparent tax system in line with good governance principles. They called on
the EU to ensure that corporations pay taxes in the countries where value is extracted or created by them. They urged the EU, to this effect, to
strive for the establishment of a new intergovernmental body under the auspices of the UN on international cooperation on tax matters. -Food
security: the report emphasised that achieving global food security, particularly if the more ambitious targets of Agenda 2030, namely to fully
eradicate hunger and end all forms of malnutrition, are to be met, it will be necessary promote the establishment of robust regulatory
frameworks with clear criteria. It called on the EU to evaluate systematically the impact of EU agricultural, trade and energy policies such as
biofuel policy on food security in the developing world. The Commission was urged to concentrate on cooperatives, micro, small and
medium-scale farming and agricultural workers, and to promote sustainable and agro-ecological practices.
Members emphasised that the EU must support the establishment of processing industries in the agricultural sector and the improvement of
food storage techniques. The also called on the EU and its Member States to contribute to the prevention of land grabs.
-Climate change: Members called for determined action from the EU, its Member States and all international partners in implementing the
recent COP21/Paris climate agreement. The EU and other developed countries must continue to support climate action to reduce emissions
and build resilience to climate change impacts in developing countries, and in particular in least developed countries (LDCs). Members
recalled the crucial importance of the provision of adequate climate finance in this context, and supported the process of EU energy transition.
They called for the establishment of strategic priorities at all levels and across all sectors, and implementation of new binding climate targets.
-Security: Members called on the EU to strengthen its capacities for crisis prevention and early response in order to reinforce the synergies
between the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) and development instruments. They suggested that creating a new instrument
dedicated to the development-security nexus might limit incoherencies and increase the efficiency of PCD. This instrument should not be
financed through existing development instruments, but through new budgetary appropriations. The report called for reinforced collaboration
between the Commission, the EEAS and the Member States in order to deliver a comprehensive analysis that enables an informed choice
between CSDP and non-CSDP actions when dealing with a crisis.
On the security of Sahel, Members believed that the African Rapid Reaction Force and the Sahel Regional Action Plan 2015-2020 are good
examples of a successful implementation of the EUs comprehensive approach, effectively mixing security, development and governance
responses.
Lastly, Members called on the Commission and the Member States to continue improving links between humanitarian aid, development
cooperation and resilience to disasters so as to enable a more flexible and effective response to growing needs.

2015/2317(INI) - 07/06/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 523 votes 79 with 72 abstentions, a resolution on the EU 2015 Report on Policy Coherence for
Development (PCD).
Parliament recalled that 1.5 billion people are still living in poverty with deprivation in health, education and living standards, and most of them
are women. It reiterated that PCD is a key element for delivering the new sustainable development agenda.
PCD in the framework of the 2030 Agenda: Parliament stated that PCD should contribute to the establishment of the rule of law, to impartial
institutions and to tackling the challenge of good governance in developing countries. It regretted that little progress has been made as to its
concrete implementation, and called for an EU-wide debate on PCD in the framework of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda and its
new 17 universal and indivisible sustainable development goals. It called for PCD to be discussed at a European Council meeting in order to
foster an interinstitutional debate involving the Commission, the EEAS, the Council, and Parliament, as well as debate at the national level. It
also called for concrete recommendations to the EU heads of state and government on effective mechanisms to operationalise PCD and
integrate EU strategies to better implement sustainable development goals.
Parliament welcomed the Better Regulation Package adopted by the Commission on 19 May 2015, and further welcomes the fact that PCD is
specifically mentioned as a legal requirement in Tool 30 of the Better Regulation Guidelines ( COM(2015)0215). The Plenary regretted,
however, the fact that although impact assessments represent a significant tool for achieving PCD, assessments of development impacts
remain few in number and do not properly address the potential impact on developing countries. It hoped that the Better Regulation Package
and its guidelines would improve this situation by taking development and human rights into account in all impact assessments and by
enhancing transparency.
Members called on the Commission systematically to consult human rights organisations at an early stage of the policymaking process on
development and believed that more emphasis must be put on institutional coordination, whether between EU institutions or with Member
States. The governments of the Member States were asked embed PCD in a legally binding act.
Parliament called on the Commission systematically to consult human rights organisations at an early stage of the policymaking process and
to put in place stronger safeguards and mechanisms in order to better balance stakeholders representativeness. It welcomed the public
consultation on the roadmap, which is aimed at determining the outcome and impact of PCD on developing countries and considered it
necessary to undertake more systematic ex-post assessments during EU policy implementation.
Stressing the important role that Parliament must play in the process of promoting PCD, the resolution noted the need for an appropriate level
of resources and staff to implement PCD correctly. In this context, Members called on the Commission to identify incoherencies without delay
and produce an analysis of their cost, as well as to develop adequate monitoring and progress-tracking mechanisms on PCD. They pointed to

the need to strengthen PCD in the context of the revision of the European Consensus for Development and of the discussions on the future
post-Cotonou agreement.
Parliament recognises that implementing PCD correctly in national and European strategies will require an appropriate level of resources and
staff.
Members discussed a certain number of priority areas as follows;
-Migration: acknowledges that the EU is facing its biggest refugee crisis since World War II, the report stressed that strengthening the link
between migration and development policies is essential to addressing the root causes of this phenomenon. It underlined that the response to

effect, to strive for the establishment of a new intergovernmental body under the auspices of the UN on international cooperation on tax
matters. It urged the EU to support developing countries in building their capacities in the areas of tax administration, financial governance and
managing public finances, and in curbing illicit financial flows.
-Food security: Parliament emphasised that achieving global food security, particularly if the more ambitious targets of Agenda 2030, namely
to fully eradicate hunger and end all forms of malnutrition, are to be met, it will be necessary promote the establishment of robust regulatory

recalled the crucial importance of the provision of adequate climate finance in this context, and supported the process of EU energy transition.
It also stressed that failure to limit global warming to well below 2° C may undermine development gains. It called on the EU to assume a
proactive role in addressing the global climate challenge by establishing strategic priorities at all levels and across all sectors.
Gender dimension: Parliament called on the EU effectively to mainstream gender equality and womens empowerment in all its policies,
including budgets, and to ensure that its external policies contribute to combating all forms of discrimination, including against LGBT persons.
-Security: Parliament called on the EU to strengthen its capacities for crisis prevention and early response in order to reinforce the synergies
between the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) and development instruments. It suggested that creating a new instrument
dedicated to the development-security nexus might limit incoherencies and increase the efficiency of PCD. This instrument should not be
