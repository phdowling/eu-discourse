2015/0275(COD) - 02/12/2015 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to revise the rules on waste management in order to facilitate Europes transition to a circular economy.
PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with Council.
BACKGROUND: the Commission considers that recent trends suggest that turning waste into a resource is an essential part of increasing
resource efficiency and closing the loop in a circular economy. The Unions economy currently loses a significant amount of potential
secondary raw materials that are found in waste streams. In 2013, total waste generation in the EU amounted to approximately 2.5 billion tons
of which 1.6 billion tons were not reused or recycled and therefore lost for the European economy. It is estimated that an additional 600 million
tons could be recycled or reused. By way of example, only a limited share (43%) of the municipal waste generated in the Union was recycled,
with the rest being landfilled (31%) or incinerated (26%).
With respect to waste management, the Union also faces large differences amongst its Member States. In 2011, while six Member States
landfilled less than 3% of their municipal waste, 18 landfilled over 50%, with some exceeding 90%. This uneven situation needs to be
redressed.
The proposal aiming to amend Directive 2008/98/EC on waste is part of a series of measures on the circular economy which also includes
proposals to amend:
Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste
Directive 1999/31/EC on the landfill of waste

Directive 2000/53/EC on end-of-life vehicles
Directive 2006/66/EC on batteries and accumulators and waste batteries and accumulators,
Directive 2012/19/EU on waste electrical and electronic equipment.
The proposals build in part on the proposal that the Commission tabled in July 2014 and subsequently withdrew in February 2015. They are in
line with the objectives of the Resource Efficiency Roadmap and the 7th Environment Action Programme including:
full implementation of the waste hierarchy in all Member States;
decline in absolute and per capita waste generation;
ensuring high quality recycling and the use of recycled waste as a major, reliable source of raw materials for the Union.
They also contribute to the implementation of the EU Raw Materials Initiative and address the need to prevent food waste.
IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment led to the conclusion that the options envisaged will bring the following benefits:
reduction of the administrative burden in particular for small establishments or undertakings, simplification and better implementation
including by keeping targets fit for purpose;
more than 170,000 direct jobs could be created by 2035, most of them impossible to delocalize outside the EU;
GHG emission reduction more than 600 millions of tons of green house gas could be avoided between 2015 and 2035;
positive effects on the competitiveness of the EU waste management and recycling sectors as well as on the EU manufacturing
sector ;
reinjection into the EU economy of secondary raw materials which in turn will reduce the dependency of the EU on raw materials
imports.
CONTENT: the proposal to amend Directive 2008/98/EC responds to the legal obligation to review the waste management targets in that
Directive to make them better reflect the Union's ambition to move to a circular economy.
The main points are as follows:
Alignment of definitions: it is proposed to include in Directive 2008/98/EC definitions of municipal waste, construction and demolition waste, the
final recycling process, and backfilling so that the scope of these concepts is clarified. The definition of municipal waste should be in line with
the definition used for statistical purposes by the European Statistical Office and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development. It is neutral with regard to the public or private status of the operator managing waste.
Economic measures: Member States should put in place adequate incentives for the application of the waste hierarchy, in particular, by means
of financial incentives aimed at achieving the waste prevention and recycling objectives of this Directive , such as landfill and incineration
charges, pay as you throw schemes, extended producer responsibility schemes and incentives for local authorities.
Waste or non-waste status: the proposal establishes at the Union level harmonised conditions for substances or objects to be recognised as
by-products and for waste that has undergone a recovery operation to be recognised as having ceased to be waste.
Producer responsibility schemes: given that the effectiveness of these schemes differ significantly between Member States, the proposal sets
minimum operating requirements for extended producer responsibility. Those requirements should:
define in a clear way the roles and responsibilities of producers of products placing goods on the market of the Union;
define measurable waste management targets, in line with the waste hierarchy, aiming to attain at least the quantitative targets
relevant for the scheme as laid down in the Directive;
establish a reporting system to gather data on the products placed on the Union market by the producers subject to extended
producer responsibility.
Waste prevention: Member States should:
encourage the use of products that are resource efficient, durable, reparable and recyclable;
target products that are the main sources of raw materials of a high importance to the economy of the Union and whose supply is
associated with a high risk to prevent that those materials become waste;
encourage the setting up of systems promoting reuse activities, including in particular for electrical and electronic equipment, textiles
and furniture;
reduce waste generation in processes related to industrial production, extraction of minerals and construction and demolition, taking
into account best available techniques;
monitor and assess the implementation of the waste prevention measures.
Prevention of food waste: Member States should take measures to promote prevention of food waste in line with the 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 25 September 2015, and in particular its target of halving food
waste by 2030.
These measures should aim to prevent food waste in primary production, in processing and manufacturing, in retail and other distribution of
food, in restaurants and food services as well as in households. Member States should establish specific food waste prevention measures and
should measure progress in food waste reduction.
Re-use and recycling: Member States shall take measures:
to promote preparing for re-use activities, notably by encouraging the establishment of and support for re-use and repair networks and
by facilitating the access of such networks to waste collection points, and by promoting the use of economic instruments, procurement
criteria, quantitative objectives or other measures;
promote high quality recycling and set up separate collection of waste where technically, environmentally and economically
practicable.
Municipal waste: the proposal provides for an increase in the targets of preparing for re-use and the recycling of municipal waste, from 60%
until 2025 to 65% in 2030.
Estonia, Greece, Croatia, Latvia, Malta, Romania and Slovakia may obtain five additional years for the attainment of these targets. In the event

of an extension, the Member State shall take the necessary measures to increase the preparing for re-use and the recycling of municipal
waste to a minimum of 50% and 60% by weight, by 2025 and 2030 respectively.
Bio-waste: Member States should ensure the separate collection of bio-waste where technically, environmentally and economically
practicable. They should encourage the recycling, including composting, and digestion of bio-waste, the treatment of bio-waste in a way that
achieves a high level of environmental protection.
The proposal also provides for:
the adoption of improved and simplified definitions and uniform calculation methods for recycling throughout the EU;
the establishment of common rules for reporting in order to ensure the reliability of data gathered for recycling;
introduction of an Early Warning System for monitoring compliance with the recycling targets;
simplification and streamlining of reporting obligations.
DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of
the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

2015/0275(COD) - 09/02/2017 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety adopted the report by Simona BONAFÈ (S&D, IT) on the proposal for a
directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2008/98/EC on waste.
The committee recommended that the European Parliaments position adopted at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure
should amend the Commission proposal as follows:
Members introduced amendments aiming to strengthen waste prevention measures and encourage the development of an efficient secondary
raw materials market.
They stressed that the Waste Framework Directive is an important instrument to enhance the circular economy.
By-products: Members stipulated that a substance or object resulting from a production process the primary aim of which is not the production
of that substance or object shall be considered not to be waste, but to be a by-product if certain conditions are met. They withheld the
possibility for the Commission to be empowered to establish harmonised criteria on the application of by-product status, prioritising proven and
replicable industrial and agricultural symbiosis practices.
End-of-waste status: the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts establishing harmonised provisions related to the
end-of-waste status to certain types of waste. Where criteria have not been set at a Union level, Member States should be allowed to establish
detailed end-of-waste criteria at national level for certain waste in accordance with conditions set at Union level.
The weight of waste which is considered to have ceased to be waste may be reported as recycled if the materials or substances that have
ceased to be waste are to be subject to reprocessing, excluding energy recovery and the reprocessing into materials that are to be used as
fuels or for backfilling operations.
Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) schemes: Members proposed introducing Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) schemes and to
define it based on harmonised rules. Member States should ensure the establishment of extended producer responsibility schemes for at least
packaging, electrical and electronic equipment, batteries and accumulators, and end-of-life vehicles.
Waste prevention: in order to contribute to the prevention of waste, Member States shall aim to achieve, at least, the following objectives:
a significant reduction in waste generation;
decoupling of waste generation from economic growth;
a progressive substitution of substances of very high concern if there are suitable alternative substances or technologies that are
economically and technically viable;
a Union food waste reduction target of 30 % by 2025 and of 50 % by 2030 compared to the 2014 baseline;
a Union marine litter reduction target of 30 % by 2025 and 50 % by 2030 compared to the 2014 baseline.
In order to achieve these objectives, Member States shall in particular promote and support sustainable production and consumption models;
discourage the placing on the market of products with planned obsolescence; reduce food losses along the whole supply chain and prevent
littering.
By 31 December 2018, the Commission shall examine the possibility of setting up Union-wide waste prevention targets to be met by 2025 and
2030.
Re-use: Members suggested defining more clearly the notion of reuse. Re-use, should be regarded as a specific waste prevention measure
and incentivised by the Member States.
Preparation of re-use and recycling: Member States shall take ambitious measures in respect of the preparing for re-use. They shall set up
mandatory separate collection of textiles by 2020 and take measures to promote sorting systems for commercial and industrial waste for at
least the following: metals, plastics, paper and cardboard, bio-waste, glass and wood.
Members proposed that by 2030, the preparing for re-use and the recycling of municipal waste shall be increased to a minimum of 70 % by
weight of municipal waste generated, including a minimum of 5 % of total municipal waste prepared for re-use. The Commission had proposed
a target of 65 %.
Member States which in 2013 recycled less than 20% of their municipal waste may ask the Commission for an additional five years in order to
reach the preparation for re-use and recycling targets set for 2025 and 2030. To obtain these exemptions, the Member States concerned
should submit an implementation plan, to be assessed by the Commission on the basis of specific criteria, and should meet interim targets
relating to preparation for re-use and recycling.
The Commission shall examine the possibility of setting preparing for reuse and recycling targets that apply to commercial waste,

non-hazardous industrial waste and other waste streams to be met by 2025 and 2030.
Members also placed emphasis on the need for specific measures for the reprocessing of organic waste and called for the separate collection
of bio-waste to be made mandatory and supported with suitable economic instruments.
Framework for the circular economy: no later than 31 December 2018, the Commission shall draw up a report assessing the need for Union
targets, particularly for a Union resource efficiency target, as well as a report identifying obstacles hampering the shift to a circular economy. It
should present a comprehensive review of Union eco-design legislation.

2015/0275(COD) - 14/03/2017 Text adopted by Parliament, partial vote at 1st reading/single
reading
The European Parliament adopted by 576 votes to 95, with 27 abstentions, amendments to the proposal for a directive of the European
Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2008/98/EC on waste.
The matter was referred back to the committee responsible for interinstitutional negotiations. The vote on the legislative resolution has been
postponed to later session.
The main amendments adopted in plenary concerned the following issues:
Aim: Parliament stipulated that this Directive shall lay down measures to protect the environment and human health by:
preventing or reducing the adverse impacts of the generation and management of waste;
reducing overall impacts of resource use and improving the efficiency of such use;
ensuring waste is valued as a resource with a view to contributing to a circular economy in the Union.
Members stressed the need to apply the waste hierarchy in order to enhance the transition towards a circular economy. They also wanted to
encourage the use of secondary raw materials.
Municipal waste: the definition of municipal waste shall cover mixed waste and separately collected waste from small businesses, office
buildings and institutions including schools, hospitals, and government buildings that is similar to household waste in nature and composition.
The terms commercial and industrial waste, sorting, litter, food waste and residual waste have also been highlighted.
Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) schemes: Members proposed introducing Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) schemes and to
define it based on harmonised rules. Extended producer responsibility is an individual obligation on producers who should be accountable for
the end-of-life management of products that they place on the market.
Member States should ensure the establishment of extended producer responsibility schemes for at least packaging, electrical and electronic
equipment, batteries and accumulators, and end-of-life vehicles.
Waste prevention: Member States shall aim to achieve, at least, the following objectives:
a significant reduction in waste generation;
decoupling of waste generation from economic growth;
a progressive substitution of substances of very high concern if there are suitable alternative substances or technologies that are
economically and technically viable;
a Union food waste reduction target of 30 % by 2025 and of 50 % by 2030 compared to the 2014 baseline and similar objectives
marine litter.
In order to achieve these objectives, Member States shall in particular promote and support sustainable production and consumption models;
discourage the placing on the market of products with planned obsolescence; reduce food losses along the whole supply chain and prevent
littering.
By 31 December 2018, the Commission shall examine the possibility of setting up Union-wide waste prevention targets to be met by 2025 and
2030.
Re-use: Members suggested defining more clearly the notion of reuse. Re-use, should be regarded as a specific waste prevention measure
and incentivised by the Member States. Measures shall be encouraged to promote the re-use of products. These measures may include
encouraging the establishment and support of recognised re-use networks, deposit-refund and return-refill schemes and incentivising
remanufacturing, refurbishment and repurposing of products.
Preparation of re-use and recycling: Member States shall take ambitious measures in respect of the preparing for re-use. They shall:
set up mandatory separate collection of textiles by 2020;
take measures to ensure the sorting of construction and demolition waste ;
promote sorting systems for commercial and industrial waste for at least the following: metals, plastics, paper and cardboard,
bio-waste, glass and wood;
set up separate collection for hazardous waste from households.
Parliament proposed that by 2030, the preparing for re-use and the recycling of municipal waste shall be increased to a minimum of 70 % by
weight of municipal waste generated, including a minimum of 5 % of total municipal waste prepared for re-use. The Commission had proposed
a target of 65 %.
Member States which in 2013 recycled less than 20% of their municipal waste may ask the Commission for an additional five years in order to
reach the preparation for re-use and recycling targets set for 2025 and 2030. To obtain these exemptions, the Member States concerned
should submit an implementation plan, to be assessed by the Commission on the basis of specific criteria, and should meet interim targets
relating to preparation for re-use and recycling.

The Commission shall examine the possibility of setting preparing for reuse and recycling targets that apply to commercial waste,
non-hazardous industrial waste and other waste streams to be met by 2025 and 2030.
Parliament also placed emphasis on the need for specific measures for the reprocessing of organic waste and called for the separate
collection of bio-waste to be made mandatory and supported with suitable economic instruments.
Framework for the circular economy: no later than 31 December 2018, the Commission shall draw up a report assessing the need for Union
targets, particularly for a Union resource efficiency target, as well as a report identifying obstacles hampering the shift to a circular economy. It
should present a comprehensive review of Union eco-design legislation.
