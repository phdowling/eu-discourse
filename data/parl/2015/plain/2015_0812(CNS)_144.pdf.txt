Summary

2015/0812(CNS) - 01/10/2015 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to approve the conclusion, by Eurojust, of the Agreement on Cooperation between Eurojust and Montenegro.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Implementing Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to
follow its opinion.
BACKGROUND: Decision 2002/187/JHA stipulates that Eurojust may conclude agreements with third States and organisations. Such
agreements may, in particular, concern the exchange of information, including personal data, and the secondment of liaison officers or liaison
magistrates to Eurojust. Such agreements may only be concluded after consultation by Eurojust with the Joint Supervisory Body concerning
the provisions on data protection and after the approval by the Council.
In order to strengthen its capacity to work with Montenegro, Eurojust has negotiated an Agreement on Cooperation between Eurojust and
Montenegro.
Montenegro has ratified the Council of Europe Convention and its Additional Protocol regarding supervisory authorities and transborder data.
The Joint Supervisory Body of Eurojust gave a positive opinion on the provisions of the Agreement concerning data protection. The Agreement
was approved by the College of Eurojust on 9 June 2015.
CONTENT: in accordance with the draft implementing Decision, Eurojust is hereby authorised to conclude the Agreement on Cooperation
between Eurojust and Montenegro.
The Agreement contains provisions on the exchange of personal data.
Denmark, the United Kingdom and Ireland shall take part in the adoption and application of this Decision.

2015/0812(CNS) - 19/01/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs adopted, in the framework of a special legislative procedure (consultation of
Parliament), the report by Nathalie GRIESBECK (ALDE, FR) on the draft Council implementing decision approving the conclusion by Eurojust
of the Agreement on Cooperation between Eurojust and Montenegro.
The committee recommended that Parliament approve the Council draft agreement on cooperation between Eurojust and Montenegro with the
aim of enhancing judicial cooperation in the fight against serious crime in particular organised crime and terrorism. The draft agreement
contains provisions concerning the operational cooperation between Eurojust and Montenegro, such as the secondment of a liaison
Prosecutor by Montenegro to Eurojust and the exchange of information including personal data.
The explanatory statement accompanying the report recalled that the Joint Supervisory Body of Eurojust (JSB) has approved the draft
agreement and that all Eurojust amendments to the draft agreement have been taking into account (particularly on data protection).
Accordingly, the committee supports the conclusion of this cooperation agreement with Montenegro, since it would aid and reinforce the fight
against serious crime and would contribute to enhancing judicial co-operation, in particular in the field of organised crime and terrorism.

2015/0812(CNS) - 02/02/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 567 votes to 58, with 63 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the draft Council implementing decision
approving the conclusion by Eurojust of the Agreement on Cooperation between Eurojust and Montenegro.
Parliament approved the Council draft in the framework of the consultation procedure.

To recall, this agreement aims to enhance judicial cooperation in the fight against serious crime in particular organised crime and terrorism. It
contains provisions concerning the operational cooperation between Eurojust and Montenegro, such as the secondment of a liaison
Prosecutor by Montenegro to Eurojust and the exchange of information including personal data. It seeks to aid and reinforce the fight against
serious crime and would contribute to enhancing judicial co-operation, in particular in the field of organised crime and terrorism.
