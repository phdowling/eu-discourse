Summary

The European Parliament adopted a resolution on Kyrgyzstan, homosexual propaganda bill.
The text adopted in plenary was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ECR, ALDE, GUE/NGL and Greens/EFA groups.
On 15 October 2014, the Kyrgyz Parliament passed at first reading draft bill 6-11804/14, which contains amendments to the Criminal Code,
the Code of Administrative Responsibility, the Law on Peaceful Assembly and the Law on Mass Media aimed at prohibiting the promotion of
non-traditional sexual relations in an open or indirect way and providing for up to one years imprisonment.
Parliament deeply regretted the presentation of this draft law, and any actions which could lead to cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment,
and calls on all countries to put an immediate end to the criminalisation of homosexuality.
Members called for the withdrawal of the draft law and called on the Commission, the Council and the External Action Service to make clear to
the Kyrgyz authorities that the eventual adoption of this bill could affect relations with the EU in line with the Partnership and Cooperation
Agreement.
Moreover, the Kyrgyz authorities are urged to:
reaffirm publicly that all people in Kyrgyzstan have the right to live free from discrimination and violence based on their sexual
orientation and gender identity and that any acts to the contrary are illegal and will be prosecuted;
take all the measures needed to ensure that human rights defenders can carry on their work of promoting and protecting human rights
without hindrance;
continue with reforms leading to transparency, independence of the judiciary, inter-ethnic reconciliation and respect for human rights;
ensure that allegations of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment are investigated promptly and efficiently and that perpetrators
are brought to justice.
Parliament welcomed the progress made by the Kyrgyz authorities in the domain of human rights in the period between the fourth and fifth
rounds of the EU-Kyrgyz Republic Human Rights Dialogue. It strongly urged the Kyrgyz authorities to continue progress in this field.
