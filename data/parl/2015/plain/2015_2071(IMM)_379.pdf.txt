Summary

2015/2071(IMM) - 11/05/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Legal Affairs adopted the report by Andrzej DUDA (ECR, PL), and recommended that Parliament waive the immunity of
Theodoros ZAGORAKIS (EPP, EL).
Members recalled that the Deputy Public Prosecutor at the Supreme Court of Greece had requested the waiver of the immunity of Theodoros

Zagorakis, Member of the European Parliament, in connection with possible legal action concerning an alleged offence. Mr Zagorakis was
accused of being responsible for financial irregularities between 2007 and 2012 at the PAOK football club, of which he was president at the
time.
The alleged offence clearly had no link with Mr Zagorakiss post as a Member of the European Parliament, but rather was connected to his
position as president of the PAOK football club.
Accordingly, there was no reason to suspect that the intention underlying the criminal proceedings was to damage the Members political
activity (fumus persecutionis), given that the prosecution was initiated a number of years before the Member took up his post.
Consequently, the Legal Affairs Committee recommended that Parliament waive the immunity of Theodoros Zagorakis.

2015/2071(IMM) - 19/05/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament decided to waive the immunity of Theodoros ZAGORAKIS (EPP, EL).
Parliament recalled that the Deputy Public Prosecutor at the Supreme Court of Greece had requested the waiver of the immunity of Theodoros
Zagorakis, Member of the European Parliament, in connection with possible legal action concerning an alleged offence. Mr Zagorakis was
accused of being responsible for financial irregularities between 2007 and 2012 at the PAOK football club, of which he was president at the
time.
Parliament noted that Article 9 of Protocol No 7 on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Union stated that Members of the European
Parliament shall enjoy, in the territory of their own state, the immunities accorded to members of the parliament of that state.
However, the alleged offence clearly had no link with Mr Zagorakiss post as a Member of the European Parliament, but rather was connected
to his position as president of the PAOK football club.
Accordingly, there was no reason to suspect that the intention underlying the criminal proceedings was to damage the Members political
activity (fumus persecutionis), given that the prosecution was initiated a number of years before the Member took up his post.
Consequently, Parliament decided to waive the immunity of Theodoros Zagorakis.
