Summary

2015/2857(RSP) - 29/10/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 425 votes to 31 with 6 abstentions a resolution tabled the Committee on Transport and Tourism on
allocation by the World Radiocommunication Conference, to be held in Geneva from 2 to 27 November 2015 (WRC-15), of the necessary
radio spectrum band to support the future development of a satellite-based technology to enable global flight tracking systems.
Recalling the tragedies involving Air France flight AF447 in June 2009 and Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 in March 2014, Parliament stated its
support for the Commissions action aimed at rapidly developing a performance-based global flight tracking system that would enable air
navigation service providers to determine the position of public transport aircraft at all times, even in remote locations. It stressed that such a
system should remain effective even in the event of loss of normal electrical power on board, and should not offer any possibility of being
disabled during the flight.
Parliament noted that the Commission, in cooperation with the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), the International Civil Aviation
Organisation (ICAO) and stakeholders, had started to study various technical options and had proposed rules on aircraft tracking with phased
implementation. Among the possible options currently being studied, the Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) technology,
supported by satellite communications, appeared to be very promising. The development of satellite-supported ADS-B technology might
require the allocation of an appropriate radio spectrum band in order to prevent any interference.
Accordingly, Parliament called on the Commission to take the necessary steps with a view to the next World Radiocommunication Conference
(WRC-15), to be held in Geneva in November 2015 regarding the allocation of the necessary radio spectrum band to support the future
development of a satellite-based global flight tracking system. The resolution stressed that when implementing ADS-B technology, it was
essential to consider the needs of all airspace users and to ensure interoperability between alternative technologies in order to avoid safety
and security breaches.
