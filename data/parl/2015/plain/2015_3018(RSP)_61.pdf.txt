Summary

The European Parliament adopted a resolution on Malaysia.
The text was adopted in plenary by the EPP, S&D, ECR, ALDE, Greens/EFA and EFDD groups.
Whilst reaffirming the EUs strong commitment to the Malaysian people with whom the EU has strong and longstanding political, economic and
cultural ties, Parliament deplored the deteriorating human rights situation in Malaysia and in particular the crackdown on civil society activists,
academics, media and political activists.
Parliament expressed its concern as regards:
the spike in the number of people facing charges or arrest under the Sedition Act under which at least 78 people have been
investigated or charged since the beginning of 2014;
the adoption of the National Security Council Bill and urged its withdrawal. This bill grants the National Security Council led by the
Prime Minister sweeping powers to declare a state of emergency in any area deemed a security risk, giving broad powers of arrest,
search and seizure without warrant.
The Malaysian Government is called upon to:
immediately release all political prisoners, including former opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim,
repeal the Sedition Act and to bring all legislation, including the Prevention of Terrorism Act, the Printing Presses and Publications Act,
the Communications and Multimedia Act, the Peaceful Assembly Act, and other relevant provisions of the penal code, in line with
international standards on freedom of expression and assembly and the protection of human rights;
establish the Independent Police Complaints and Misconduct Commission (IPCMC), as recommended by the Police Commission of
Inquiry in 2005, to investigate allegations of torture and deaths in police custody;
open a dialogue with opposition parties and civil society stakeholders;
ratify key international human rights conventions;
introduce a moratorium as the first step towards the abolition of the death penalty for all offences and to commute all death sentences
to prison terms.
Parliament called on:
the EU and its Member States to coordinate policies towards Malaysia, in line with the EU Strategic Framework on Human Rights;
the EU Delegation to Malaysia to step up efforts to finance projects on freedom of expression and reforming repressive laws, and to
use all appropriate tools, including the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, to protect human rights defenders;
the Commission to make sure that human rights concerns are duly taken into account during future negotiations on an EU-Malaysia
Free Trade Agreement and Partnership and Cooperation Agreement.
Parliament reaffirmed the importance of the EU-ASEAN policy dialogue on human rights as a useful tool to exchange good practices and
promote capacity-building initiatives.
