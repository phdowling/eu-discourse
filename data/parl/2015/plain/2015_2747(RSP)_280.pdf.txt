The European Parliament adopted a resolution on the Srebrenica Commemoration.

EP

Summary

The resolution was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ECR, ALDE and Greens/EFA groups.
Parliament condemned in the strongest possible terms the genocide in Srebrenica. It commemorated and honoured all the victims of the
Srebrenica genocide and of all the atrocities during the wars in the former Yugoslavia.
It recalled that during several days of carnage after the fall of Srebrenica, more than 8 000 Muslim men and boys, who had sought safety in
this area under the protection of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), were summarily executed by Bosnian Serb forces
commanded by General Mladi? and by paramilitary units, including irregular police units.
Nearly 30 000 women, children and elderly people were forcibly expelled in a massive-scale ethnic cleansing campaign, making this event the
biggest war crime to take place in Europe since the end of the Second World War.
Parliament emphasised the need for political representatives in Bosnia and Herzegovina to acknowledge the past in order to work successfully
together towards a better future for all citizens of the country. It urged the development of educational and cultural programmes that promote
an understanding of the causes of such atrocities and raise awareness about the need to nurture peace and to promote human rights and
interreligious tolerance.
The resolution stressed the importance of the work done by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the need
to take all necessary measures to accelerate the trials and appeals and bring them to an end without undue delay. It reiterated the EUs
commitment to the European perspective and further accession process of BiH and all Western Balkan countries.
Lastly, Members regretted that the UN Security Council, which has the primary responsibility for maintenance of international peace and
security, failed to pass a resolution commemorating the Srebrenica genocide.
