2015/0148(COD) - 15/07/2015 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to amend the EU emissions trading system (EU ETS) in order to enhance cost-effective emission reductions and promote
low-carbon investments.
PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLEOF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council established a system for greenhouse gas emission
allowance trading within the Union in order to promote reductions of greenhouse gas emissions in a cost-effective and economically efficient
manner.
To tackle climate change effectively and achieve the EU's long-term decarbonisation objectives to cut emissions by at least 80% by 2050, an
important step was taken when the European Council agreed in October 2014 the 2030 policy framework for climate and energy.
A centrepiece of the 2030 policy framework is the binding target to reduce overall EU greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% domestically
below 1990 levels by 2030. To achieve this target cost-effectively, the sectors covered by the EU emissions trading system (EU ETS) will have
to reduce their emissions by 43% compared to 2005 while non-ETS sectors will have to reduce their emissions by 30% compared to 2005.
The European Council confirmed that a well-functioning, reformed EU ETS with an instrument to stabilise the market would be the main
European instrument to achieve this target.
This proposal is part of the Commission's ten political priorities, and an important element of the Strategic Framework for the Energy Union.
IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment is largely based on the findings of the comprehensive impact assessment on the 2030
framework, focusing on certain ETS-specific methodological elements not already assessed. It includes (i) addressing the potential risk of
carbon leakage, (ii) the establishment of a Modernisation and an Innovation Fund, (iii) optional free allocation to modernise the electricity
sector in lower income Member States, as well as (iv) aspects building on the lessons learnt since 2013, such as the validity of emission
allowances, guaranteeing a robust and secure registry and the continuation of the optional exclusion of small emitters.
CONTENT : the proposal is a first piece of legislation implementing the 2030 Climate and Energy package agreed by the European Council in
October 2014, to achieve the EU 2030 greenhouse gas emission reduction target of at least -40% compared to 1990 in a cost effective
manner and to contribute to limiting global warming.
The EU ETS Directive exists and continues being in force post-2020. This proposal:
translates the 43% greenhouse gas reduction target in 2030 in the ETS into a cap declining by 2.2% annually from 2021 onwards,
corresponding to an additional reduction of around 556 million tonnes of carbon dioxide in the period 2021-2030 compared to the
current annual decline of 1.74%;
guarantees that free allocation to industry will continue after 2020 to address the potential risk of carbon leakage, as long as

comparable climate policies are not undertaken by other major economies. The proposal provides that the benchmarks for the
determination of the free allocation to industry will be updated to reflect the technological progress realised over time in the relevant
sectors. Sectors deemed to be exposed to a risk of carbon leakage would continue to receive a higher allocation than others who have
a higher ability to pass on relevant costs in product prices.
maintains the Innovation Fund as a stepped-up effort to rapidly introduce new low-carbon technologies to the market enabling the EU
to reach its long-term decarbonisation goals. Existing EU-level support for innovation is supplemented through dedicating 400 million
allowances for these purposes. An extra 50 million allowances is added to this amount from the allowances that remain unused in
2013 to 2020 and would otherwise be placed in the Market Stability Reserve in 2020.
establishes the Modernisation Fund and optional free allocation to the energy sector to contribute to the modernisation of the energy
systems in lower income Member States. The Modernisation Fund is created with 2% of the overall quantity of allowances. These will
be auctioned in accordance with the rules provided for in the EU ETS Auctioning Regulation to generate the necessary funds for
projects to be carried out.
The Commission also proposes that auction revenues should be used for climate financing actions in vulnerable third countries, including
adaptation to the impacts of climate.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the EU ETS generates significant revenues for Member States' budgets. The proposal affects national budgets
and administrations primarily because of this link. The secure operation of the Union registry is funded from the Union budget. There is also a
small and limited impact on the EU budget EUR 14,639 million - which is, however, fully covered by the current MFF 2014-2020.
DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of
the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

2015/0148(COD) - 13/01/2017 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety adopted the report by Ian DUNCAN (ECR, UK) on the proposal for a
directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2003/87/EC to enhance cost-effective emission reductions and
low-carbon investments.
The Committee on Industry Research and Energy, exercising its prerogative as an associated committee in accordance with Article 54 of the
Rules of Procedure, also gave its opinion on the report.
The committee responsible recommended that the European Parliaments position, adopted at first reading following the ordinary legislative
procedure, should amend the Commission proposal as follows:
Purpose: it is stipulated that the objective of the Directive is to achieve a certain level of emissions reductions in a way that does not lead to
carbon and investment leakage. Members stated that a well-functioning, reformed EU emission trading system (EU ETS) with an enhanced
instrument to stabilise the market and the removal of a significant number of surplus allowances from the market will be the main European
instruments to achieve this target.
Members advocated increasing the so-called linear reduction factor - the yearly reduction of credits, in order to deliver on the carbon curbs - by
2.4%, as against the 2.2% proposed by the European Commission.
Allocation and issuing of quotas: according to the report, unused free allowances should be made available to help address the risk of carbon
leakage in industries with high carbon and trade intensity.
From 1 January 2021, 50 % of allowances shall be auctioned
From 2019 onwards, Member States shall either auction or cancel allowances that are not allocated free of charge and are not placed in the
market stability reserve.
From 2021 onwards, the share of allowances to be auctioned or cancelled shall be 57 %, and that share shall decrease by no more than five
percentage points over the entire ten year period beginning on 1 January 2021.
In addition, 3 % of the total quantity of allowances to be issued between 2021 and 2030 shall be auctioned in order to compensate sectors or
sub-sectors which are exposed to a genuine risk of carbon leakage due to significant indirect costs actually incurred as a result of greenhouse
gas emission costs being passed on in electricity prices.
Members also agreed that 800 million allowances should be removed from the Market Stability Reserve as of 1 January 2021.
Just Transition Fund: this Fund shall be created as of 1 January 2021 as a complement to the European Regional Development Fund and the
European Social Fund and shall be funded through the pooling of 2% of the auctioning revenues.
The revenues of those auctions would remain at Union level, with the goal of using them to cushion the social impact of climate policies in
regions which combine a high share of workers in carbon-dependent sectors and a GDP per capita well below the Union average.
Those auctioning revenues aimed at just transition can be put to use in different ways, such as: (i) creating redeployments and/or mobility
cells, (ii) education/training initiatives to re-skill or upskill workers, (iii) support in job search, (iv) business creation.
Aviation: an amendment stipulated that the total quantity of allowances to be allocated to aircraft operators in 2021 shall be 10% lower than
the average allocation for the period from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2016 , and then decrease annually at the same rate as that of the
total cap for the EU ETS so as to bring the cap for the aviation sector more in line with the other EU ETS sectors by 2030.
From 2021 onwards, no free allocation of allowances under this Directive shall be granted to the aviation sector unless it is confirmed by a
subsequent decision adopted by the European Parliament and the Council.
Auction revenues should also be used for climate financing actions in vulnerable third countries, including adaptation to the impacts of climate
change.
Maritime transport: as from 2021, in the absence of a comparable system operating under the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), CO2

emissions emitted in Union ports and during voyages to and from Union ports of call, shall be accounted for.
In the event that an international agreement on global measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from maritime transport is reached, the
Commission shall review this Directive and shall, if appropriate, propose amendments in order to ensure alignment with that international
agreement.
Members proposed setting up a fund to compensate for maritime emissions, improve energy efficiency, facilitate investments in innovative
technologies and reduce CO2 emissions from the sector.
Innovation: 600 million allowances shall be available to leverage investments in innovation in low-carbon technologies and processes in
industrial sectors listed in Annex I of the Directive, including bio-based materials and products substituting carbon intensive materials.
Collection of information and non-compliance: under current provisions, the European Commission fully depends on the information provided
by the Member State. However, in case reporting is incorrect or other irregularities occur, a violation of the provisions of the Directive may
significantly distort level playing field for industries and energy producers in the Union. In this context it is justified to give the Commission the
possibility to collect information independently.
In order to ensure an equal level of compliance across the Union, and to ensure a level playing field for industries participating in the EU ETS,
the Commission should have the right to conduct an independent investigation where it is suspected that compliance is not ensured by
national authorities.

2015/0148(COD) - 15/02/2017 Text adopted by Parliament, partial vote at 1st reading/single
reading
The European Parliament adopted by 379 votes to 263, with 57 abstentions, amendments to the proposal for a directive of the European
Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2003/87/EC to enhance cost-effective emission reductions and low-carbon investments.
The issues was referred back to the committee responsible, for interinstitutional negotiations.
The main amendments made in plenary concern the following issues:
Emission reduction: Members called for a well-functioning, reformed Union emission trading system (EU ETS) with an enhanced instrument to
stabilise the market. They approved the Commission proposal to increase the so-called linear reduction factor - the yearly reduction of credits,
in order to deliver on the carbon curbs to 2.2 % from 2021 and shall be kept under review with a view to increasing it to 2.4 % by 2024 at the
earliest.
Small emitter: the existing provisions which are in place for small installations to be excluded from the EU ETS should be extended to cover
installations operated by small to medium enterprises (SMEs) emitting less than 50 000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent in each of the three years
preceding the year of the application for exclusion.
Allocation and issuing of quotas: unused free allowances should be made available to help address the risk of carbon leakage in industries
with high carbon and trade intensity. Members stated that from 1 January 2021, 50 % of allowances shall be auctioned.
From 2019 onwards, Member States shall either auction or cancel allowances that are not allocated free of charge and are not placed in the
market stability reserve.
From 2021 onwards, the share of allowances to be auctioned or cancelled shall be 57 %, and that share shall decrease by no more than five
percentage points over the entire ten year period beginning on 1 January 2021.
In addition, 3 % of the total quantity of allowances to be issued between 2021 and 2030 shall be auctioned in order to compensate sectors or
sub-sectors which are exposed to a genuine risk of carbon leakage due to significant indirect costs actually incurred as a result of greenhouse
gas emission costs being passed on in electricity prices.
Parliament also agreed that 800 million allowances should be removed from the Market Stability Reserve as of 1 January 2021.
Just Transition Fund: this Fund shall be created as of 1 January 2021 as a complement to the European Regional Development Fund and the
European Social Fund and shall be funded through the pooling of 2% of the auctioning revenues.
The revenues of those auctions would remain at Union level, with the goal of using them to cushion the social impact of climate policies in
regions which combine a high share of workers in carbon-dependent sectors and a GDP per capita well below the Union average.
Those auctioning revenues aimed at just transition can be put to use in different ways, such as: (i) creating redeployments and/or mobility
cells, (ii) education/training initiatives to re-skill or upskill workers, (iii) support in job search, (iv) business creation.
Aviation: an amendment stipulated that the total quantity of allowances to be allocated to aircraft operators in 2021 shall be 10% lower than
the average allocation for the period from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2016 , and then decrease annually at the same rate as that of the
total cap for the EU ETS so as to bring the cap for the aviation sector more in line with the other EU ETS sectors by 2030.
From 2021 onwards, no free allocation of allowancesunder this Directive shall be granted to the aviation sector unless it is confirmed by a
subsequent decision adopted by the European Parliament and the Council.
Auction revenues should also be used for climate financing actions in vulnerable third countries, including adaptation to the impacts of climate
change.
Maritime transport: as from 2021, in the absence of a comparable system operating under the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), CO2
emissions emitted in Union ports and during voyages to and from Union ports of call, shall be accounted for through a system set which shall
be operational from 2023.
In the event that an international agreement on global measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from maritime transport is reached, the
Commission shall review this Directive and shall, if appropriate, propose amendments in order to ensure alignment with that international
agreement.

Parliament proposed setting up a Maritime Climate Fund to compensate for maritime emissions, improve energy efficiency, facilitate
investments in innovative technologies and reduce CO2 emissions from the sector.
Innovation: the amended text provides that 600 million allowances shall be available to leverage investments in innovation in low-carbon
technologies and processes in industrial sectors listed in Annex I of the Directive, including bio-based materials and products substituting
carbon intensive materials and to help stimulate the construction and operation of commercial demonstration projects that aim at the
environmentally safe capture and storage (CCS) and carbon capture and use (CCU).
In order to promote innovative projects, up to 75% of the relevant costs of projects may be supported.
Collection of information and non-compliance: in case of a reasonable suspicion of irregularities or a failure by a Member State to provide the
list and the information set out in the Directive, the Commission may start an independent investigation and investigate other possible
infringements, such as failure to implement the Third Energy Package.
