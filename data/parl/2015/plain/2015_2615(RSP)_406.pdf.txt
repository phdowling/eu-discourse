Summary

2015/2615(RSP) - 15/04/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 554 votes to 13, with 44 abstentions, a resolution on the occasion of International Roma Day
anti-Gypsyism in Europe and EU recognition of the memorial day of the Roma genocide during World War II.
The resolution was tabled by the PPE, S&D, PPE, S&D, ECR, ALDE, GUE/NGL, Verts/ALE and EFDD groups.

Parliament recognised solemnly the historical fact of the genocide of Roma that took place during World War II and invited Member States to
do the same. It declared that a European day should be dedicated to commemorating the victims of the genocide of the Roma during World
War II and that this day should be called the "European Roma Holocaust Memorial Day".
Members expressed their deep concern at the rise of anti-Gypsyism, as manifested inter alia through anti-Roma rhetoric and violent attacks
against Roma in Europe, including murders,
which are incompatible with the norms and values of the European Union and constitute a major obstacle to the successful social integration of
Roma and to ensuring full respect for their human rights.
Underlining the need to combat anti-Gypsyism at every level and by every means, Parliament called on the Member States to:
·

implement effectively Council Directive 2000/43/EC implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of
racial or ethnic origin, in order to prevent and eliminate discrimination against Roma, in particular in employment, education and
access to housing;

·

implement effectively Council Framework Decision 2008/913/JHA on combating certain forms and expressions of racism and
xenophobia by means of criminal law;

·

further strengthen the fight against anti-Gypsyism as part of their National Roma Integration Strategies; in this regard, Members
stressed the need to ensure that specific measures for womens rights and gender mainstreaming and considering children a priority
when implementing the EU Framework for National Roma strategies.

The Commission, for its part, was called upon to effectively monitor and assess Member
States compliance with the fundamental values of the EU.
Recalling that Roma are part of Europes culture and shared values, Parliament encouraged the Member States and other European countries
to address the history of Roma people through dialogue with citizens and young people, in particular the genocide of Roma during World War
II.
