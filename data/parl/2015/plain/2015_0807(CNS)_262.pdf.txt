Summary

2015/0807(CNS) - 10/07/2015 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to fix the date of effect of Decision 2008/633/JHA concerning access for consultation of the Visa Information System (VIS) by
designated authorities of Member States and by Europol for the purposes of the prevention, detection and investigation of terrorist offences
and of other serious criminal offences.
PROPOSED ACT: Council implementing Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to
follow its opinion.
BACKGROUND: Decision 2008/633/JHA provides that it is to take effect from a date to be determined by the Council once the Commission
has informed the Council that Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the Visa Information
System (VIS) and the exchange of data between Member States on short-stay visas (VIS Regulation) has entered into force and is fully
applicable.
The Commission informed the Council that Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 had entered into force and had been fully applicable as from 27
September 2011.
The conditions for triggering the exercise by the Council of its implementing powers pursuant to Decision 2008/633/JHA have been met and an
implementing decision fixing the date of effect of Decision 2008/633/JHA should therefore be adopted.
To recall, the proposed Decision replaces Council Decision 2013/392/EU, which was annulled by a judgment of the Court of Justice of the
European Union. In that judgment, the Court maintained the effects of Decision 2013/392/EU until the entry into force of a new act intended to
replace it. Therefore, as of the date of entry into force of this Decision, Decision 2013/392/EU ceases to produce effects.
In order to ensure the continuity of access rights for consultation of the VIS by designated authorities of Member States and by Europol for the
purposes of the prevention, detection and investigation of terrorist offences and of other serious criminal offences, the date from which
Decision 2008/633/JHA took effect should be maintained as set out in Article 1 of Decision 2013/392/EU.
CONTENT: the Council implementing Decision provides that Decision 2008/633/JHA shall take effect from 1 September 2013, as set out in
Article 1 of Decision 2013/392/EU.
Decision 2013/392/EU shall cease to produce effects from the date of entry into force of this Decision, without prejudice to the date of effect of
the proposed Decision.
Given that this Decision constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein
shall participate in the application of this Decision.
Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Decision but it may, within a period of six months after the Council has decided on this
Decision, decide whether it will implement it in its national law.
The United Kingdom and Ireland shall not participate in the adoption of the Decision and shall not be bound by it or subject to its application.

2015/0807(CNS) - 06/10/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs adopted, in the framework of a special legislative procedure (Parliaments
consultation), the report by Timothy KIRKHOPE (ECR, UK) on the draft Council Implementing Decision fixing the date of effect of Decision
2008/633/JHA concerning access for consultation of the Visa Information System (VIS) by designated authorities of Member States and by
Europol for the purposes of the prevention, detection and investigation of terrorist offences and of other serious criminal offences.
The committee recommended Parliament to approve the Commission proposal without amendment.
The proposal seeks to fix the date of effect of Decision 2008/633/JHA concerning access for consultation of the Visa Information System (VIS)
by designated authorities of Member States and by Europol, given that all the requisite conditions have been met.

To recall, the proposed Decision aims to replace Council Decision 2013/392/EU, which was annulled by a judgment of the Court of Justice of
the European Union. In that judgment, the Court maintained the effects of Decision 2013/392/EU until the entry into force of a new act
intended to replace it.

2015/0807(CNS) - 14/10/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 543 votes to 37, with 54 abstentions, in the framework of a special legislative procedure (Parliaments
consultation), a legislative resolution on the draft Council Implementing Decision fixing the date of effect of Decision 2008/633/JHA concerning
access for consultation of the Visa Information System (VIS) by designated authorities of Member States and by Europol for the purposes of
the prevention, detection and investigation of terrorist offences and of other serious criminal offences.
Parliament approved the Commission proposal without amendment which aims to fix the date of effect of Decision 2008/633/JHA.
The proposed Decision aims to replace Council Decision 2013/392/EU, which was annulled by a judgment of the Court of Justice of the
European Union (the Court maintained the effects of Decision 2013/392/EU).
