2015/2298(BUD) - 06/11/2015 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: to mobilise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in order to assist Finland in dealing with redundancies in its
information technology (ICT) sector.
PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
CONTENT: Article 12 of Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 laying down the multiannual financial framework for the years
2014-2020 provides that the EGF is not to exceed a maximum annual amount of EUR 150 million (2011 prices).
The rules applicable to financial contributions from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) are laid down in Regulation (EU) No
1309/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (2014-2020) and repealing
Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006.
In this context, the Commission has assessed the application for the mobilisation of the EGF in order to assist Finland, and has concluded as
follows:
Finland: EGF/2015/005 FI/Computer Programming: in June 2015, Finland submitted an application EGF/2015/005 FI/Computer programming
for a financial contribution from the EGF, following redundancies in the economic sector classified under the NACE Revision 2 Division 62
(Computer programming, consultancy and related activities) in the NUTS3 level 2 regions of Länsi-Suomi (FI19), Helsinki-Uusimaa (FI1B),
Etelä-Suomi (FI1C) and Pohjois- ja Itä-Suomi (FI1D) in Finland. These regions, taken together, comprise all of Finland with the exception of
the island of Åland.
Finland submitted its application within the 12 weeks set out in the Regulation. The deadline within which the Commission should finalise its
assessment of the application's compliance with the conditions for providing a financial contribution expires on 13 November 2015.
In order to establish the link between the redundancies and major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation, Finland
argues that, in recent years, the distribution of ICT sector employment between the EU and other economies has developed to the detriment of

the EU. While the volume of this domain has been increasing globally, it has dropped in Europe as businesses and services are moved to
China, India, Taiwan and other non-European destinations. In 2014 alone, the personnel of Finnish ICT companies was reduced by 3 per cent
or 1 500 people.
These effects were particularly felt in Finland, where the entire Finnish electronics industry was severely affected, culminating in Nokia's
announcement in 2011 of large-scale redundancies.
The software business is a global business, and software products are purchased globally from the most cost-effective sources. An important
feature of the global software industry is that it constantly requires a new, educated workforce, as the life cycle of products and related
software solutions is very short compared to the life cycle of its personnel. While in 2008, the technology industry employed a total of 326 000
people in Finland, the number of people employed by such companies in 2014 was 276 000.
To date, the Computer programming, consultancy and related activities sector has been the subject of two EGF applications, one based on
globalisation and the other on the economic and financial crisis (EGF/2011/016/Agile and the current application).
Eligibility of the application: Finland submitted the application under the intervention criteria of Article 4(1)(b) of the EGF Regulation, which
requires at least 500 workers being made redundant over a reference period of nine months in enterprises operating in the same economic
sector defined at NACE Revision 2 Division and located in one region or two contiguous regions defined at NUTS 2 level in a Member State.
The reference period for the application runs from 30 July 2014 to 30 April 2015.
The redundancies during the reference period have been calculated as follows:
1 218 from the date of the employer's individual notice to lay off or to terminate the contract of employment of the worker;
385 from the date of the de facto termination of the contract of employment or its expiry.
Accordingly, the total number of eligible beneficiaries is 1 603.
With regard to the application, it is proposed that the EGF contribute the amount of EUR 2 623 200.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: having examined the application in respect of the conditions set out in Article 13(1) of the EGF Regulation, and
having taken into account the number of targeted beneficiaries, the proposed actions and the estimated costs, the Commission proposes to
mobilise the EGF for the amount of EUR 2 623 200, representing 60 % of the total costs of the proposed actions, in order to provide a financial
contribution for the application.
The proposed decision to mobilise the EGF will be taken jointly by the European Parliament and the Council, as laid down in point 13 of the
Interinstitutional Agreement of 2 December 2013 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline,
on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management.
At the same time as it presents this proposal for a decision to mobilise the EGF, the Commission will present to the European Parliament and
to the Council a proposal for a transfer to the relevant budgetary line for the amount of EUR 442 293.
Furthermore, at the same time as it adopts this proposal for a decision to mobilise the EGF, the Commission will adopt a decision on a
financial contribution, by means of an implementing act, which will enter into force on the date on which the European Parliament and the
Council adopt the proposed decision to mobilise the EGF.

2015/2298(BUD) - 10/12/2015 Budgetary report tabled for plenary, 1st reading
The Committee on Budgets adopted the report by Marco ZANNI (EFDD, IT) on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of
the Council on mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, for an amount of EUR 2 623 200 in commitment and payment
appropriations in order to assist Finland in dealing with redundancies in its information technology (ICT) sector.
Members recalled that the Union set up legislative and budgetary instruments to provide additional support to workers who are suffering from
the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns or of the global financial and economic crisis and to assist their
reintegration into the labour market.
Finnish application: Finland submitted application EGF/2015/005 FI/Computer Programming for a financial contribution from the EGF following
1 603 redundancies in 69 enterprises operating in the NACE Rev. 2 division 62 ('Computer programming, consultancy and related activities') in
several NUTS level 2 regions covering the whole of Finland. An estimated 1 200 redundant workers are expected to participate in the
measures.
Given that the conditions set out in point (b) of Article 4(1) of the EGF Regulation are met, Finland is entitled to a financial contribution for the
workers made redundant.
Nature of the redundancies: Members noted that in recent years the distribution of ICT sector employment between the Union and other
economies has developed to the detriment of the Union and underlined that while in 2008, the technology industry employed a total of 326 000
people in Finland, the number of people employed by such companies in 2014 was 276 000, which corresponds to an average decline per
year of about 3%. The events giving rise to these redundancies are the developments affecting Nokia in recent years. They stated that
developing and designing operating systems for Nokia mobile phones used to employ thousands of Finnish people and these functions have
now been transferred to countries outside Europe. These redundancies will further aggravate the unemployment situation in the ICT sector in
regions struggling with a high unemployment rate.
Members noted that redundancies in the ICT sector are affecting particularly the Oulu region in Northern Ostrobothnia where ICT sector has
been a mainstay of the economy for years. They regretted that in spring 2015, there were approximately 1 500 unemployed jobseekers in the
ICT sector in Northern Ostrobothnia and that in many cases unemployment has become prolonged as one third of unemployed people with a
higher education degree have been without work for more than a year.
A package of personalised services: Members welcomed the fact that, in order to provide workers with speedy assistance, the Finnish
authorities decided to initiate the implementation of the personalised services to the affected workers on 1 August 2014, well ahead of the
decision on the granting the EGF support for the proposed coordinated package.

Members noted that Finland is planning seven types of measures for redundant workers covered by this application:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.

coaching measures and other preparatory measures,
employment and business services,
training,
pay subsidies,
start-up grants,
steering towards entrepreneurship and services for new entrepreneurs,
allowances for travel, overnight and removal costs.

They welcomed the measures supporting entrepreneurship, in the form of start-up grants and measures steering towards entrepreneurship
and services for new entrepreneurs. They considered that these measures will be more useful if they are provided in combination to the
participants. They pointed out that a pay subsidy should preferably be provided to the dismissed workers only when the jobs offered to the
participants comply with the adequate quality requirements in terms of skill level and duration of contract.
They noted that the authorities estimate that 18.31% of the costs will be used for allowances and incentives, which remains much below the
maximum allowed 35% of all costs.
Appropriate and complementary measures: Members asked the Commission to further detail, in future proposals, the sectors in which the
workers are likely to find employment and if the training on offer is aligned to the future economic prospects and labour market needs in the
regions concerned by the dismissals.
They expected the Commission to oversee and evaluate the use of the money granted and to use this information in future applications to
further direct the use of EGF to align it with ideas of performance based budgeting.
Lastly, Members noted that the Finnish authorities confirm that the eligible actions do not receive assistance from other Union financial
instruments.

2015/2298(BUD) - 15/12/2015 Budgetary text adopted by Parliament
The European Parliament adopted by 597 votes to 83, with 13 abstentions, a resolution on the proposal for a decision of the European
Parliament and of the Council on mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, for an amount of EUR 2 623 200 in commitment
and payment appropriations in order to assist Finland in dealing with redundancies in its information technology (ICT) sector.
Parliament recalled that the Union set up legislative and budgetary instruments to provide additional support to workers who are suffering from

measures steering towards entrepreneurship and services for new entrepreneurs. It considered that these measures will be more useful if they
are provided in combination to the participants. It welcomed in particular the proposed measures which aim at creating new businesses and
which will foster entrepreneurship and services for new entrepreneurs.
It recalled that, in line with the EGF Regulation, the design of the coordinated package of personalised services supported by the EGF should
anticipate future labour market perspectives and required skills and should be compatible with the shift towards a resource-efficient and
sustainable economy.
Appropriate and complementary measures: Parliament asked the Commission to further detail, in future proposals, the sectors in which the
workers are likely to find employment and if the training on offer is aligned to the future economic prospects and labour market needs in the
regions concerned by the dismissals.

2015/2298(BUD) - 16/12/2015 Final act
PURPOSE: to mobilise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in order to assist Finland in dealing with redundancies in its
information technology (ICT) sector.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision (EU) 2015/2457 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the mobilisation of the European
Globalisation Adjustment Fund (application from Finland EGF/2015/005 FI/Computer Programming).
CONTENT: with this Decision, the European Parliament and the Council have decided to mobilise the sum of EUR 2 623 200 in commitment
and payment appropriations from European Globalisation Adjustment Fund within the framework of the 2015 budget.
This amount aims to obtain a financial contribution from the EGF following redundancies in the economic sector classified under the NACE
Revision 2 Division 62 (Computer programming, consultancy and related activities) in the NUTS level 2 regions of Länsi-Suomi (FI19),
Helsinki-Uusimaa (FI1B), Etelä-Suomi (FI1C) and Pohjois- ja Itä-Suomi (FI1D) in Finland.
Given that this application complies with the requirements for determining the financial contributions as laid down in Regulation No 1309/2013
(EGF Regulation 2014-2020), the European Parliament and Council have decided to grant the above-mentioned amount.
The application was considered admissible since the redundancies have a serious impact on employment and the local, regional or national
economy. Ireland has also decided to provide personalised services co-financed by the EGF also to 108 young persons not in employment,
education or training (NEETs).
To recall, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) aims to provide support for workers made redundant and self-employed persons
whose activity has ceased as a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation, as a result of a continuation of
the global financial and economic crisis, or as a result of a new global financial and economic crisis, and to assist them with their reintegration
into the labour market.
Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 laying down the multiannual financial framework for the years 2014-2020, allows mobilization
of the EGF upto a maximum annual amount of EUR 150 million.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 16.12.2015.
