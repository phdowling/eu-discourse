2015/2228(INI) - 26/04/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Womens Rights and Gender Equality adopted the own-initiative report by Maria ARENA (S&D, BE) on poverty: a gender
perspective.
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, exercising its powers as associated committee under Rule 54 of the Rules of Procedure,
was also consulted and gave an opinion on this report.
The latest Eurostat data show that the number of women in poverty remains permanently higher than that of men, with currently some 64.6
million women as against 57.6 million men. Women were particularly affected by the risk of poverty in the EU-28 in 2014, with the rate
standing at 46.6% before social transfers and 17.7% after such transfers. Regardless of how specific the groups at risk are, such as elderly
women, single women, single mothers, lesbians, bisexual women, transgender women and women with disabilities, poverty rates among
migrant women and women from ethnic minorities are the same throughout the EU. Furthermore, single-parent families are at greater risk of
poverty or social exclusion (49.8 % compared with 25.2% of average households with dependent children, with, however, differences between
Member States.
Members also recalled that the austerity policies requested by the Commission and implemented by the Members States, in addition to the
economic crisis of the past few years, have widened inequalities and affected women in particular.
Poverty and work-life balance: recalling the crucial role of high-quality public services in combating poverty, especially female poverty,
Members considered that Member States should prioritise the issue of reconciling private and professional life by introducing family-friendly
working arrangements, such as adaptable working hours and the possibility of teleworking.
Deploring the austerity policies being pursued by the EU, the committee called on the Member States and the Commission to develop and use
the available policy and financial instruments, including the Social Investment Package (the European Social Fund (ESF) and the European
Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI).

It asked the Commission, in close coordination with the Member States, to undertake a comprehensive and global legislative initiative with a
view to meeting the needs of mothers and fathers concerning the different types of leave, namely maternity, paternity, parental and carers
leave, in particular in order to help men play an active role as fathers. Members reiterated their disappointment at the withdrawal of the
maternity leave directive and called for a move towards the individualisation of rights in social equity policy.
Poverty and work: Members called on the Commission and the Member States to implement policies to promote the employment of women
and the integration into the labour market of socially marginalised groups of women. They called particularly for the development of affordable
and high-quality public care services, adaptable but not precarious working-time arrangements that benefit both women and men. Noting that
women are more often employed in precarious and low-paid work and on non-standard employment contracts, the committee called on
Member States to step up their efforts to combat undeclared work, precarious jobs and the abuse of atypical forms of contract, including
zero-hour contracts in some Member States. They pointed out that there are new categories of women in poverty, consisting of young
professional women, especially in certain Member States whose tax policies do not take into account the difficulties encountered by these
categories, (the 'new poor').
Members reiterated their call on the Commission to revise the existing legislation in order to close the gender pay gap and reduce the pension
gap between men and women and recommend a definition of work of equal value, taking into account ECJ case law, in order to ensure that
factors such as working conditions, the responsibility conferred on workers and the physical or mental requirements of the work concerned are
taken into account.
Poverty: general recommendations: Members made a series of recommendations for fighting poverty amongst women:
develop support schemes and social pricing for the most deprived in society, particularly in regard to water and power supplies;
combat gender stereotypes, empowering women and girls in the social, economic, cultural and political fields;
actively promote a positive image of mothers as employees and to combat the phenomenon of the motherhood penalty as identified
by a number of research studies;
ensure that the structural and investment funds, are used to improve education and training with a view to improving labour market
access and combating unemployment, poverty and social exclusion of women;
incentivise the achievement of equal representation in areas where there is a gender imbalance;
take urgent measures in the field of migrant education both at EU and national levels, bearing in mind that education is key to
integration and employability;
ensure that all young people have access to high-quality free public education at all ages, including early childhood;
ensure equal treatment legislation to combat poverty resulting from marginalisation and discrimination affecting sexual and gender
minorities;
take additional measures to support divorced women prone to discrimination and poverty;
promote best practice on taxation policies that takes gender impact into account and furthers gender equality;
include gender-specific considerations when designing a guideline reference budget;
ensure determined efforts to combat domestic violence, particularly against women;
improve the quality of life of women in rural areas;
improve womens access to culture and social participation;
take specific measures to help disabled women;
strive towards establishing a European Child Guarantee that will ensure that every European child at risk of poverty has access to free
healthcare, free education, free childcare, decent housing and adequate nutrition;
introduce new individual indicators in respect of women and poverty, as a tool to monitor the impact of broader social, economic and
employment policies on women.
At the same time, Members asked the Commission and Member States to create stakeholder engagement processes that promote and
facilitate the direct engagement of persons at risk of poverty and social inclusion, particularly women and girls, in policy-making on social
inclusion at all levels. NGOs which operate successfully in areas afflicted by extreme poverty should be mobilised as should social partners
(trade unions and employers) and civil society.

2015/2228(INI) - 26/05/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 325 votes to 104, with 206 abstentions, a resolution on poverty: a gender perspective.
Parliament recalled that the latest Eurostat data show that the number of women in poverty remains permanently higher than that of men, with
currently some 64.6 million women as against 57.6 million men. Women were particularly affected by the risk of poverty in the EU-28 in 2014,
with the rate standing at 46.6% before social transfers and 17.7% after such transfers. Regardless of how specific the groups at risk are, such
as elderly women, single women, single mothers, lesbians, bisexual women, transgender women and women with disabilities, poverty rates
among migrant women and women from ethnic minorities are the same throughout the EU. Furthermore, single-parent families are at greater
risk of poverty or social exclusion (49.8 % compared with 25.2% of average households with dependent children, with, however, differences
between Member States.
Poverty and work-life balance: Parliament considered that Member States should prioritise the issue of reconciling private and professional life
by introducing family-friendly working arrangements, such as adaptable working hours and the possibility of teleworking. It also noted that the
lack of affordable high-quality childcare, care for dependent persons and the elderly, and in particular of crèches, nursery schools and
long-term care facilities, contributes to social exclusion, the gender employment gap, the pay gap and the related pension gap.
Parliament also recalled that the austerity policies requested by the Commission and implemented by the Members States, in addition to the
economic crisis of the past few years, have widened inequalities and affected women in particular. Parliament called on the Member States
and the Commission to develop and use the available policy and financial instruments, including the Social Investment Package (the European
Social Fund (ESF) and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI).
Parental leave and maternity leave: Parliament called on the Commission, in close coordination with the Member States, to undertake a
comprehensive legislative initiative with a view to meeting the needs of mothers and fathers concerning the different types of leave , namely
maternity, paternity, parental and carers leave, in particular in order to help men play an active role as fathers, enabling a fairer distribution of
family responsibilities and thus allowing women equal opportunities to participate in the labour market. It called on the Member States to

envisage legislation to safeguard or enhance maternity, paternity and parental rights. It underlined the fact that in 2010 only 2.7 % of persons
using their right of parental leave were men, which points up the need for concrete action to ensure parental leave rights.
Parliament reiterated its disappointment at the withdrawal of the maternity leave directive and called on the Commission to put forward a new
proposal and a mandatory right to paid paternity leave.
Poverty and work: Parliament called on the Commission and the Member States to implement policies to promote the employment of women
and the integration into the labour market of socially marginalised groups of women. It called particularly for the development of affordable and
high-quality public care services, adaptable but not precarious working-time arrangements that benefit both women and men.
It stressed the crucial importance of: reforming macroeconomic, social and labour market policies by aligning these with gender equality
policies in order to guarantee economic and social justice for women and reconsidering the methods used to determine the poverty rate and
developing strategies to promote the fair distribution of wealth.
Noting that women are more often employed in precarious and low-paid work and on non-standard employment contracts, Parliament called
on Member States to step up their efforts to combat undeclared work, precarious jobs and the abuse of atypical forms of contract, including
zero-hour contracts in some Member States.
Members pointed out that there are new categories of women in poverty, consisting of young professional women, especially in certain
Member States whose tax policies do not take into account the difficulties encountered by these categories, and which therefore condemn a
large proportion of young female graduates to a precarious working life and an income that rarely manages to rise above the poverty line (the
'new poor').
Gender pay gaps: once again, Parliament called on the Commission to revise the existing legislation in order to close the gender pay gap and
reduce the pension gap between men and women. It recalled that the gender pay gap stands at 16.3 %, and the atypical and uncertain forms
of work contracts (zero-hours contracts, temporary work, interim jobs, part-time working) also affect women more than men.
It welcomed the fact that the Commission considers 'equal pay for work of equal value' to be one of the key areas for action in its new strategy
for gender equality. It called, therefore, on the Commission to adopt a Communication for a New Strategy for Gender Equality and Women's
Rights post 2015, so that the objectives and policies included can be effectively implemented.
Pensions: Parliament called on the Commission to carry out an impact assessment of minimum income schemes in the EU, and to consider
further steps that would take into account the economic and social circumstances of each Member State. It called once again on the Member
States to introduce a minimum national pension which cannot be lower than the risk-of-poverty threshold.
It should be noted that retired women are the most vulnerable group and often live in or are at risk of poverty. It called on the Member States to
reform pension systems with the aim of always ensuring adequate pensions for all with a view to closing the pension gap. It also called on the
Member States to consider providing shared pension rights in cases of divorce and legal separation, in line with the principle of subsidiarity. It
emphasised that the Court of Justice of the European Union has made it clear that occupational pension schemes are to be regarded as pay
and that the principle of equal treatment therefore applies to these schemes as well.
Poverty: general recommendations: Parliament made a series of recommendations for fighting poverty amongst women:
develop support schemes and social pricing for the most deprived in society, particularly in regard to water and power supplies;
combat gender stereotypes, empowering women and girls in the social, economic, cultural and political fields;
actively promote a positive image of mothers as employees and to combat the phenomenon of the motherhood penalty as identified
by a number of research studies;
ensure that the structural and investment funds, are used to improve education and training with a view to improving labour market
access and combating unemployment, poverty and social exclusion of women;
incentivise the achievement of equal representation in areas where there is a gender imbalance;
take urgent measures in the field of migrant education both at EU and national levels, bearing in mind that education is key to
integration and employability;
ensure that all young people have access to high-quality free public education at all ages, including early childhood;
ensure equal treatment legislation to combat poverty resulting from marginalisation and discrimination affecting sexual and gender
minorities;
take additional measures to support divorced women prone to discrimination and poverty;
include gender-specific considerations when designing a guideline reference budget;
sign and ratify the Istanbul Convention, and asks for an urgent initiative in order to establish an EU directive on combating violence
against women;
present a European strategy against gender-based violence;
improve the quality of life of women in rural areas;
provide the support necessary to ensure that all women can enjoy the right to culture, sport, and leisure, paying particular attention to
women living in poverty;
take specific measures to help disabled women;
provide more ambitious action to tackle energy poverty;
strive towards establishing a European Child Guarantee that will ensure that every European child at risk of poverty has access to free
healthcare, free education, free childcare, decent housing and adequate nutrition;
collect gender-disaggregated statistics and to introduce new individual indicators in respect of women and poverty.
At the same time, Parliament asked the Commission and Member States to create stakeholder engagement processes that promote and
facilitate the direct engagement of persons at risk of poverty and social inclusion, particularly women and girls, in policy-making on social
inclusion at all levels. NGOs which operate successfully in areas afflicted by extreme poverty should be mobilised as should social partners
(trade unions and employers) and civil society. Lastly, Parliament called on the Commission and the Member States to implement gender
budgeting as a tool.
