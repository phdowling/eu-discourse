PURPOSE: to propose a connected Digital Single Market Strategy for Europe.
BACKGROUND: the global economy is rapidly becoming digital. These changes are happening at a scale and speed that bring immense
opportunities for innovation, growth and jobs.
Against this background, all Member States are wrestling with similar problems but on a national basis which is too limited to allow them to
seize all the opportunities and deal with all the challenges of this transformational change. For many issues the European level offers the right
framework. That is why the European Commission has set the creation of a Digital Single Market as one of its key priorities.
Europe has the capabilities to lead in the global digital economy but we are currently not making the most of them. Fragmentation and barriers
that do not exist in the physical Single Market are holding the EU back. Bringing down these barriers within Europe could contribute an
additional EUR 415 billion to European GDP. The digital economy can:
expand markets and foster better services at better prices,
offer more choice and create new sources of employment,
create opportunities for new start-ups and allow existing companies to grow and profit from the scale of a market of over 500 million
people.
CONTENT: this Strategy has a multi-annual scope and is focused on key interdependent actions that can only be taken at EU level . They have
been chosen to have maximum impact, can be delivered during the Juncker Commission's mandate.
The Digital Single Market Strategy will be built on three pillars:
PILLAR 1: Better access for consumers and businesses to online goods and services across Europe: this requires the rapid removal of key
differences between the online and offline worlds to break down barriers to cross-border online activity.
1. Cross-border e-commerce rules: only 7% of SMEs in the EU sell cross-border. If the same rules for e-commerce were applied in
all EU Member States, 57% of companies say they would either start or increase their online sales to other EU Member States.
The Commission will make an amended proposal before the end of 2015 (i) covering harmonised EU rules for online purchases of
digital content, and (ii) allowing traders to rely on their national laws based on a focused set of key mandatory EU contractual rights
for domestic and cross-border online sales of tangible goods. The Commission will also submit a proposal for a review of the
Regulation on Consumer Protection Cooperation in order to develop more efficient cooperation mechanisms.
2. Affordable high-quality cross-border parcel delivery: for companies that currently do not sell online but are trying to do so, 62% say
the fact that delivery costs are too high is a problem. The Commission will launch measures in the first half of 2016 to improve price
transparency and enhance regulatory oversight of parcel delivery.
3. Preventing unjustified geo-blocking: geo-blocking refers to practices used for commercial reasons by online sellers that result in
the denial of access to websites based in other Member States. Geo-blocking is one of several tools used by companies to segment
markets along national borders (territorial restrictions). By limiting consumer opportunities and choice, geo-blocking is a significant
cause of consumer dissatisfaction and of fragmentation of the Internal Market.
The Commission will make legislative proposals in the first half of 2016 to end unjustified geo-blocking. Action could include targeted
change to the e-Commerce framework and the framework set out by Article 20 of the Services Directive.
Furthermore, the Commission will review the satellite and cable directive to assess the need to enlarge its scope to broadcasters'
online transmissions and the need to tackle further measures to ensure enhanced cross-border access to broadcasters' services in
Europe.
4. A modern, more European copyright framework: 56% of Europeans use the internet for cultural purposes and spending on digital
entertainment and media is predicted to see double digit growth rates (around 12%) for the next five years.
Barriers to cross-border access to copyright-protected content services and their portability are still common, particularly for
audiovisual programmes.
The Commission will make legislative proposals before the end of 2015 to reduce the differences between national copyright
regimes and allow for wider online access to works by users across the EU, including through further harmonisation measures.
Europe needs a more harmonised copyright regime which provides incentives to create and invest while allowing transmission and
consumption of content across borders, building on our rich cultural diversity.
5. Reducing VAT related burdens and obstacles when selling across borders: an EU business wishing to make cross-border sales
faces a VAT compliance cost of at least EUR 5,000 annually for each targeted Member State.
The Commission will make legislative proposals in 2016 to reduce the administrative burden on businesses arising from different
VAT regimes including (i) extending the current single electronic registration and payment mechanism to intra-EU and 3rd country
online sales of tangible goods, (ii) introducing a common EU-wide simplification measure (VAT threshold) to help small start-up
e-commerce businesses.
PILLAR 2: Creating the right conditions for digital networks and services to flourish: this requires high-speed, secure and trustworthy
infrastructures and content services, supported by the right regulatory conditions for innovation, investment, fair competition and a level playing
field.
The Commission intends to:
1. present proposals in 2016 for an ambitious overhaul of the telecoms regulatory framework focusing on (i) a consistent single
market approach to spectrum policy and management; (ii) delivering the conditions for a true single market; (iii) ensuring a level
playing field for market players and consistent application of the rules; (iv) incentivising investment in high speed broadband
networks (including a review of the Universal Service Directive).
2. A media framework for the 21st century: the Commission will review the Audiovisual Media Services Directive with a focus on its
scope and on the nature of the rules applicable to all market players, in particular measures for the promotion of European works,
and the rules on protection of minors and advertising rules.

3. Analyse the role of online platforms (e.g. search engines, social media, e-commerce platforms, app stores, etc): certain online
platforms are playing an ever more central role in social and economic life: they enable consumers to find online information and
businesses to exploit the advantages of ecommerce.
The Commission will launch before the end of 2015 a comprehensive assessment of the role of platforms, including in the sharing
economy, and of online intermediaries. It will cover issues such as how best to tackle illegal content on the Internet.
4. Reinforcing trust and security in digital services and in the handling of personal data: only 22% of Europeans have full trust in
companies such as search engines, social networking sites and e-mail services. In the first half of 2016, the Commission will initiate
the establishment a Public-Private Partnership on cybersecurity in the area of technologies and solutions for online network security.
Once the new EU rules on data protection are adopted, which should be by the end of 2015, the Commission will review the
ePrivacy Directive.
PILLAR 3: Maximising the growth potential of our European Digital Economy: this requires investment in ICT infrastructures and technologies
such as Cloud computing and Big Data, and research and innovation to boost industrial competiveness as well as better public services,
inclusiveness and skills.
The Commission intends to:
1. propose in 2016 a European Free flow of data initiative that tackles restrictions on the free movement of data for reasons other
than the protection of personal data within the EU and unjustified restrictions on the location of data for storage or processing
purposes;
2. launch an integrated standardisation plan to identify and define key priorities for standardisation with a focus on the technologies
and domains that are deemed to be critical to the Digital Single Market, including essential sectoral interoperability and standards in
areas such as health (telemedicine, m-health), transport (travel planning, efreight), environment, and energy;
3. support an inclusive Digital Single Market in which citizens and businesses have the necessary skills and can benefit from
interlinked and multi-lingual eservices, from e-government, e-justice, e-health, e-energy or e-transport. The Commission will: (i)
address digital skills and expertise as a key component of its future initiatives on skills and training; (ii) present a new e-Government
Action Plan 2016-2020.

2015/2147(INI) - 21/12/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Industry, Research and Energy adopted, jointly with the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, the
own-initiative report presented by Kaja KALLAS (ALDE, FI) and Evelyne GEBHARDT (S&D, DE), entitled Towards a Digital Single Market Act,
as a follow-up to the digital single market strategy for Europe presented by the Commission.
The Committees on Employment and Social Affairs, Culture and Education, Legal Affairs, Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, exercising
their prerogatives as an associated committee under Parliaments Rule 54 of the Rules of Procedure were consulted to give an opinion on the
report.
The need for a digital single market: the report stated that Europe must use the great potential of the information and communications
technology (ICT) sector to digitise the industry and maintain global competitiveness. It called on the Commission to identify and dismantle
barriers affecting e-commerce in order to build a genuine cross-border e-commerce market.
Cross-border e-commerce rules that consumers and business can trust: Members welcomed the Commission's undertaking to adopt a strong
proposal on online contracts covering digital content purchased online and to improve consumers' legal protection in this sphere. The report
noted that the Commission is planning a Regulatory Fitness and Performance Programme (REFIT) of the whole consumers acquis for 2016.
The Commission is also called upon to assess the feasibility, usefulness and potential opportunities and weaknesses created by the
introduction of sector-specific EU trustmarks for online sales as well as to work towards the timely and correct implementation of the EU-wide
online dispute resolution (ODR) Regulation.
Affordable high-quality cross-border parcel delivery: the report noted that accessible, affordable, efficient and high-quality delivery services are
an essential prerequisite for thriving cross-border e-commerce. It called on the Commission and the Member States to actively share best
practices in the parcel delivery sector, and to propose a comprehensive action plan, including guidelines for best practices, in cooperation with
operators, to find innovative solutions to improve services, lower costs and the environmental impact, and to propose if necessary a revision of
the relevant legislation.
Preventing unjustified geo-blocking: the report considered that ambitious, targeted actions are needed to improve access to goods and
services, in particular by ending unjustified geo-blocking practices and unfair price discrimination based on geographical location or nationality
which often have the effect of building monopolies and of consumers resorting to illegal content. Members welcomed the Commissions
proposal to enhance portability and interoperability in order to stimulate the free circulation of legally acquired, and legally available, content or
services, as a first step towards bringing an end to unjustified geo-blocking.
Reducing VAT-related burdens and obstacles when selling across borders: Members stressed that in order to prevent market distortion, tax
avoidance and tax evasion and to create a true European Digital Single Market, more coordination on taxation is needed, requiring inter alia
the establishment of an EU-wide Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB). In this regard, they welcomed the adoption of the
review of the payment services directive and stressed that if the Union is to enhance EU-wide e-commerce, pan-EU instant e-/m-payments
under a common standard and the appropriate implementation of the review of the payment services directive must be achieved without delay.
Role of online platforms: the Commission is urged to examine whether potential issues related to online platforms could be resolved by proper
and full implementation of existing legislation and effective enforcement of EU competition law in order to ensure a level playing field and fair
and effective competition between online platforms and to avoid the creation of monopolies. Members also called on the Commission and the
Member States to support the further development of the sharing economy by identifying artificial barriers and relevant legislation hindering its
growth.
Reinforcing trust and security in digital networks: a harmonised response from the EU and its Member States with a view to ensuring a high

level of network and information security is needed. Members stated that providing security on the internet entails the protection of networks
and critical infrastructure, ensuring the ability of law enforcement agencies to fight crime, including terrorism, violent radicalisation and sexual
abuse and sexual exploitation of children online. Security, together with protection of fundamental rights in cyberspace, is crucial to reinforcing
trust in digital services and is therefore a necessary basis for establishing a competitive digital single market.
Building a data economy: Members emphasised the opportunities that new ICT technologies such as Big Data, cloud computing, 3D-printing
and other technologies can bring to the economy and society. They also highlighted the opportunities offered by energy sector digitalisation,
with smart meters, smart grids and data hubs for more efficient and flexible energy production.
Digital skills and expertise: highlighting that the mismatch between supply and demand with regard to skills is a problem for the development of
the digital economy, Members called on the Commission, as a matter of urgency, to develop a skills strategy which can tackle this shortage.
They proposed using appropriations from the Youth Employment Initiative to support associations (grassroots movements) which teach
disadvantaged young people digital skills. Media and internet literacy should also be promoted.
E-government: Members stated that the development of e-administration is a priority for innovation. They urged the Commission to lead by
example in the field of e-government and to develop, together with the Member States, an ambitious and comprehensive e-government action
plan based on the once only principle, whereby citizens and businesses should not be asked for information already provided to a public
authority, whilst ensuring citizens' privacy and a high level of data protection.

2015/2147(INI) - 19/01/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 551 votes to 88, with 39 abstentions, a resolution entitled Towards a Digital Single Market Act, as a
follow-up to the digital single market strategy for Europe presented by the Commission.
The need for a digital single market: whilst welcoming the Commission communication, Parliament considered that achieving a Digital Single
Market, based on a common set of rules, could foster EU competitiveness, have positive effects on growth and jobs, relaunch the Single
Market and make society more inclusive, offering new opportunities to citizens and businesses, especially by exchanging and sharing
innovation. Noting that 75 % of the value added by the digital economy comes from traditional industry, Parliament called on Europe to use the
great potential of the information and communications technology (ICT) sector to digitise the industry and maintain global competitiveness.
It called on the Commission to:
identify and dismantle barriers affecting e-commerce in order to build a genuine cross-border e-commerce market e-commerce
generates EUR 500 billion per year in the European Union - in order to build a genuine cross-border e-commerce market;
promote a more dynamic economy that allows innovation to flourish and removes barriers for businesses, in particular innovative
ones, SMEs, start-ups and scale-ups, so that they can access markets in a level playing field.
Cross-border e-commerce rules that consumers and business can trust: Parliament welcomed the Commission's undertaking to adopt a strong
proposal on online contracts covering digital content purchased online and to improve consumers' legal protection in this sphere. It agreed that
consumers should enjoy an equivalent and future-proof level of protection regardless of whether they purchase digital content online or offline.
It emphasised that this should be done in a technology-neutral manner and not impose unreasonable costs for business.
Members requested an Active Consumers strategy to assess in particular whether consumer switching is facilitated in the online world, and
whether action is needed to make consumer switching easier, in order to boost competition in online markets. It also called on the Commission
to assess the feasibility, usefulness and potential opportunities and weaknesses created by the introduction of sector-specific EU trustmarks
for online sales as well as to work towards the timely and correct implementation of the EU-wide online dispute resolution (ODR) Regulation.
Affordable high-quality cross-border parcel delivery: Parliament the report noted that accessible, affordable, efficient and high-quality delivery
services are an essential prerequisite for thriving cross-border e-commerce. It called on the Commission and the Member States to actively
share best practices in the parcel delivery sector, and to propose a comprehensive action plan, to find innovative solutions to improve services,
to further integrate the single market for parcel delivery an52d postal services, to dismantle barriers postal operators encounter in cross-border
delivery, and to propose if necessary a revision of the relevant legislation.
Preventing unjustified geo-blocking: in this regard, Parliament:
called for ambitious, targeted actions to improve access to goods and services, in particular by ending unjustified geo-blocking
practices and unfair price discrimination based on geographical location or nationality which often have the effect of building
monopolies and of consumers resorting to illegal content;
welcomed the Commissions proposal to enhance portability and interoperability in order to stimulate the free circulation of legally
acquired, and legally available, content or services, as a first step towards bringing an end to unjustified geo-blocking;
pointed out the importance of the ongoing competition sector inquiry into the e-commerce sector in order to investigate, inter alia,
whether unjustified geo-blocking restrictions, such as discrimination on the basis of IP address, postal address or the country of issue
of credit cards, infringe the rules of EU competition law.
Parliament also welcomed the Commission's commitment to modernise the current copyright framework to adapt it to the digital age.
Reducing VAT-related burdens and obstacles when selling across borders: Parliament stressed that in order to prevent market distortion, tax
avoidance and tax evasion and to create a true European Digital Single Market, more coordination on taxation is needed, requiring inter alia
the establishment of an EU-wide Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB). In this regard, it welcomed the adoption of the review
of the payment services directive and stressed that if the Union is to enhance EU-wide e-commerce, pan-EU instant e-/m-payments under a
common standard and the appropriate implementation of the review of the payment services directive must be achieved without delay.
To create a fit-for-purpose regulatory environment: Parliament emphasises that private investments in fast and ultra-fast communication
networks are a requirement for any digital progress that must be incentivised by a stable EU regulatory framework enabling all players to make
investments, including in rural and remote areas. It highlighted the importance of a successful implementation of European Fund for Strategic
Investment (EFSI) to maximise investments by targeting projects with higher-risk profiles, boosting economic recovery, stimulating growth, and
incentivising private investments, inter alia microfinancing and venture capital to support innovative companies.

Role of online platforms: the Commission is urged to examine whether potential issues related to online platforms could be resolved by proper
and full implementation of existing legislation and effective enforcement of EU competition law in order to ensure a level playing field and fair
and effective competition between online platforms and to avoid the creation of monopolies. Members also called on the Commission and the
Member States to support the further development of the sharing economy and its potential for more flexible forms of employment (the
Commission is forecasting a growth potential that goes over USD 100 billion). Parliament encouraged the Commission to set up a stakeholder
group in charge of promoting best practices in the sharing economy sector.
Reinforcing trust and security in digital networks: a harmonised response from the EU and its Member States with a view to ensuring a high
level of network and information security is needed. Members stated that providing security on the internet entails the protection of networks
and critical infrastructure, ensuring the ability of law enforcement agencies to fight crime, including terrorism, violent radicalisation and sexual
abuse and sexual exploitation of children online. The Commission is called upon to advance policies and a legal framework to tackle
cybercrime and illegal content and materials on the internet.
Security, together with protection of fundamental rights in cyberspace, is crucial to reinforcing trust in digital services and is therefore a
necessary basis for establishing a competitive digital single market.
Building a data economy: Parliament emphasised the opportunities that new ICT technologies such as Big Data, cloud computing, 3D-printing
and other technologies can bring to the economy and society. It also highlighted the opportunities offered by energy sector digitalisation, with
smart meters, smart grids and data hubs for more efficient and flexible energy production.
Digital skills and expertise: highlighting that the mismatch between supply and demand with regard to skills is a problem for the development of
the digital economy, Members called on the Commission, as a matter of urgency, to develop a skills strategy which can tackle this shortage.
They proposed using appropriations from the Youth Employment Initiative to support associations (grassroots movements) which teach
disadvantaged young people digital skills. Media and internet literacy should also be promoted.
E-government: Parliament stated that the development of e-administration is a priority for innovation. It urged the Commission to lead by
example in the field of e-government and to develop, together with the Member States, an ambitious and comprehensive e-government action
plan based on the once only principle, whereby citizens and businesses should not be asked for information already provided to a public
authority, whilst ensuring citizens' privacy and a high level of data protection.
