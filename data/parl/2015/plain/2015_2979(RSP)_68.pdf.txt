Summary

2015/2979(RSP) - 17/12/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 525 votes to 42, with 39 abstentions, a resolution on the 20th anniversary of the Dayton Peace
Agreement.
The text adopted in plenary was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ECR, ALDE, GUE/NGL, Greens/EFA and EFDD groups.
Whilst remembering all of the tragic victims of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Parliament recalled that the Dayton Peace Agreement,
signed on 14 December 1995 in Paris, put an end to the bloodiest war in Europe since the Second World War. Although the Agreement ended
the war, it failed to create a functioning, self-sustainable state.
Parliament called on the authorities to use the 20th anniversary of the Dayton Peace Agreement as an incentive to move forward with the
necessary reforms especially in view of Bosnia and Herzegovinas forthcoming EU membership application. Priority should be given to:
addressing the socio-economic needs of citizens must be the priority;
establishing an effective coordination mechanism on EU matters;
continuing with constitutional and political reforms and democratisation of the political system, which will lead in the direction of
ensuring true equality and democratic representation of all three constituent peoples and all the countrys citizens.
Parliament welcomed the results achieved with the return of refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs), reconstruction and property
restitution, in line with the provisions of Annex VII to the Dayton Agreement. It insisted on the need:
for full implementation of the annex and the related strategy in order to ensure a sustainable return and also fair, comprehensive and
durable solutions for internally displaced persons, refugees and other war-affected persons;
for the sustainable return of Croats, Bosniaks and others into the Republika Srpska;
to make progress in improving the socio-economic integration of those who have returned;
for better coordination of efforts at all levels and more attention to be given to the most vulnerable displaced people, including Roma
and women victims of violence.
Lastly, Members reiterated the EUs commitment to the European perspective and the further accession process of Bosnia and Herzegovina
and of all Western Balkan countries.
