Commission response to text adopted in plenary

Summary

2015/3010(RSP) - 16/12/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a resolution opposing the draft Commission implementing regulation adopting a list of invasive alien
species of Union concern pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 1143/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council.
To recall, the Commission is to adopt, by means of implementing acts, a list of invasive alien species of Union concern (the Union list), on the
basis of the criteria laid down in Regulation (EU) No 1143/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (the IAS Regulation), and those
implementing acts are to be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure.
Parliament noted that the draft Union list fails to address the problem of invasive alien species in a comprehensive manner, so as to protect
native biodiversity and ecosystem services, as well as to minimise and mitigate the human health or economic impacts that these species
could have.
Parliament considered that the Commissions initial list has been criticised by several competent national authorities, stakeholders and the

general public, to the extent that they are now seriously doubting the future effectiveness of the IAS Regulation, mainly because many of the
most problematic invasive alien species are not listed, while some species incapable of causing a significant negative impact on biodiversity,
ecosystem services, human health or the economy, or for which the measures to be taken would result in disproportionate costs, are listed.
Members stressed the fact that the initial list overlooks species that are among the most detrimental invasive alien species in Europe and that
some terrestrial plant and mammal species comply with the criteria and a robust risk assessment is available, yet they are not included on the
list.
Therefore, Parliament considered that the draft Commission implementing regulation exceeds the implementing powers provided for in
Regulation (EU) No 1143/2014. It called on the Commission to withdraw its draft implementing regulation and to submit a new draft to the
committee.
