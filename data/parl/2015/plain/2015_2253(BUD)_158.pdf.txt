2015/2253(BUD) - 30/09/2015 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: to mobilise the Flexibility Instrument for immediate budgetary measures under the European Agenda on Migration.
PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
CONTENT: Council Regulation (EU, EURATOM) No 1311/2013 of 2 December 2013 laying down the multiannual financial framework for the
years 2014-2020 allows for the mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument to allow the financing of clearly identified expenditure which could not
be financed within the limits of the ceilings available for one or more headings of the multiannual financial framework.
Article 11 of Council Regulation 1311/2013 has established a Flexibility Instrument of up to EUR 471 million (2011 prices) per year.
After having examined all possibilities for re-allocating appropriations and exhausted any unallocated margin under the expenditure heading
Security and Citizenship (heading 3), the Commission proposes to mobilise the Flexibility Instrument. This mobilisation concerns an amount of
EUR 66.1 million beyond the ceiling of heading 3 of the multiannual financial framework, and is intended to finance support for measures for
managing the refugee crisis.
The payment appropriations corresponding to the proposed mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument are EUR 52.9 million in 2016 and EUR
13.2 million in 2017.

2015/2253(BUD) - 12/10/2015 Budgetary report tabled for plenary, 1st reading

The Committee on Budgets adopted the report by Eider GARDIAZABAL RUBIAL (S&D, ES) on the proposal for a decision of the European
Parliament and of the Council on the mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument for immediate budgetary measures under the European Agenda
on Migration, in accordance with point 12 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 2 December 2013 between the European Parliament, the
Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline, on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management.
Members recalled that the Commission proposed to mobilise the Flexibility Instrument, over and above the MFF ceilings, to complement the
financing in the general budget of the Union for the financial year 2015 by EUR 66.1 million in commitment appropriations to finance measures
for managing the refugee and migration crisis.
The 2015 ceiling for heading 3 does not allow for an adequate financing of important and urgent political priorities of the Union. Members
called on the European Parliament to agree to the proposed allocation of the corresponding payment appropriations of EUR 52.9 million in
2016 and EUR 13.2 million in 2017.
Flexibility Instrument: Members reiterated that the mobilisation of this instrument shows, once more, the crucial need for the Union budget to
be more flexible.

2015/2253(BUD) - 14/10/2015 Budgetary text adopted by Parliament
The European Parliament adopted by 573 votes to 66, with 10 abstentions, a resolution on the proposal for a decision of the European
Parliament and of the Council on the mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument for immediate budgetary measures under the European Agenda
on Migration, in accordance with point 12 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 2 December 2013 between the European Parliament, the
Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline, on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management.
Parliament recalled that the Commission proposed to mobilise the Flexibility Instrument, over and above the MFF ceilings, to complement the
financing in the general budget of the Union for the financial year 2015 by EUR 66.1 million in commitment appropriations to finance measures
for managing the refugee and migration crisis. The 2015 ceiling for heading 3 does not allow for an adequate financing of important and urgent
political priorities of the Union.
Therefore, the European Parliament agreed to the proposed allocation of the corresponding payment appropriations of EUR 52.9 million in
2016 and EUR 13.2 million in 2017.
Flexibility Instrument: Parliament reiterated that the mobilisation of this instrument shows, once more, the crucial need for the Union budget to
be more flexible.
It reiterated its long-standing view that, without prejudice to the possibility for payment appropriations to be mobilised for specific budget lines
through the Flexibility Instrument without prior mobilisations in commitments, the payments stemming from commitments previously mobilised
through the Flexibility Instrument can only be counted over and above the ceilings.

2015/2253(BUD) - 28/10/2015 Final act
PURPOSE: to mobilise the Flexibility Instrument for immediate budgetary measures under the European Agenda on Migration.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision (EU) 2015/2248 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the mobilisation of the Flexibility
Instrument for immediate budgetary measures under the European Agenda on Migration.
CONTENT: Council Regulation (EU, EURATOM) No 1311/2013 of 2 December 2013 laying down the multiannual financial framework for the
years 2014-2020 allows for the mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument to allow the financing of clearly identified expenditure which could not
be financed within the limits of the ceilings available for one or more headings of the multiannual financial framework.
Article 11 of Council Regulation 1311/2013 has established a Flexibility Instrument of up to EUR 471 million (2011 prices) per year.
After having examined all possibilities for re-allocating appropriations and exhausted any unallocated margin under the expenditure heading
Security and Citizenship (heading 3), it is necessary to mobilise the Flexibility Instrument. This mobilisation concerns an amount of EUR 66.1
million beyond the ceiling of heading 3 of the multiannual financial framework, and is intended to finance support for measures for managing
the refugee crisis.
The payment appropriations corresponding to the mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument are EUR 52.9 million in 2016 and EUR 13.2 million
in 2017.
