EP

Summary

Parliament called for the immediate and unconditional release of Nadiya Savchenko, military pilot and former officer of the Ukrainian armed
forces, who was illegally kidnapped by Russia and detained in prison for nearly one year. According to Members, Nadiya Savchenkos
detention as a prisoner of war in a prison in Russia is a violation of the Geneva Convention and that those responsible for her illegal detention
in Russia may face international sanctions or legal proceedings for their actions.
Recalling Ms Savchenkos extremely fragile state of health, Members called on the Russian authorities to allow impartial international doctors
access to Ms Savchenko, while ensuring that any medical or psychological examinations are done only with Ms Savchenkos consent and
taking into consideration the consequences of her being on hunger strike for a very long period. Russia should allow international humanitarian
organisations to have permanent access to her.
Parliament also urged:
the President of France and the Chancellor of Germany, as well as the relevant Foreign Ministers, to raise the question of the release
of Nadiya Savchenko at the next meetings of the Contact Group on the implementation of the Minsk Agreements;
the VP/HR, the Commission and the European External Action Service (EEAS) to continue to follow closely the case of Nadiya
Savchenko, and to keep Parliament informed about the outcome of these efforts.
