The European Parliament approved by 381 votes to 144, with 130 abstentions, the appointment of Wilhelm Molterer for the position of
Managing Director of the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI).
To recall, Regulation (EU) 2015/1017 provides that the Managing Director and Deputy Managing Director of the EFSI are to be appointed by

which the European Parliament shall be kept duly informed in a timely manner at all stages.
On 2 October 2015, the Steering Board of the EFSI adopted a proposal for the appointment of the Managing Director and Deputy Managing
Director of the EFSI and transmitted this proposal to the European Parliament.
On 13 October 2015, the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs held a hearing with Wilhelm Molterer,
the proposed candidate for the function of Managing Director of the EFSI.
