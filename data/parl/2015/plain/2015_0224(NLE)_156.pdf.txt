PURPOSE: to conclude a Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and Liberia and the Implementation
Protocol thereto.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: on the basis of the relevant negotiating directives, the Commission conducted negotiations with the Government of Liberia

with a view to concluding a new Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement and an Implementation Protocol thereto between the European
Union and Liberia. Following these negotiations, a new Agreement and Protocol were initialled on 5 June 2015.
It is now appropriate to conclude that Protocol on behalf of the European Union.
CONTENT: the draft decision calls on the Council to approve, on behalf of the European Union, the new Sustainable Fisheries Partnership
Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Liberia and the Implementation Protocol.
Objectives: the new Agreement will provide for a framework taking into account the priorities of the reformed Common Fisheries Policy and its
external dimension, with a view to establishing a strategic partnership between the European Union and Liberia.
The main objective of the new Protocol is to provide fishing opportunities to Union vessels in the Liberian fishing zone, on the basis of the best
available scientific advice and respecting the recommendations of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas
(ICCAT), where applicable within the limits of the available surplus.
The aim is also to enhance cooperation between the European Union and Liberia to promote a sustainable fisheries policy and sound
exploitation of fisheries resources in Liberia?s fishing zone, in the interests of both parties.
Financial contribution: the annual financial contribution has been set at:
EUR 715 000 for the first year,
EUR 650 000 for the second, third and fourth years, and
EUR 585 000 for the fifth year, on the basis of:
(a) a reference tonnage of 6 500 tonnes, for which an amount linked to access has been set at EUR 357 500 for the first year, EUR 325 000
for the second, third and fourth years, and EUR 292 500 for the fifth year; and

000 for the second, third and fourth years, and EUR 292 500 for the fifth year. This support meets the objectives of the national fisheries policy
and in particular the Republic of Liberia?s needs in relation to scientific research, artisanal fisheries as well as fisheries monitoring, control and
surveillance and the fight against illegal fishing.
Fishing opportunities: the Protocol provides for fishing opportunities in the following categories:
28 tuna seiners;
6 surface long-liners.
The allocation of fishing opportunities will be set out between the EU Member States.

2015/0224(NLE) - 10/11/2015 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude the Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement, together with the implementation Protocol, setting out the fishing
opportunities and financial contribution between the Union and Liberia.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: the Union and Liberia negotiated a Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement and an Implementation Protocol thereto,
granting Union vessels fishing opportunities in the waters over which Liberia has sovereignty or jurisdiction in respect of fisheries.
The Agreement and the Protocol were signed in accordance with a Council Decision and apply on a provisional basis.
The Agreement and the Protocol should now be approved.
CONTENT: with this proposal, the Council is called upon to approve the Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European
Union and Liberia and the Implementation Protocol thereto.
Objective: the aim of the Agreement is to strengthen cooperation between the EU and Liberia in promoting the introduction of responsible
fisheries to ensure the sustainable exploitation of marine biological resources in the Liberian fishing zone, in the interests of both parties.
Protocol: a Protocol sets out the fishing opportunities and EU financial contribution, with total amounts varying according to the year of
implementation of the Protocol.
For more information on the fishing opportunities and financial contribution, please see the summary of the initial legislative proposal of
30.9.2015.
NB: the allocation of fishing opportunities between the EU Member States is set out in the Protocol.
Joint Committee: the Agreement establishes a Joint Committee, which is responsible for monitoring the performance, interpretation and
application of the Agreement. Furthermore, the Joint Committee may approve certain modifications to the Protocol.
In order to facilitate the approval of such modifications, the Commission will be empowered, subject to specific conditions, to approve them
under a simplified procedure.
The Commission will be authorised to negotiate with Liberia modifications to the Protocol in respect of the following issues:
review of fishing opportunities, and, consequently, of the relevant financial contribution;
the modalities of the sectoral support regarding fisheries;
measures to ensure sustainable management of the fisheries resources;

technical provisions of the Protocol.
In the Joint Committee the Union shall act in accordance with the objectives it pursued within the framework of the Common Fisheries Policy,
and promote positions that are consistent with the relevant rules adopted by Regional Fisheries Management Organisations. The Joint
Committee shall ensure that the position to be expressed on behalf of the Union takes account of the latest statistical, biological and other
relevant information transmitted to the Commission.
Technical provisions set out the framework and practical modalities for approving modifications to the Protocol.
To this effect and based on that information, a document setting out the particulars of the proposed Union position shall be transmitted by the
Commission services, in sufficient time before the relevant Joint Committee Meeting, to the Council or to its preparatory bodies for
consideration and approval.
Duration of the Agreement: the Protocol and Agreement cover a period of five years from the date of their provisional application, i.e. from the
date of their signature.

2015/0224(NLE) - 21/04/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Fisheries adopted the report by Jaros?aw WA??SA (EPP, PL) on the draft Council decision on the conclusion on behalf of
the European Union of the Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Liberia and the
Implementation Protocol thereto.
The committee called on the European Parliament to give its consent to the conclusion of the Agreement and the Protocol thereto.
In a short justification accompanying the report, Members considered that the SPFA with Liberia and its implementation Protocol is coherent
with the aims of the Common Fisheries Policy, of a sustainable management of Fisheries and aquaculture activities and that it is of great
mutual benefit to both parties.
The agreement seeks to strengthen the cooperation between the Union and Liberia, and more generally with West Africa where important tuna
fishing zones are located. It promotes a partnership framework in which to develop a sustainable fisheries policy and responsible exploitation
of fishery resources in the Liberian fishing zone. It helps the European Union in its global fight against IUU fishing by supporting the
improvement of monitoring, control and surveillance (MCS) of the Liberian fisheries sector and Economic Exclusive Zone.
This is in the interest of both Parties, in line with relevant conservation and management measures and within the limits of the available
surplus.
Lastly, in general the report regretted that the European Parliament has a limited role in the adoption of the Sustainable Fisheries Partnership
agreements through only a consent procedure. It considered that the European Parliament should be awarded a more active role and be
immediately and fully informed at all stages of the procedures concerning the FPAs or its renewals in order to increase transparency and
democratic accountability of the protocols.

2015/0224(NLE) - 10/05/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 584 votes to 35, with 43 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the draft Council decision on the

In line with the recommendation made by the Committee on Fisheries, Parliament gave its consent to the conclusion of the Agreement and its
Protocol.
The aim of the Agreement is to strengthen cooperation between the EU and Liberia in promoting the introduction of responsible fisheries to
ensure the sustainable exploitation of marine biological resources in the Liberian fishing zone, in the interests of both parties.
