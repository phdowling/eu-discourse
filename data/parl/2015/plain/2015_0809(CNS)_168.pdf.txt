Summary

2015/0809(CNS) - 24/08/2015 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to approve the conclusion by the European Police Office (Europol) of the Agreement on Strategic Cooperation in the fight against
serious crime and terrorism between the United Arab Emirates and Europol.
PROPOSED ACT: Council implementing decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to
follow its opinion.
BACKGROUND: pursuant to Decision 2009/371/JHA establishing the European Police Office (Europol) and Decision 2009/934/JHA adopting
the implementing rules governing Europol's relations with partners, including the exchange of personal data and classified information, Europol
is to conclude agreements with the third States which have been put on the list determined by Decision 2009/935/JHA.
Such agreements have the objective of supporting and strengthening action by the competent authorities of the Member States and their
mutual cooperation in preventing and combating organised crime, terrorism and other forms of serious crime affecting two or more Member
States, and may concern the exchange of operational, strategic or technical information, including personal data and classified information.
The United Arab Emirates is included in the list determined by Decision 2009/935/JHA.
In order to increase effectiveness in preventing and combating serious forms of crime, Europol has initiated, in accordance with Decision
2009/934/JHA, the procedure for the conclusion of an Agreement on Strategic Cooperation in the fight against serious crime and terrorism
between the United Arab Emirates and Europol (Strategic Agreement).
Strategic agreements may be concluded by Europol only after approval by the Council, the latter having previously consulted the Management
Board of Europol. The Management Board approved the Operational and Strategic Agreement on 13 May 2015.
The conditions for triggering the exercise of the implementing powers by the Council pursuant to Decisions 2009/371/JHA, 2009/934/JHA and
2009/935/JHA have been met.
CONTENT: in accordance with the draft implementing decision, Europol shall be authorised to conclude the Agreement on Strategic
Cooperation between the United Arab Emirates and Europol.
The terms of the cooperation governed by the Strategic Agreement provide for the exchange of information, which may include specialist
knowledge, general situation reports, results of strategic analysis, information on criminal investigation procedures and information on
crime-prevention methods; participation in training activities; and the provision of advice and support in individual criminal investigations.
In addition, the Agreement contains no provisions relating to the exchange of personal data.
Denmark, the United Kingdom and Ireland shall all take part in the adoption and application of this Decision.

2015/0809(CNS) - 03/12/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs adopted, in the framework of a special legislative procedure (Parliaments
consultation), the report by Alessandra MUSSOLINI (EPP, IT) on the draft Council implementing decision approving the conclusion by the

European Police Office (Europol) of the Agreement on Strategic Cooperation in the fight against serious crime and terrorism between the
United Arab Emirates and Europol.
The committee recommended the European Parliament to approve the Council draft.
The Commission is called upon to:
assess, after the entry into force of the new Europol Regulation, the provisions contained in the cooperation agreement, in particular
on data protection;
inform the Parliament and the Council of the outcome of this assessment and, if appropriate, to submit a recommendation for an
authorisation to open international renegotiation of the agreement.
To recall, according to the current Europol Council Decision (Decision 2009/371/JHA), it is for the Council to approve the conclusion of
international cooperation agreements with thirds states or international organisations, after having consulted the European Parliament. Such
agreements may concern the exchange of operational, strategic, technical or classified information. The operational cooperation agreement
also includes the exchange of personal data.
This proposal concerns the proposed approval of a strategic cooperation agreement between Europol and the United Arab Emirates. Such
strategic agreement excludes the exchange of personal data, so the issue of data protection is not relevant in this case. The information
exchanged could include specialist knowledge, general situation reports, results of strategic analysis, information on criminal investigation
procedures, information on crime-prevention methods, training activities, and the provision of advice and support in individual criminal
investigations.
The explanatory statement accompanying the report stated that according to Europol, the United Arab Emirates are increasingly relevant in the
fight against organized crime as that country is becoming a growing hub for economic and financial crime. Proceeds from criminal activities
such as Value Added Tax (VAT) fraud, Missing Trader Intra Community (MTIC) fraud and Money Laundering have been reinvested in the
United Arab Emirates and key criminals involved in these frauds have sought refuge there.
The conclusion of this strategic cooperation agreement with the United Arab Emirates would aid and reinforce the fight against financial fraud
and would contribute to enhancing international cooperation in the field of financial investigation and other relevant criminal matters.

2015/0809(CNS) - 15/12/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 490 votes to 159, with 44 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the draft Council implementing decision
approving the conclusion by the European Police Office (Europol) of the Agreement on Strategic Cooperation in the fight against serious crime
and terrorism between the United Arab Emirates and Europol.
Parliament approved the Council draft under the Parliaments consultation procedure. It called on the Commission to:
assess, after the entry into force of the new Europol Regulation, the provisions contained in the cooperation agreement, in particular
on data protection;
inform the Parliament and the Council of the outcome of this assessment and, if appropriate, to submit a recommendation for an
authorisation to open international renegotiation of the agreement.
