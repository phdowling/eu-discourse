2015/2200(DEC) - 23/07/2015 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: presentation by the Commission of the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2014, as part of
the 2014 discharge procedure.
Analysis of the accounts of the Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking (IMI 2).
CONTENT: this Commission document sets out the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2014 as
prepared on the basis of the information presented by the institutions, organisations and bodies of the EU, in accordance with Article 148 (2) of
the Financial Regulation applicable to the EU's General Budget, including the IMI 2 Joint Undertaking.
The document contains the figures on which the discharge procedure is based.
On this basis, the Financial Controller of the European Commission ensures the certification of the consolidated accounts as declared by the
institutions, agencies and bodies of the European Union.
Discharge procedure of the EU Joint Undertakings: the EU Budget finances a wide range of policies and programmes throughout the EU. In
accordance with the priorities set by the European Parliament and the Council in the multi-annual financial framework (MFF), the European
Commission carries out specific programmes, activities and projects in the field with the technical support of some specialised agencies.
The consolidated annual accounts of the EU provide information on the activities of the institutions, agencies and other bodies of the EU from
a budgetary and accrual accounting perspective.
The consolidated reports on the implementation of the general budget of the EU include the budget implementation of all Institutions. Agencies
and Joint Undertakings (JUs) do not have a separate budget inside the EU budget ; and they are partially financed by a Commission budget

subsidy.
This document sets out how the JUs spent and implemented their budget in 2014. Each agency is subject to its own discharge procedure.
IMI 2: in 2014, the tasks and budget of the Joint Undertaking were as follows:
description of the tasks of the Joint Undertaking: the IMI 2 Joint undertaking, which is located in Brussels, was set up by Council
Regulation (EU) No 557/2014, for a period up to 31 December 2024. The IMI Joint Undertaking 2 aims to increase clinical trial
success rates of priority medicines identified by the World health Organization and where possible, reduce the time to reach clinical
proof of concept in medicine development for certain diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's disease;
accounts of the JU: the IMI JU 2 officially began operations on 7.9.2014, following those of the IMI JU and launched its first calls for
tender in the framework of the Ebola crisis. The ownership participation at year-end is as follows 80.47% in IMI 2.
Please also consult the final accounts of IMI 2 Joint Undertaking.

2015/2200(DEC) - 06/10/2015 Court of Auditors: opinion, report
PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) 2 Joint
Undertaking for the financial year 2014, together with the Joint Undertakings reply.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit concerned, amongst others, the annual accounts of the IMI 2 Joint Undertaking (initiative on innovative medicine).
Statement of assurance: pursuant to the provisions of Article 287 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the Court
has audited:
the annual accounts of the IMI 2 Joint Undertaking, which comprise the financial statements and the reports on the implementation of
the budget for the financial year ended 31 December 2014;
the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying those accounts.
Opinion on the reliability of the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the Joint Undertakings annual accounts present fairly, in all material respects,
its financial position as at 31 December 2014, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with
the provisions of its financial rules and the rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
Opinion on the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the transactions underlying the annual
accounts for the year ended 31 December 2014 are, in all material respects, legal and regular.
The audit also revealed the following points:
budgetary and financial management: the budgetary implementation rate for commitment appropriations ranged between 90 % and
100 % for most Joint Undertakings including IMI 2 and the rate for payment appropriations was 74 %;
procurement: the Court notes that with regard to calls for proposals, the final rate of appropriations committed achieved a figure
between 90 % and 100 %, including IMI 2.
Cross-cutting remarks for all the Joint undertakings: the monitoring and reporting of research results is laid down in the Seventh Framework
Programme (FP7). In the grant agreements signed with members and other beneficiaries, the Joint Undertakings have included specific
provisions governing intellectual property rights and the dissemination of research activities and results. The implementation of these
provisions is monitored by the Joint Undertakings at different stages of the funded projects and significant progress has been achieved in
2014. However, in order to meet the requirements of Horizon 2020 and to better contribute to the dissemination of FP7 research results, the
Court considers that cooperation between the Joint Undertakings and the Commission must be developed as much as possible with special
regard to the further integration of some of the Joint Undertakings data into the Commissions systems.
The Court also indicates that there is room to improve procedures, in particular in the implementation of the ex-post audit strategy, and
cooperation with the Commission as regards the integration of the research results.
Replies of the Joint Undertaking: the Joint Undertaking states that it remains committed to managing its funding under the principle of sound
financial management and through a trust-based approach with the participants in the projects whilst ensuring sufficient control and
accountability. This approach will also contribute towards ensuring a successful outcome of the IMI projects as many of them are already
starting to generate promising results, in the interest of patients and society at large.
With regard to the activities of the Joint Undertaking in 2014, the report refers to the Joint Undertakings latest available annual activity report
for 2014 available at the following address: www.imi.europa.eu
It should be noted that the budget for IMI 2 for 2014 was EUR 223 294 603 in commitment appropriations and EUR 170 801 250 EUR in
payment appropriations.

2015/2200(DEC) - 27/01/2016 Supplementary non-legislative basic document
Having examined the revenue and expenditure accounts for the financial year 2014 and the balance sheet as at 31 December 2014 of the
Innovative Medicines Initiative Joint Undertaking and the Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking, as well as the Court of Auditors'

report on the annual accounts of the Joint Undertaking for the financial year 2014, accompanied by the Joint Undertaking's replies to the
Court's observations, the Council recommended the European Parliament to give a discharge to the Executive Director of the successor Joint
Undertaking in respect of the implementation of the budget of the Joint Undertaking for the financial year 2014.
The Council recalled that the Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking (IMI2) has replaced and succeeded the Innovative Medicines
Initiative Joint Undertaking and that discharge should therefore be given to the Executive Director of the successor Joint Undertaking.
The Council welcomed the Court's opinion that, in all material respects, the Joint Undertaking's annual accounts present fairly its financial
position as at 31 December 2014 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions
of the Joint Undertaking's Financial Rules, and that the underlying transactions for 2014 are legal and regular in all material respects.
Nevertheless, the Council made the following observations:
financial programming: the Council called on the successor Joint Undertaking to pay due attention to proper financial programming
and budget implementation in order to reduce the level of commitment appropriations carried over to the following financial year to the
strict minimum, in line with the budgetary principle of annuality;
controls: the Council deplored that the Council regretted that weaknesses were identified by the Court. It called on the successor Joint
Undertaking to reinforce ex-ante controls on the payment of project costs;
research results: the Council also invited the successor Joint Undertaking to improve the monitoring and reporting of research results
by implementing the recommendations made by the Commission's Internal Audit Service.

2015/2200(DEC) - 07/04/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Marian-Jean MARINESCU (EPP, RO) on discharge in respect of the
implementation of the budget of the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI2) Joint Undertaking for the financial year 2014.
The parliamentary committee calls on the European Parliament to grant the joint undertakings Executive Director discharge in respect of the
implementation of the joint undertakings budget for the financial year 2014.
Noting that the Court of Auditors issued a statement of assurance as to the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the
underlying transactions for the financial year 2014, Members call on Parliament to approve the closure of the joint undertakings accounts.
They made, however, a number of recommendations that need to be taken into account when the discharge is granted. They may be
summarised as follows:
General remark: Members note that the Court of Auditors' report is based on too many general remarks to the detriment of viable,
specific ones. They therefore call for an audit with a sharper focus on the annual financial performance, on the implementation status
of multiannual projects (including a clear presentation of the implementation of the budget for the respective year and for previous
years) and on the results and their implementation. They note that the Institutions and Bodies are required to produce each year a
Report on Budgetary and Financial Management and that the information provided by the Joint Undertaking in this report lacked
harmonisation and was often incomplete. They call on the Commission to provide guidance as to the nature and content of the report.
Budget and financial management: Members note that the joint undertaking's annual budget included commitment appropriations
amounting to EUR 223 million and payment appropriations amounting to EUR 171 million. They note the overall implementation rate
was 92.4 % (99.5 % for 2013) for commitment appropriations and 73.9 % (97.5 % for 2013) for payment appropriations. Members note
the lack of information on the ex post audits carried out by the IMI and IMI2 joint undertakings. They invite the Court to include in
future reports information regarding the number of ex-post audits, the total amounts covered and the findings. They call on the Court
to include more information on budget execution (commitment and payments, including in-kind and cash contributions) for FP 7 and
Horizon 2020 programmes in the upcoming annual reports.
Lastly, Members issue a series of observations regarding conflicts of interest in the joint undertaking, the undertaking's legal framework, and
procurement and internal control procedures.

2015/2200(DEC) - 28/04/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament decided to grant the Executive Director of the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI2) Joint Undertaking (formerly the
Joint Undertaking for the implementation of the Joint Technology Initiative on Innovative Medicines) discharge in respect of the implementation
of the Joint Undertakings budget for the financial year 2014. The vote on the decision on discharge covers the closure of the accounts (in
accordance with Annex V, Article 5 (1)(a) to Parliaments Rules of Procedure.
Noting that the Court of Auditors has stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the Joint Undertakings annual accounts for the
financial year 2014 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Parliament adopted by 512 votes to 113 with 7
abstentions, a resolution containing a series of recommendations, which form an integral part of the decision on discharge and which add to
the general recommendations set out in the resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies:
General remark: Parliament noted that the Court of Auditors' report is based on too many general remarks to the detriment of viable,
specific ones. It therefore called for an audit with a sharper focus on the annual financial performance, on the implementation status of
multiannual projects (including a clear presentation of the implementation of the budget for the respective year and for previous years)
and on the results and their implementation. It noted that the Institutions and Bodies are required to produce each year a Report on
Budgetary and Financial Management and that the information provided by the Joint Undertaking in this report lacked harmonisation
and was often incomplete. It called on the Commission to provide guidance as to the nature and content of the report.
Budget and financial management: Parliament noted that the joint undertaking's annual budget included commitment appropriations
amounting to EUR 223 million and payment appropriations amounting to EUR 171 million. It noted the overall implementation rate was
92.4 % (99.5 % for 2013) for commitment appropriations and 73.9 % (97.5 % for 2013) for payment appropriations. Parliament noted
the lack of information on the ex post audits carried out by the IMI and IMI2 joint undertakings. It invited the Court to include in future
reports information regarding the number of ex-post audits, the total amounts covered and the findings. It called on the Court to

include more information on budget execution (commitment and payments, including in-kind and cash contributions) for FP 7 and
Horizon 2020 programmes in the upcoming annual reports.
Lastly, Parliament issued a series of observations regarding conflicts of interest in the joint undertaking, the undertaking's legal framework, and
procurement and internal control procedures.

2015/2200(DEC) - 28/04/2016 Final act
PURPOSE: to grant discharge to the IMI Joint Undertaking for the financial year 2014.
NON LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision (EU) 2016/1591 of the European Parliament on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of
the Joint Technology Initiative on Innovative Medicines for the financial year 2014.
CONTENT: with the present decision, the European Parliament grants discharge to the Executive Director of the Innovative Medicines
Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking (formerly the Joint Undertaking for the implementation of the Joint Technology Initiative on Innovative Medicines)
for the financial year 2014.
This decision is in line with the European Parliament's resolution adopted on 28 April 2016 and comprises a series of observations that form
an integral part of the discharge decision (please refer to the summary of the opinion of 28 April 2016).
Amongst Parliaments main observations in the resolution accompanying the discharge decision, the latter considered that, in the absence of a
clear separation between FP 7 and Horizon 2020 implementation-related information, the indicators used do not ensure a real evaluation of
performance. It called on the Court to set out in its future reports information regarding the execution of the budget under FP 7 and that of
Horizon 2020 separately.
