Summary

PURPOSE: to amend the EU rules transposing the Scheme of control and enforcement adopted by the North East Atlantic Fisheries
Commission (NEAFC).
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: the Convention on Future Multilateral Cooperation in North East Atlantic Fisheries to which the European Union is a
Contracting Party aims to ensure the long term conservation and optimum utilisation of the fishery resources of the North East Atlantic area,
providing sustainable, environmental and social benefits.
For the purpose of ensuring the application of this Convention and recommendations adopted by the North East Atlantic Commission
(NEAFC), measures concerning control and enforcement relating to fisheries concerned may be adopted.
Regulation (EU) No 1236/2010 transposes into Union law the Scheme of control and enforcement adopted by the NEAFC.
At its Annual Meetings in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015, NEAFC adopted:
·

Recommendation 15:2013 amending the Scheme, concerning the communication of transhipments and of port of landing;

·

Recommendation 9:2014 amending the Scheme, concerning, respectively, the definitions, a number of provisions applying to Port
State Control of foreign fishing vessels and the infringement procedures;

·

Recommendation 12:2015 amending Recommendation 9:2014 with respect to Articles 22 and 23 of the Scheme on Port State
Control of foreign fishing vessels.

These Recommendations were adopted with the full support of the EU in NEAFC. It is in the EU's interest therefore that they be introduced in
Union law by means of the proposed regulation.
CONTENT: the proposal seeks to amend Regulation (EU) No 1236/2010 in order to incorporate it into Union law amendments to the Scheme
as adopted in NEAFC Recommendations 15/2013 and 9/2014 as amended by Recommendation 12/2015 which have become binding for the
Contracting Parties to NEAFC and consequently for the EU.
·

The main change, operated by Recommendation 9/2014, is the alignment of the Scheme with the FAO Agreement on Port State
Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate IUU, approved by the EU in 2011. Contracting Parties have agreed that this
recommendation will enter into force on 1 July 2015.

·

The other change, made through Recommendation 15/2013, clarifies that vessels involved in a transhipment operation in the
Regulatory Area as receiving vessel shall communicate the port of landing regardless of whether the landing is to take place in a port
inside or outside the Convention Area.

Recommendation 12/2015 amended Recommendation 9/2014 with respect to notification procedures on Port State Control of foreign fishing
vessels with the aim to adapt them for the switch-over from a paper based system to a modern web-based ICT application, operated by the
NEAFC Secretary.

2015/0063(COD) - 14/10/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Fisheries adopted the report by Ole CHRISTENSEN (S&D, DK) on the proposal for a regulation of the European
Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) No 1236/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down a scheme
of control and enforcement applicable in the area covered by the Convention on future multilateral cooperation in the Northeast Atlantic
fisheries.
The committee recommended the European Parliament to adopt its position at first reading, taking over the Commission proposal.
In this explanatory statement accompanying the draft resolution, it is recalled that the main amendment to Regulation 1236/2010 concerns the
alignment of the FAO Agreement control system on measures pertaining to port State competencies in order to prevent, deter and eliminate
IUU fishing.
The measures provided by this amendment will ensure a better long-term conservation and optimum utilization of fishery resources in the area
of the Northeast Atlantic, bringing lasting results under the environmental and social aspects.
Considering that the entry into force of the amended version of the recommendation should have taken place by 1 July 2015, it has been
decided not to propose amendments in order to speed up the process of adoption as much as possible.
