Summary

2015/2580(DEA) - 20/05/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 486 votes to 164 with 26 abstentions, a resolution on the Commission delegated regulation of 20
February 2015 amending Regulation (EC) No 376/2008 as regards the obligation to present a licence for imports of ethyl alcohol of agricultural
origin and repealing Regulation (EC) No 2336/2003 introducing certain detailed rules for applying Council Regulation (EC) No 670/2003 laying
down specific measures concerning the market in ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin.
Parliament objected to the delegated regulation.
The aim of delegated regulation was to:
remove the obligation for the EU to establish and publish an EU balance sheet for ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin and the quarterly
obligation for Member States to provide information on production, disposal and stocks ;
remove the obligation to present an import licence for the import of ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin into the EU, including the lodging
of a security.
In its resolution, Parliament recalled that the following-up of data relating to ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin ensured both transparency and
knowledge as regards the evolution of the market, which was still unstable and which faced strong competition, in particular on account of
importation from third countries.
Such information was also extremely useful when it came to international agreement negotiations and anti-dumping investigations.
Furthermore, Eurostat did not provide such precise information, meaning that there was no alternative way for operators, Member States and
EU institutions to be fully aware of the situation of the market.
