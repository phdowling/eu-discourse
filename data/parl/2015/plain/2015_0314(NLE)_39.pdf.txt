2015/0314(NLE) - 15/12/2015 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to suspend the obligations of Sweden as a Member State of relocation for the period of one year.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to
follow its opinion.
BACKGROUND: the considerable increase of irregular border crossing into the EU and of secondary movements across Europe has led to a
sharp increase in Sweden of the number of applicants for international protection, who mainly entered the EU via Italy and Greece. Sweden
has in 2015 by far the highest number of applicants for international protection per capita in the EU (11 503 applicants per million inhabitants).
The above situation has put a very significant strain on the Swedish asylum system, with serious practical consequences on the ground as
regards the reception conditions and ability of the asylum system to deal with these applications.
As part of the common policy on asylum, Article 78(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) provides a specific legal basis to deal
with emergency situations. Based on a proposal by the European Commission, it enables the Council, after consulting the European
Parliament, to adopt provisional measures for the benefit of Member State(s) confronted with an emergency situation characterised by a
sudden inflow of nationals of third countries into one or more Member State(s).
The provisional measures envisaged by Article 78(3) TFEU are exceptional in nature. They can only be triggered when a certain threshold of
urgency and severity of the problems created in the Member State(s)' asylum system(s) by a sudden inflow of third country nationals is met.

On the basis of Article 78(3) TFEU, the Council adopted two Decisions establishing provisional measures in the area of international protection
for the benefit of Italy and Greece. Under the Council Decision (EU) 2015/1523, 1 369 persons and under the Council Decision (EU)
2015/1601, 4 358 persons are allocated to Sweden for relocation from Italy and Greece.
A Member State may, according to Decision 2015/1601, notify the Commission and the Council that it is confronted with an emergency
situation characterised by a sudden inflow of nationals of third countries due to a sharp shift of migration flows, giving duly justified reasons.
On 8 December 2015, Sweden formally requested the suspension of its obligations under Council Decisions (EU) 2015/1523 and (EU)
2015/1601.
CONTENT: in view of assisting Sweden in better coping with this emergency situation, the proposed Decision suspends the obligations of
Sweden as a Member State of relocation under Council Decisions (EU) 2015/1523 and Council Decision (EU) 2015/1601 for the period of one
year.
The suspension should be complemented, as appropriate, by additional support measures coordinated by European Asylum Support Office
(EASO) and, where needed, other relevant Agencies.
Sweden is still bound to relocate to its territory 1 369 persons under the Council Decision (EU) 2015/1523 and 4 358 persons under the
Council Decision (EU) 2015/1601 from Italy and Greece once the present Decision has expired. It should submit to the Council and the
Commission a roadmap setting out the measures that it will take in order to ensure the effectiveness of its asylum and migration system and to
resume its obligations under Decisions (EU) 2015/1523 and (EU) 2015/1601.

2015/0314(NLE) - 03/05/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs adopted the report by Ska KELLER (Greens/EFA) on the proposal for a Council
decision establishing provisional measures in the area of international protection for the benefit of Sweden in accordance with Article 9 of
Council Decision (EU) 2015/1523 and Article 9 of Council Decision (EU) 2015/1601 establishing provisional measures in the area of
international protection for the benefit of Italy and Greece.
The committee approved the Commission proposal subject to amendments.
Members stipulated in the recitals:
that Sweden formally requested the suspension of its obligations under Council Decisions (EU) 2015/1523 and (EU) 2015/1601,
having to face both challenges of being a country of first arrival and final destination;
that in March 2016, Sweden had received a total of 170 104 applicants, of which 73 331 were children, including 36 181
unaccompanied minors who have special needs and require additional resources in order to provide access to health care, dignified
accommodation and education according to Union asylum rules.

2015/0314(NLE) - 26/05/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 396 votes to 190, with 50 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a Council decision
establishing provisional measures in the area of international protection for the benefit of Sweden in accordance with Article 9 of Council
Decision (EU) 2015/1523 and Article 9 of Council Decision (EU) 2015/1601 establishing provisional measures in the area of international
protection for the benefit of Italy and Greece.
Parliament stipulated in the recitals that:
Sweden formally requested the suspension of its obligations under Council Decisions (EU) 2015/1523 and (EU) 2015/1601, having to
face both challenges of being a country of first arrival and final destination;
Sweden had in 2015 by far the highest number of applicants for international protection per capita in the EU (11 503 applicants per
million inhabitants) and in March 2016, Sweden had received a total of 170 104 applicants, of which 73 331 were children, including
36 181 unaccompanied minors who have special needs and require additional resources in order to provide access to health care,
dignified accommodation and education according to Union asylum rules.

2015/0314(NLE) - 09/06/2016 Final act
PURPOSE: to establish provisional measures in the area of international protection for the benefit of Sweden, by suspending for one year
Sweden's obligations as a Member State of relocation.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Council Decision (EU) 2016/946 establishing provisional measures in the area of international protection for the
benefit of Sweden in accordance with Article 9 of Decision (EU) 2015/1523 and Article 9 of Decision (EU) 2015/1601 establishing provisional
measures in the area of international protection for the benefit of Italy and Greece.
CONTENT: this Decision establishes provisional measures in the area of international protection for the benefit of Sweden , in order to support
it in better coping with an emergency situation characterised by a sudden inflow of nationals of third countries.
In Sweden, the number of applicants for international protection increased by more than 60 % from 68 245 applicants for the period from 1
January to 31 October 2014 to 112 040 applicants for the period from 1 January to 31 October 2015. In 2015, it had by far the highest number
of applicants for international protection per capita in the Union in 2015, with 11 503 applicants per million inhabitants, with one out of four
applicants claiming to be an unaccompanied minor.
Taking account of this situation, the Decision stipulates that the obligations of Sweden as a Member State of relocation under Decisions (EU)
2015/1523 and (EU) 2015/1601 shall be suspended until 16 June 2017.

The suspension of Sweden's obligations should be complemented, where appropriate, by operational support measures coordinated by the
European Asylum Support Office (EASO) and by other relevant Agencies.
Sweden should present to the Council and to the Commission a roadmap setting out the measures that it will take in order to ensure the
effectiveness of its asylum and migration system and to resume its obligations under Decisions (EU) 2015/1523 and (EU) 2015/1601 once the
suspension of its obligations ceases to have effect.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 16.6.2016.
