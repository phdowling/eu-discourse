2015/2053(INI) - 15/07/2014 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: to launch a debate on the possible extension of geographical indication protection of the European Union to non-agricultural
products (Commission Green Paper).
BACKGROUND: geographical indications (GIs) are indications that identify goods as originating in a country, region or locality where a
particular quality, reputation or other characteristic of the product is essentially attributable to its geographical origin, for example Bordeaux
(wine), Vetro di Murano (glass) or Prosciutto di Parma.
GIs are self-evidently relevant to agricultural products, foodstuff, wines and other alcoholic beverages. However, the use of GIs is not limited to
agricultural products. A GI may also highlight specific qualities of a product that are due to human factors found in the products place of origin,
such as specific manufacturing skills and traditions. This is the case, for instance, for handicrafts, which are generally handmade using local
natural resources and usually embedded in the traditions of local communities, e.g. Bohemian crystal, Scottish tartans, Carrara marble or
Meissner porcelain.
The EU is bound by rules on protecting GIs under the agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property rights ( TRIPS), which applies

to all 159 members of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), and covers both agricultural and non-agricultural products.
At EU level, unitary GI protection is currently provided for wines, spirit drinks, aromatised wines and for agricultural products and foodstuffs.
There is currently no harmonisation or unitary GI protection in place for non-agricultural products at EU level .
According to a study published by the Commission in 2013, existing legal instruments available for producers at national and at European level
are insufficient.
CONTENT: this Green Paper aims to consult with all stakeholders in the broadest possible manner on whether there is a need, in the EU, to
increase GI protection for non-agricultural products, and if so what approach should be taken.
The document consists of two parts:
The first part concerns the current means of protection provided at national and EU level and the potential economic, social and cultural
benefits that could be achieved by improved GI protection in the EU. The Commission considers that there seems to be potential benefits of a
harmonised EU GI system for producers of non-agricultural products:
·

increasing the distinctiveness and attractiveness of their products thanks to guaranteeing quality and origin throughout the EU could
boost sales and there would be more effective and uniform EU-wide protection against losses caused by, counterfeiting and
imitation;

·

provide consumers with certainty that a product has a particular quality, characteristics, and/or reputation due to its particular place
of origin, if this is something they value;

·

create a positive impact on negotiating trade agreements with third countries interested in securing better protection for their
non-agricultural GIs in the EU;

·

preserve and value European traditions, know-how, the diversity of cultural expression and cultural heritage and help build social
capital in a region.

The second part includes more technical questions to seek the views of interested parties on possible options for EU-level GI protection for
non-agricultural products. These issues concern:
·

the label (names and symbols) to be used to refer to a product eligible for a GI protection;

·

the need to add any further exceptions to GI protection other than those already provided in TRIPS;

·

the possibility to differentiate between various protection schemes depending on the categories of non-agricultural products involved
(a sectoral approach would establish specific rules for different categories of products, or a cross-cutting approach would set out the
core elements of the system generally, to apply to any category of product;

·

the link be between non-agricultural products and their place of origin, in order to qualify for GI protection in any new system;

·

the introduction of a quality benchmark for non-agricultural products and how the specific characteristics of the product should be
defined to ensure quality and geographic origin meets the required standards;

·

the need for reputation to be required in order to obtain GI protection for non-agricultural products.

The Green Paper also questions whether harmonising national legislation on GIs would be sufficient to effectively protect GIs for
non-agricultural products across the internal market, or would a single EU-level protection system be more appropriate.
All interested parties are requested to send their responses to the Commission by 28 October 2014.

2015/2053(INI) - 22/09/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Legal Affairs adopted the own-initiative report by Virginie ROZIÈRE (S&D, FR) on the possible extension of geographical
indication (GI) protection of the European Union to non-agricultural products.
The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, exercising its prerogatives as an associated committee in accordance with
Rule 54 of the Parliaments Rules of Procedure, also gave an opinion on the report.
Legislative proposal: Members asked the Commission to propose a legislative proposal with the aim of establishing a single European system
of protection of geographical indications for non-agricultural products, and of ensuring that the effects of the new system on producers, their
competitors, consumers and Member States were fully considered. They stressed that such an instrument would need to be accompanied by
information and communication campaigns.
Benefits of a uniform protection at EU level: the report stressed that it would be highly recommended for the EU to adopt legislation on
non-agricultural GIs, in order to: (i) fully exploit the positive economic effects of protecting the distinctiveness and quality of such products, (ii)
provide consumers with reliable information on their place and method of production, and (iii) preserve the know-how and jobs relating to them.
Members emphasised that the recognition of protection of non-agricultural GIs and traditional, high-quality know-how:
was both a defensive and offensive interest in the framework of the common commercial policy;
fostered innovation and the creation of new start-ups, in particular for small enterprises and micro-enterprises, which were the source
of 80 % of typical locally-made products that could be protected under the geographical indications system;
combatted counterfeit or imitation products;
ensured a more socially, economically and environmentally sustainable approach to economic development inside and outside the
EU;
contributed to fair competition and consumer protection.
Members stressed that preserving traditional know-how and production could help stop the depopulation and destruction of rural areas and the
flow of young people leaving these areas. They called on the Commission and Member States to promote trans regional and transnational

cooperation and the pooling of best practices among non-agricultural product clusters and related sectors.
Relations with third countries: the committee considered that open-ended lists of all products, both agricultural and non-agricultural, that were
protected by geographical indications should be incorporated into future EU trade agreements with non-member countries. Extending the
scope of the GI protection system to cover non-agricultural products could: (i) help make the EUs position on GIs even stronger and more
cogent, in multilateral forums; (ii) stimulate European exports and gain market share while achieving international recognition of the products in
question; (iii) strengthen the Unions hand in the WTO; (iv) be an advantage in negotiating trade agreements with third countries.
The Commission was called upon to include in its upcoming communication on the EUs trade and investment strategy a coherent and
well-prepared strategy for all GIs, which ensures that they are observed and recognised.
Principles and scope of geographical indication protection at EU level: the report asked the Commission to create a system based on best
practices and transparent and non-discriminatory principles, which was effective, responsive and free of unnecessary administrative burdens
and deterrent costs for producers who voluntarily decide to register a product under a geographical indication scheme.
Such a system should ensure strict controls and should include appropriate means of dealing with fraud. Furthermore, the system should:
represent a guarantee which is intuitively perceptible to consumers who sought high-quality products in terms of authenticity and origin
which have a strong link to the geographical area concerned and are supported by reliable and clear information;
have a broad definition that would make it possible to recognise the link between a product and the area covered enabling the
inclusion of names which, though not geographical, were unambiguously associated with a given place; Members recommend that the
protection scheme should include non-verbal signs and symbols that were unmistakably associated with a particular region.
The label/distinguishing sign/mark/logo for non-agricultural GIs should be simple and easily recognisable, should reflect the regional/local
identity of the goods, and should be expressed in at least the language of the products place of origin and that of the country into which it is
imported.
Registration process: the report recommended a compulsory registration procedure, as this would provide greater security, especially as
regards the enforcement of rights in the event of a dispute. Registration should take place in two stages: firstly, on-the-spot checks should be
made by national or regional authorities to ascertain that specific characteristics are not being interfered with; and secondly, there should be a
single European registration system to ensure compliance with common criteria in all parts of the EU.
Members believed that specifications should include at least the following criteria: raw materials used, description of the production process,
proof of the link with the territory, and elements of corporate social responsibility.
The system must be accompanied by the creation of a single standardised and public European register for non-agricultural products
benefiting from geographical indication protection. The report stressed the relevance of quality checks, and advocated, in addition, that an
inspection, infringement and penalty scheme be set up to monitor geographical indications on products marketed in Europe.

2015/2053(INI) - 06/10/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 608 votes to 43, with 43 abstentions, a resolution on the possible extension of geographical indication
(GI) protection of the European Union to non-agricultural products, in response to the Commission Green Paper on the same issue.
European legislative proposal: whilst welcoming the Commissions initiative of consulting stakeholders in order to determine whether EU
geographical indication (GI) protection could be extended to cover non-agricultural products, as well as the outcome of the consultation which
was concluded in October 2014, Parliament clearly favoured an EU system of protection based on geographical indications for non-agricultural
products, as part of a broader strategy for promoting high-quality EU products. It asked the Commission to propose a legislative proposal with
the aim of establishing a single European system of protection of geographical indications for non-agricultural products, and of ensuring that
the effects of the new system on producers, their competitors, consumers and Member States were fully considered.
Members stressed that such an instrument would need to be accompanied by information and communication campaigns.
Benefits of a uniform protection at EU level: Parliament stressed that it would be highly recommended for the EU to adopt legislation on
non-agricultural GIs, in order to: (i) fully exploit the positive economic effects of protecting the distinctiveness and quality of such products, (ii)
provide consumers with reliable information on their place and method of production, and (iii) preserve the know-how and jobs relating to them.
The resolution emphasised that the recognition of protection of non-agricultural GIs and traditional, high-quality know-how:
was both a defensive and offensive interest in the framework of the common commercial policy;
fostered innovation and the creation of new start-ups, in particular for small enterprises and micro-enterprises, which were the source
of 80 % of typical locally-made products that could be protected under the geographical indications system;
combatted counterfeit or imitation products;
ensured a more socially, economically and environmentally sustainable approach to economic development inside and outside the
EU;
contributed to fair competition and consumer protection;
help stop the depopulation and destruction of rural areas and the flow of young people leaving these areas.
Parliament recognised the importance of investing in education and training in this field, and encouraged Member States to make optimal use
of the available EU funding and programmes for the support of vocational training for specialists involved in the production and promotion of
environment-friendly local and regional artisanal and industrial products. It also encouraged the Member States to exchange good practices in
creating and supporting initiatives aimed at stimulating the traditional artisanal sector.
Relations with third countries: Members considered that open-ended lists of all products, both agricultural and non-agricultural, that were
protected by geographical indications should be incorporated into future EU trade agreements with non-member countries.
Extending the scope of the GI protection system to cover non-agricultural products could: (i) help make the EUs position on GIs even stronger
and more cogent, in multilateral forums; (ii) stimulate European exports and gain market share while achieving international recognition of the
products in question; (iii) strengthen the Unions hand in the WTO; (iv) be an advantage in negotiating trade agreements with third countries.

(OHIM).
