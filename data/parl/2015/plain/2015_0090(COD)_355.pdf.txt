2015/0090(COD) - 22/04/2015 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to repeal Council Directive 76/621/EEC relating to the fixing of the maximum level of erucic acid in oils and fats and Council
Regulation (EC) No 320/2006 establishing a temporary scheme for the restructuring of the sugar industry.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.

BACKGROUND: the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed in their inter-institutional agreement on better law making
that Community law should be updated and condensed by repealing acts which are no longer applied. Improve transparency and certainty of
Union law is the main aim of this Agreement.
The Commission has carried out several exercises to remove obsolete legislation from the acquis, partly through the traditional repeal
procedure, partly by declaring the relevant Commission acts obsolete.
The Commission identified two Council acts related to the Common Agricultural Policy, which are based upon Article 42 and 43 of the Treaty
(former Articles 36 and 37), which have exhausted all practical effects, but are formally still in force.
CONTENT: for reasons of legal security and clarity, the Commission proposes to repeal two legal acts relating to the common agricultural
policy which have become obsolete, even though formally they are still in force:
Council Directive 76/621/EEC. The content of that Directive has been taken up by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1881/20063;
Council Regulation (EC) No 320/2006. The temporary scheme established by that Regulation was applicable only until the marketing
year 2009/2010.

2015/0090(COD) - 18/09/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development adopted the report by Czes?aw Adam SIEKIERSKI (EPP, PL) on the proposal for a
regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council repealing Council Directive 76/621/EEC relating to the fixing of the maximum level of
erucic acid in oils and fats and Council Regulation (EC) No 320/2006 establishing a temporary scheme for the restructuring of the sugar
industry.
The committee recommended that the European Parliaments position adopted at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure,
should amend the Commission proposal.
Members proposed that the reference to Article 114 TFEU should be added to the reference to Articles 42 and 43(2) in order to enhance
consistency with the double legal basis (Agriculture and Internal market policy) used for the adoption of Directive 76/621/EEC relating to the
fixing of the maximum level of erucic acid in oils and fats.

2015/0090(COD) - 27/10/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 635 votes to 19, with 28 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council repealing Council Directive 76/621/EEC relating to the fixing of the maximum level of erucic acid in
oils and fats and Council Regulation (EC) No 320/2006 establishing a temporary scheme for the restructuring of the sugar industry.
The European Parliaments position adopted at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure, amended the Commission proposal.
Members proposed that the reference to Article 114 TFEU should be added to the reference to Articles 42 and 43(2) concerning proposals
legal base.

2015/0090(COD) - 25/11/2015 Final act
PURPOSE: to repeal two acts relating to the common agriculture policy which have become obsolete.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Regulation (EU) 2015/2284 of the European Parliament and of the Council repealing Council Directive 76/621/EEC
relating to the fixing of the maximum level of erucic acid in oils and fats and Council Regulation (EC) No 320/2006 establishing a temporary
scheme for the restructuring of the sugar industry.
CONTENT: for reasons of legal certainty and clarity, this Regulation repeals two legal acts relating to the common agricultural policy have
become obsolete, even though formally they are still in force:
Council Directive 76/621/EEC: the content of that Directive has been taken up by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006;
Council Regulation (EC) No 320/2006: the temporary scheme established by that Regulation was applicable only until the marketing
year 2009/2010.
Improving the transparency of Union law is an essential element of the better lawmaking strategy that Union institutions are implementing. In
that context it is appropriate to repeal those legal acts which no longer have real effect.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 14.12.2015.
