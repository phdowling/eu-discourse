2015/2285(INI) - 22/02/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs adopted the own-initiative report by Maria João RODRIGUES (S&D, PT) on the European
Semester for economic policy coordination: Annual Growth Survey 2016.
The Committee on Budgets, exercising its prerogatives as an associated committee under Article 54 of the Parliaments internal Rules of
Procedure, was also consulted for an opinion on the report.
This report represents the European Parliaments contribution to the definition of economic policy priorities for the 2016 European Semester
process of policy coordination, responding to the Commissions Annual Growth Survey.
Members stated that economic recovery in the European Union is under way, but recovery remains weak and uneven between and within
Member States. Some Member States face the persistent problem of very low growth rates, whereas net external debt in percentage of GDP

has not decreased in most Member States.
Moreover, Europe still faces an important investment gap. The employment rate is improving but is still insufficient to significantly curb
unemployment, particularly youth and long-term unemployment, as well as poverty.
In this regard, the report made the following recommendations:
Policy mix: Members welcomed the 2016 Annual Growth Survey package and the proposed policy mix of investment, structural reform and
fiscal responsibility, aiming to further promote higher growth levels and strengthen European recovery and upward convergence. They called
for further efforts to support recovery and foster convergence towards the best performers and correct macroeconomic imbalances, including
by increasing productivity and boosting investment.
- Investment: the report called for the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) to be used to maximum effect to support strategic
projects not otherwise financed. These investments should serve a consistent industrial policy and should involve a particular focus on quality
job creation, especially for young people.
The report also stressed the need:
for greater investment in human capital, notably education and innovation, also in the context of labour market reforms;
improve national education, vocational training and lifelong learning systems and to adapt them to the new skill and knowledge
demands of the EU labour market.
Members underlined the need for adequate administrative capacity, an active role for the regions and better coordination at all levels of
government and among them. They also called for available adequate instruments to be made available in order to bring together public and
private financing.
- Structural reforms: Members also stressed the importance of:
sustainable reforms in the product, services and labour markets, as well as in connection with pension schemes, and for better
regulation, which promotes innovation, job creation and welfare-enhancing, fair competition without watering down consumer
protection;
greater resource and energy efficiency, including through the development of the circular economy;
developing further a true Energy Union based on solidarity, efficiency and diversity while not ignoring indigenous energy sources,
including renewable energy;
stimulating quality job creation and creating resilient labour markets with reduced segmentation;
a modern, efficient, democratic and citizen-friendly public administration at all levels of government, as well as for efficient and
transparent public procurement rules;
a greater shift of taxation away from labour, to be decided at national level, while ensuring the sustainability of social protection
systems.
- Fiscal responsibility: Members reiterated the need for responsible, growth-friendly fiscal policies, ensuring debt sustainability and taking
account of the economic cycle and investment gaps, while at the same time respecting citizens social rights. They insisted on:
the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact, while making full use of its existing flexibility clauses, in line with the Commission
communication of 13 January 201, inter alia to support greater investment and structural reforms, as well as to deal with security
threats and refugee inflows;
the need for improving tax collection, combating tax fraud and evasion, enforcing action against aggressive tax planning and tax
havens, as well as for improved tax policy coordination within the EU.
Euro area: Members welcomed the recommendation on the economic policy of the euro area, proposed by the Commission six months before
country-specific recommendations. They considered this as a step towards deepening policy coordination in the follow-up to the Five
Presidents Report and relevant resolutions of the European Parliament.
The report emphasised that, given its high level of interdependence and the singleness of its monetary policy, the euro area is an economic
entity where convergence towards best performers must be promoted and supported by stronger coordination of national policies. It insisted
on full coherence between the euro area recommendation and country-specific recommendations.
Stronger democratic accountability: deploring the poor implementation of country-specific recommendations, Members stated that there is a
need to better identify clearly articulated priorities at European level as well as to increase genuine public debate, political willingness and
commitment at national level, leading to greater relevance and national ownership.
The report underlined that the spring European Council should remain the central moment where policy priorities are defined. It welcomed the
discussion with the Commission in plenary on the Annual Growth Survey priorities before and after its adoption. Members called on the
Council to adopt the euro area recommendations and conclusions on the Annual Growth Survey package after Parliament has been able to
express its views on them. The committee affirmed its resolve to consider these documents swiftly and to take a position well before the Spring
European Council.
The report also highlighted the importance of national parliaments debating country reports and country specific recommendations and voting
on national reform programmes, as well as national convergence or stability programmes. Member States shall aim to involve the social
partners, local and regional authorities and other relevant stakeholders in a structured manner, taking advantage of the early publication of
country reports.
Budgetary policies: Members deplored the fact that there is no satisfactory lever available, given the modest scale of the EU budget and
regretted that it is also impossible to modify the own-resources system. They called on the Commission to carry out the review of the
multiannual financial framework (MFF) which has become inadequate following the financial and humanitarian crises that hit the EU between
2009 and 2014.
Lastly, the report stressed that greater integration within the euro area is indispensable in order to complete economic and monetary union
(EMU), and that budgetary union is a cornerstone of the proper operation of the euro.

2015/2285(INI) - 25/02/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 393 votes to 203, with 50 abstentions, a resolution on the European Semester for economic policy
coordination: Annual Growth Survey 2016.
Policy mix: Parliament welcomed the 2016 Annual Growth Survey package and the proposed policy mix of investment, structural reform and
fiscal responsibility, aiming to further promote higher growth levels and strengthen European recovery and upward convergence. The
resolution:
underlines that major national efforts in terms of effective implementation of structural reforms, as well as stronger European
coordination, are needed to achieve a more robust economic recovery;
proposed that stronger European coordination should be considered in order to support fiscal consolidation without hindering growth,
given that public debt ratios continue to rise in several Member States;
called for domestic demand to be strengthened in order to make Europes economy more resilient;
called for further efforts to support recovery and foster convergence towards the best performers and correct macroeconomic
imbalances, including by increasing productivity and boosting investment;
called for a strengthening of the role of the Europe 2020 Strategy in guiding the European Semester.
- Investment: Parliament called for the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) to be used to maximum effect to support strategic
projects not otherwise financed. These investments should serve a consistent industrial policy and should involve a particular focus on quality
job creation, especially for young people.
The resolution also stressed the need:
implement rapidly the banking union and bank structural reform, as well as boosting equity investments in SMEs thanks to a Capital
Markets Union;
for greater investment in human capital, notably education and innovation, also in the context of labour market reforms;
improve national education, vocational training and lifelong learning systems and to adapt them to the new skill and knowledge
demands of the EU labour market.
Members underlined the need for adequate administrative capacity, an active role for the regions and better coordination at all levels of
government and among them. They also called for available adequate instruments to be made available in order to bring together public and
private financing.
- Structural reforms: Parliament also stressed the importance of:
sustainable reforms in the product, services and labour markets, as well as in connection with pension schemes, and for better
regulation, which promotes innovation, job creation and welfare-enhancing, fair competition without watering down consumer
protection;
greater resource and energy efficiency, including through the development of the circular economy;
developing further a true Energy Union based on solidarity, efficiency and diversity while not ignoring indigenous energy sources,
including renewable energy;
stimulating quality job creation and creating resilient labour markets with reduced segmentation;
a modern, efficient, democratic and citizen-friendly public administration at all levels of government, as well as for efficient and
transparent public procurement rules;
a greater shift of taxation away from labour, to be decided at national level, while ensuring the sustainability of social protection
systems.
- Fiscal responsibility: Members reiterated the need for responsible, growth-friendly fiscal policies, ensuring debt sustainability and taking
account of the economic cycle and investment gaps, while at the same time respecting citizens social rights. They insisted on:
the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact, while making full use of its existing flexibility clauses, in line with the Commission
communication of 13 January 201, inter alia to support greater investment and structural reforms, as well as to deal with security
threats and refugee inflows;
the need for improving tax collection, combating tax fraud and evasion, enforcing action against aggressive tax planning and tax
havens, as well as for improved tax policy coordination within the EU.
Euro area: Parliament emphasised that, given its high level of interdependence and the singleness of its monetary policy, the euro area is an
economic entity where convergence towards best performers must be promoted and supported by stronger coordination of national policies. It
insisted on full coherence between the euro area recommendation and country-specific recommendations.
Members also acknowledged the role of the single currency in helping more competitive countries to maintain high surpluses vis-à-vis the rest
of the world. They emphasised the need to: (i) foster real economic and social convergence driven by improvements in productivity and
non-cost factors; (ii) ensure both responsible and growth-friendly wage developments; (iii) provide measures preventing a race to the bottom in
terms of taxation and social standards, which leads to an increase in inequalities.
Environment, Public Health and Food Safety policies: Parliament recommended that the principles of the circular economy should be
integrated into country-specific recommendations and reiterated the need the need for a fiscal framework that rewards development of
sustainable policies. It also considered it important to assess the performance and sustainability of healthcare systems in the framework of the
European Semester.
Stronger democratic accountability: deploring the poor implementation of country-specific recommendations, Parliament stated that there is a
need to better identify clearly articulated priorities at European level as well as to increase genuine public debate, political willingness and
commitment at national level, leading to greater relevance and national ownership.
Members underlined that the spring European Council should remain the central moment where policy priorities are defined. They recalled that
the setting of the economic policy following the recommendation by the Council to the Member States is an executive act which needs to be
subjected to democratic scrutiny and debate by the European Parliament. They welcomed, therefore, the discussion with the Commission in

plenary on the Annual Growth Survey priorities before and after its adoption. Parliament called on the Council to adopt the euro area
recommendations and conclusions on the Annual Growth Survey package after Parliament has been able to express its views on them. It
affirmed its resolve to consider these documents swiftly and to take a position well before the Spring European Council.
The resolution also highlighted the importance of national parliaments debating country reports and country specific recommendations and
voting on national reform programmes, as well as national convergence or stability programmes. Member States shall aim to involve the social
partners, local and regional authorities and other relevant stakeholders in a structured manner, taking advantage of the early publication of
country reports.
Budgetary policies: Parliament deplored the fact that there is no satisfactory lever available and regretted that it is impossible to modify the
own-resources system. The EU budget could help relieve the strain on national budgets and bolster fiscal consolidation efforts by providing
own resources as well as rationalising expenditure. The Commission is called upon to carry out the review of the multiannual financial
framework (MFF) which has become inadequate following the financial and humanitarian crises that hit the EU between 2009 and 2014.
Lastly, the resolution stressed that greater integration within the euro area is indispensable in order to complete economic and monetary union
(EMU), and that budgetary union is a cornerstone of the proper operation of the euro.
