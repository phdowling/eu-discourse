Summary

The European Parliament adopted by 550 votes to 14 with 60 abstentions, a resolution on Angola.
The resolution was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ECR, Greens/EFA, ALDE, and GUE/NGL groups.
Deeply concerned about the fast deteriorating situation in terms of human rights, fundamental freedoms and democratic space in
Angola, Members called on the Angolan authorities to immediately and unconditionally release all human rights defenders, including Marcos
Mavungo and the 15+1 activists arrested in June 2015.
They also called on the Angolan authorities to immediately put an end to cases of arbitrary arrest, illegal detentions and torture by the police
and security forces.
Gravely concerned by the continuous attempts to limit fundamental freedom in Angola, Members asked the EU Delegation in Luanda to
protect human rights defenders (HRDs) worldwide through concrete, visible steps. They further asked the Delegation to step up the political
dialogue with the Angolan Government in all political, trade and development relations, to ensure that the latter upheld its national and
international human rights commitments.
Corruption and EU action: Members called on the EU and Member States to acknowledge the high level of corruption by the Angolan
authorities, and to review the focal sectors of its National Indicative Programme under the 11th EDF.
They urged the EU to monitor, control and evaluate the effective use of funds and to ensure that the allocated budget was used in an efficient
and targeted manner so that land was cleared, as it should be.
Ending violence: Parliament remained concerned that measures to combat violence against women and children had not been implemented. It
called on the authorities to strengthen the fight against harmful traditional practices, such as the stigmatisation of children accused of sorcery.
It went on to recall the commitment made by Angola under the Cotonou Agreement to respect democracy, the rule of law and human rights
principles and urged the Angolan Government to uphold these provisions.
Natural resources: Members urged the EU and Member States to address the transparency of trade in all natural resources, including oil, and
notably to fully implement and monitor the existing legislation on country-by-country reporting. They called on the Angolan authorities and
foreign companies to help strengthen governance in the extractive sector by abiding by the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative and to
review the implementation of the Kimberley Process.
At the same time, Parliament called on Member States national administrations and supervisory authorities to step up vigilance of compliance
with European anti-money laundering legislation, including due diligence normative principles and proper risk analysis, especially involving
Politically Exposed Persons originating from Angola.
Land seizure: lastly, Members welcomed the Angolan Governments acknowledgement of problems in relation to compensation in cases of
land seizure, and welcomed the media reports that suggested that the distribution and compensation mechanisms were improving. They
encouraged the Government to continue its efforts in this direction.
