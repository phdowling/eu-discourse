Summary

2015/2969(RSP) - 26/11/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 567 votes to 27, against 36 abstentions, a resolution on the political situation in Cambodia.
The text adopted in plenary was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ECR, ALDE, GUE/NGL, Greens/EFA and EFDD groups.
Parliament expressed its deep concern about the worsening climate for opposition politicians and activists, and human rights, social and
environmental activists in Cambodia. It condemned all acts of violence and politically motivated charges, sentences and convictions against
opposition politicians, activists and human rights defenders in Cambodia.
It urged the Cambodian authorities to revoke the arrest warrant and drop all charges issued against opposition leader Sam Rainsy , leader of
the main opposition party, and the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) members of the National Assembly and Senate and CNRP
activists and organisers.
Parliament advocated the culture of dialogue between the leaders of the Cambodian Peoples Party (CPP) and CNRP and called on the
Government of Cambodia and the opposition to engage in a serious and meaningful dialogue.
The Government of Cambodia is urged to:
recognise the legitimate and useful role played by civil society, trade unions and the political opposition in contributing to Cambodias
overall economic and political development;
work towards strengthening democracy and the rule of law and to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms;
ensure the security of all democratically elected representatives of Cambodia, irrespective of their political affiliation;
abrogate the Law on Associations and Non-Governmental Organisations, the recent promulgation of which has given state authorities
arbitrary powers to shut down and block the creation of human rights organisations;
ensure genuine and serious consultation with all those affected by draft legislation such as the Trade Union, Cybercrime and
Telecommunications Laws and to ensure that the texts are in line with Cambodias human rights obligations and commitments under
domestic and international law;
end arbitrary detentions and suspicious disappearances and allow voluntary and human rights organisations to operate freely.
Parliament recalled that the EU is Cambodias largest partner in terms of development assistance, with a new allocation for the 2014-2020
period of EUR 410 million. It called on the Member States, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the
European External Action Service and the Commission to immediately raise the above concerns and recommendations with the Cambodian
authorities.
