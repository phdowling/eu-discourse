2015/2038(INI) - 27/06/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on International Trade adopted the own-initiative report by Eleonora FORENZA (Greens/EFA, IT) on the implementation of the
2010 recommendations of Parliament on social and environmental standards, human rights and corporate responsibility.
Parliament acts as a co-legislator with respect to measures defining the framework for implementing the Unions common commercial policy
(CCP). Its consent is required for the ratification of every trade agreement negotiated by the Union. The implementation of Parliaments
recommendations is therefore necessary to ensure the success of any initiative undertaken by the Commission in the field of the CCP.
The report recalled that Parliament issued recommendations to the Commission relating to social and environmental standards, human rights
and corporate responsibility in 2010. It noted that although a number of these recommendations have been implemented, others have not.
General principles: the report called on:
the Commission and Member States to incorporate a gender-mainstreaming approach into all their policies and to assess existing
trade and investment agreements systematically in order to identify their consequences on gender equality;
the Commission to ensure greater coherence with respect to development, to ensure effective policy assessment and coordination
between development aid and trade policy;

the EU and the Member States to promote binding measures to ensure that companies pay taxes where economic activities take
place and value is created, to promote compulsory country-by-country reporting by the private sector as recommended by the OECD,
and to promote good governance notably in tax matters and effective tax collection;
the Commission and Member States to ensure that this issue is given priority on the agenda in its policy dialogue (at political level on
development and on trade) and to support the role of civil society in ensuring public scrutiny of tax governance and monitoring of
cases concerning tax fraud.
The report recommended that the EUs trade strategy be a tool for the promotion of democratic values in third countries. Members welcomed
the enhancement of trade agreements and trade preference programmes as levers to promote human rights, eliminate forced and child labour,
and ensure food security and the rights to health, sustainable development and high safety and environmental standards, as well as economic
opportunities for all.
Human rights, environmental and social standards at multilateral level: stressing how important it is for the EU to build cooperation at
multilateral level, Members reiterated their call to the Commission to take a leading role in the reform of WTO governance, in particular with
respect to achieving the following objectives: (i) to strengthen effective cooperation and regular dialogue between the WTO and the relevant
UN agencies; (ii) to reform WTO trade policy review mechanisms to include the social, environmental and HR dimensions.
Member States are called upon to step up their efforts to honour their commitment to phase out subsidies for fossil fuels in line with the G20
commitment. Members called for the development of quantitative or qualitative criteria to identify 'green goods' and for due account to be taken
of factors influencing trade in these goods.
Human rights, environmental and social standards at bilateral level: while welcoming the Commissions decision to carry out ex ante and ex
post sustainability impact assessments (SIAs) for all trade agreements, Members called on the Commission to:
apply the guidelines in developing SIAs for all current and future negotiations;
take into account the impact of trade and investment agreements on particularly vulnerable people such as those who belong to a
minority group, or are geographically isolated, poor or socially excluded;
set up a reporting system that enables Parliament to assess the work of the Domestic Advisory Groups (DAGs);
respond systematically in a concrete manner to concerns raised by EU DAGs and to follow up on initiatives proposed by EU SCOs
and social partners in this framework;
involve Parliament more closely in the process of monitoring the implementation of trade and investment agreements with regard to
compliance with human rights and social and environmental standards. The Council should consult Parliament on any decisions to
revise or even suspend the application of an agreement if this is necessary.
Human rights, environmental and social standards at unilateral level: Members welcomed the entry into force of the new Generalised Scheme
of Preferences (GSP) (Regulation (EU) No 978/2012) on 1 January 2014 and the publication of the first GSP monitoring report for the period
2014-2015. They stated that trade policy must be a way to encourage the EUs partner countries to adopt higher social and environmental
standards and therefore called on the Commission to implement specific corrective measures.
Members reiterated their request from 2010 for a balanced and realistic proposal for legislation, including measures such as labelling
child-labour-free products, trade preferences given to countries that meet certain labour standards and horizontal import prohibitions for
products made using child labour.
They stressed the importance of including the objective of combating forced labour and child labour in TSD chapters of EU trade agreements.
They confirmed their opposition to any direct or indirect provision affecting trade in energy-related services that would allow for technological
neutrality of subsidies.
Corporate social responsibility (CSR): Members recalled Parliaments request from 2010 to include CSR in all EU trade agreements and
provisions for greater enforcement, notably the possibility for the Commission to carry out investigations into alleged breaches of CSR
commitments and the development of EU contact points building on and strengthening the OECD contact points.
The Commission is called upon to ensure transparency with regard to access to information on the conduct of enterprises and to introduce an
effective and enforceable reporting system which provides information on product value chains.
CSR dialogue platforms should be created to bring together civil society, businesses, international organisations and other stakeholders.
Recalling that the EU is the worlds leading actor in terms of National Action Plans for CSR, Members called on the Commission to actively
promote responsible business conduct amongst EU companies operating abroad, with a special focus on ensuring strict compliance with all
their legal obligations stemming from either domestic laws or any bilateral or international legal obligations that their business operations are
subject to therein not least compliance with international standards and rules in the areas of human rights, labour and the environment.
The Commission is called upon to take trade and investment measures involving the award of labels, the granting of preferential access to EU
public contracts and the implementation of SME support programmes that will encourage and reward companies introducing CSR strategies.
Lastly, Members stressed that the effective implementation of these recommendations constitutes a crucial element in Parliaments
assessment of trade agreements negotiated by the Commission. They requested a detailed and timely response from the Commission to all
the items raised in this resolution.

2015/2038(INI) - 05/07/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 556 votes to 103, with 53 abstentions, a resolution on the implementation of the 2010 recommendations
of Parliament on social and environmental standards, human rights and corporate responsibility.
Members recalled that Parliament acts as a co-legislator with respect to measures defining the framework for implementing the Unions
common commercial policy (CCP). Its consent is required for the ratification of every trade agreement negotiated by the Union. The
implementation of Parliaments recommendations is therefore necessary to ensure the success of any initiative undertaken by the Commission
in the field of the CCP.

Parliament issued recommendations to the Commission relating to social and environmental standards, human rights and corporate

and ensure food security and the rights to health, sustainable development and high safety and environmental standards, as well as economic
opportunities for all.
The Commission should take a leading role in the reform of WTO governance, in particular with respect to putting in place a regular dialogue
between the WTO and the relevant UN agencies, notably the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the UN Conference for Trade and
Development and the International Labour Organisation, in particular by granting the ILO observer status in the WTO.
Parliament called on the Commission to actively promote further reforms of the WTO in order to define multilateral rules for the sustainable
management of global supply chains in a responsible way, which should in particular include:
effective and enforceable supply chain due diligence and transparency requirements, building from the UN Guiding Principles for
Business and Human Rights,
health and safety standards, recognising in particular the right of workers to safety committees,
a social protection floor,
respect for ILO core labour standards.
Member States are called upon to step up their efforts to honour their commitment to phase out subsidies for fossil fuels in line with the G20
commitment. Members called for the development of quantitative or qualitative criteria to identify 'green goods' and for due account to be taken
of factors influencing trade in these goods.
At bilateral level: while welcoming the Commissions decision to carry out ex ante and ex post sustainability impact assessments (SIAs) for all
trade agreements, Members called on the Commission to:
apply the guidelines in developing SIAs for all current and future negotiations;
take into account the impact of trade and investment agreements on particularly vulnerable people such as those who belong to a
minority group, or are geographically isolated, poor or socially excluded;
ensure proper involvement of civil society organisations and social partners in the development of SIAs and to involve Parliament at
every stage in this process.
Parliament reiterated its support for human rights conditionality in trade agreements and recalled the importance of respecting and
implementing human rights clauses. It suggested:
considering the inclusion of a committee for human rights in all EU trade agreements in order to ensure serious and systematic
follow-up on human rights issues in relation to the agreement;
putting in place sustainable development forums or advisory groups at the various stages of drafting, negotiating and implementing an
agreement;
involving Parliament more closely in the process of monitoring the implementation of trade and investment agreements with regard to
compliance with human rights and social and environmental standards. The Council should consult Parliament on any decisions to
revise or even suspend the application of an agreement if this is necessary.
At unilateral level: Parliament welcomed the entry into force of the new Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP) (Regulation (EU) No
