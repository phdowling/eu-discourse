Summary

2015/2090(INI) - 26/02/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Fisheries adopted the initiative report by Rua TOMAI? (ECR, HR) on innovation and diversification of small-scale coastal
fishing in fisheries dependent regions.
Coastal fishing accounts for 80 % of the European fleet. Together with shellfishing, it guarantees a high level of employment in coastal areas,
islands and the outermost regions, and generally represents a socially and environmentally sustainable form of fishing that has considerable
potential. Coastal fishing is a traditional form of fishing that forms a way of life and a significant source of livelihood.
Specificities of coastal fishing: Members called on the Commission to adapt the definition of coastal, small-scale coastal and traditional fishing
in line with the socio-economic characteristics and specificities of the different regions, rather than solely according to the dimensions and
power of fishing vessels, since the current EU regulations are not satisfactory.
Member proposed to:
make use of regionalisation in order to adapt the definition of coastal fishing on a case-by-case basis in line with the specificities of
each fishery;
take into account a number of indicative criteria such as the size of the vessels, the fishing gears used, the selectivity of fishing
techniques, the lengths of the fishing trips and whether the owner of the vessel is on board, the traditional formulas of
entrepreneurship and the property and business structures traditionally operating in these areas.
The Commission is called upon to:
consider the possibility of small-scale coastal fishing in island communities which traditionally depend on fishing for their own
livelihood, and are engaged in fishing activities throughout the year;
gradually increase the quotas allocated to non-industrial fisheries, in order to boost this socially and ecologically sustainable form of
fishing;
support innovative projects and legal provisions that facilitate the development of the coastal, island and outermost regions, by giving
priority to projects that focus on sustainable job creation and retention, the increasing involvement of the extractive sector in
processing and sales, the promotion of entrepreneurship formulas linked to social economy, the promotion of short market chains, the
introduction of new technologies in the promotion and sale of fishing goods and services, innovation in the development of new goods
and services, and maintaining and protecting traditional roles;
coordinate an investigation at European level to ascertain the impact of recreational coastal fishing on traditional fishing activities and
also to define the parameters that are required in order to reduce recreational coastal fishing in some areas;
implement the necessary measures to support the various groups of women in the maritime sector so as to encourage their
participation and ensure they are represented in all areas, both in decision-making roles and fishing activities;
promote and drive the founding and the work of Fisheries Local Action Groups (FLAGs) by increasing economic resources, since
these groups are providing continued support and advice directly to the fisheries sector and thus promoting a socially inclusive
sustainable development model in fishing areas;
help strengthen the role of fisheries communities in local development and the governance of local fisheries resources and maritime
activities.
Member States should give priority to small-scale coastal fishing when granting European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) funding and to
streamline procedures for operators of those types of fisheries.
The Commission should be accountable to the Parliament in respect of the action plans for the development, competitiveness and
sustainability of small-scale coastal fishing drawn up by the Member States for the purposes of the EMFF.
Diversification of fisheries: in this regard, Members called on the Commission to encourage investment in the diversification of fisheries in
order to:
develop complementary activities and the versatility of careers in fisheries, including investments in vessels, safety equipment,

training, environmental services in the fisheries sector activities, and cultural and educational activities;
boost the creation and development of fishing tourism, to actively promote and support investment in the diversification of fisheries in
the area of culture and art as part of traditional heritage (handicrafts, music and dance) and to support investment in the promotion of
tradition, history and fishing heritage in general (fishing gears, techniques, historical documents, etc.);
boost the development of local distribution channels, the promotion of these products through the creation of local distinctive signs
and/or trademarks for fresh products and by supporting the creation of local business projects.
The Commission should support the introduction of fresh produce obtained through non-industrial fishing, shellfishing and small-scale,
sustainable, extensive aquaculture to public eating establishments (educational institutions, hospitals, restaurants, etc.).
Legislative initiatives: Members recommended the Commission to give the highest importance to the socio-economic relevance of artisanal
coastal fishing and small-scale fishing within the EU. THe Commission should also:
use a selective approach when developing legislative proposals on the use of fishing gears and techniques so as to take into account
the actual impact that these gears and techniques have on non-industrial fishing resources in each of the relevant areas;
ensure that any legislative initiatives are subject to a thorough prior impact assessment taking account of the specific factors that apply
in each fishing area.
Lastly, Members stressed the need for an amendment to Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006 concerning management measures for the
sustainable exploitation of fishery resources in the Mediterranean Sea, also known as the Mediterranean Regulation, which was adopted in
2006 and which lays down rules on the technical characteristics of fishing gears and their uses, in order to bring into line with the new
Common Fisheries Policy.

2015/2090(INI) - 12/04/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 669 votes to 31, with 1 abstention, a resolution on innovation and diversification of small-scale coastal
fishing in fisheries dependent regions.
Coastal fishing accounts for 80 % of the European fleet. Together with shellfishing, it guarantees a high level of employment in coastal areas,
islands and the outermost regions, and generally represents a socially and environmentally sustainable form of fishing that has considerable

these groups are providing continued support and advice directly to the fisheries sector and thus promoting a socially inclusive
sustainable development model in fishing areas;
help strengthen the role of fisheries communities in local development and the governance of local fisheries resources and maritime
activities;
provide support as part of initiatives for the direct management of project financing, in which emphasis is placed on coastal fisheries
and the development of coastal regions.
Member States should give priority to small-scale coastal fishing when granting European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) funding and to
streamline procedures for operators of those types of fisheries. The Commission should be accountable to the Parliament in respect of the
action plans for the development, competitiveness and sustainability of small-scale coastal fishing drawn up by the Member States for the

Diversification of fisheries: in this regard, Parliament called on the Commission to encourage investment in the diversification of fisheries in
order to:
develop complementary activities and the versatility of careers in fisheries, including investments in vessels, safety equipment,
training, environmental services in the fisheries sector activities, and cultural and educational activities;

boost the creation and development of fishing tourism, to actively promote and support investment in the diversification of fisheries in
the area of culture and art as part of traditional heritage;
support nautical sporting activities in order to strengthen local communities;
boost the development of local distribution channels, the promotion of these products through the creation of local distinctive signs
and/or trademarks for fresh products and by supporting the creation of local business projects.
Environmental protection: Members considered that anthropogenic influences, i.e. human activities, in coastal regions have been
underestimated in the context of environmental protection issues and the cumulative effects of various activities on coastal regions have not
been adequately recognised or assessed. They urged the Member-States and the Commission to evaluate the environmental impact of any
activities that could affect the sustainability of fish stocks, such as maritime transport, waste, transport, aquifer pollution, drilling activities or the
construction of new tourist facilities along the coast, in accordance with the precautionary principle.
Legislative initiatives: Members recommended the Commission to give the highest importance to the socio-economic relevance of artisanal
coastal fishing and small-scale fishing within the EU. The Commission should also:
use a selective approach when developing legislative proposals on the use of fishing gears and techniques so as to take into account
the actual impact that these gears and techniques have on non-industrial fishing resources in each of the relevant areas;
ensure that any legislative initiatives are subject to a thorough prior impact assessment taking account of the specific factors that apply
in each fishing area.
The Commission is called upon to amend the provision on the technical specifications for fishing nets, such as the minimal mesh size, the
height of the net, the distance from the coast and depth at which nets may be used in order to ensure a more balanced harvesting of fish
stocks and to preserve biodiversity.
Lastly, Parliament stressed the need for an amendment to Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006 concerning management measures for the
sustainable exploitation of fishery resources in the Mediterranean Sea, also known as the Mediterranean Regulation, which was adopted in
2006 and which lays down rules on the technical characteristics of fishing gears and their uses, in order to bring into line with the new
Common Fisheries Policy.
