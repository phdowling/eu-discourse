2015/0076(NLE) - 07/04/2015 Initial legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude, on behalf of the European Union, the Amending Protocol to the Agreement between the European Community and
Switzerland providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in Council Directive 2003/48/EC on taxation of savings income in the form of
interest payments.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: following the adoption of Council Directive 2003/48/EC, the Savings Directive, and in order to preserve the level playing field
of economic operators, the EU signed Agreements with Switzerland providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in the Directive.
The importance of automatic exchange of information as a means to combat cross-border tax fraud and tax evasion by ensuring full tax
transparency and cooperation between tax administrations worldwide has also been recognised at the international level. The Organisation for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) was mandated by the G20 to develop a single global standard for automatic exchange of
financial account information. The Global Standard was released by the OECD Council in July 2014.
On the basis of a proposal presented by the Commission in June 2013, the Council adopted Directive 2014/107/EU amending Directive
2011/16/EU and extending the mandatory automatic exchange of information between EU tax authorities to a full range of financial items in
accordance with the Global Standard.
As Directive 2014/107/EU is generally broader in scope than Directive 2003/48/EC and provides that in cases of overlap of scope, Directive
2014/107/EU prevails, on 18 March 2015 the Commission adopted a proposal to repeal Directive 2003/48/EC.
Therefore, the Commission considers it crucial to ensure that the amendment of the existing Savings Agreement with Switzerland is in line with
EU and international developments. This will increase tax transparency in Europe and will be the legal basis for implementing the OCDE
Global Standard on automatic exchange of information between Switzerland and the EU.
CONTENT: under this proposal, the Council is invited to approve, on behalf of the European Union, the Amending Protocol to the Agreement
between the European Community and Switzerland providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in Council Directive 2003/48/EC on
taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments.
The Amending Protocol seeks to implement the OECD Global Standard between EU Member States and Switzerland. It introduces a new set
of provisions comprising 11 Articles, an Annex I that reflects the OECD Common Reporting Standard which is part of the Global Standard, an
Annex II that reflects important parts of the OECD Commentaries to the Global Standard and an Annex III that lists the Competent Authorities
of Switzerland and of each Member State.
The new Articles reflect the articles of the OECD Model Competent Authority agreement for the implementation of the Global Standard. They
include, inter alia:
a full set of provisions on exchange of information upon request that follows the latest text of the OECD Model Tax Convention;
a more detailed set of provisions on data protection;
provisions on amendments to the Agreement, including a quick mechanism for provisional application by one of the Contracting
Parties of amendments to the Global Standard, on the condition of consent by the other Party.
Moreover, the Amending Protocol:
deals with issues on the transition from the existing Agreement to the amended Agreement, with regard to requests for information,
credits available to beneficial owners for withholding tax, final payments of withholding tax by Switzerland to Member States and final
exchange of information under the voluntary disclosure mechanism;
contains a Protocol on additional safeguards related to the exchange of information on request, which Switzerland includes in its tax
treaties. The text specifies that exchanges on the basis of a group request are not prevented. The Protocol on additional safeguards is
in line with the Global Forum?s Terms of Reference for exchange of information on request.
The revised Agreement is supplemented by four Joint Declarations of the contracting parties and one Unilateral Declaration by Switzerland.

2015/0076(NLE) - 15/06/2015 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: the conclusion of the Amending Protocol to the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation,
providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in Council Directive 2003/48/EC on taxation of savings income in the form of interest
payments.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
CONTENT: the proposal for a Council Decision seeks the approval, on behalf of the European Union, of the Amending Protocol to the
Agreement between the European Union and the Swiss Confederation providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in Council
Directive 2003/48/EC on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments.
The text of the Amending Protocol aligns the Agreement with the latest developments at international level concerning automatic exchange of

information, namely the Global Standard for automatic exchange of financial account information in tax matters developed by the Organisation
for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The Union, its Member States and the Swiss Confederation have actively participated in
the work of the OECD.
For further details of the Amending Protocol, please refer to the summary of the Commission?s initial legislative procedure dated 7.4.2015.

2015/0076(NLE) - 30/09/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs adopted the report by Jeppe KOFOD (S&D, DK) on the draft Council decision on the
conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Amending Protocol to the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss
Confederation providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in Council Directive 2003/48/EC on taxation of savings income in the form
of interest payments.
The committee recommended the Parliament to approve the draft Council decision as amended and approves conclusion of the agreement.
Members regretted however that no improvements can be made, particularly regarding information provided and the automatic, binding and
unrestricted nature of exchanges of information.
They called on the Commission to keep the Parliament informed in case of any change or new development in the final steps of the conclusion
of this agreement.
Members stressed the importance of taking effective action against fraud and tax avoidance and in particular tax evasion and tax avoidance by
natural and legal persons based in the Union with the involvement of financial institutions based in third countries.
The Commission is called upon to assess, 18 months after the date of entry into force of this Agreement, the application of this Agreement and
its outcome, and present a report to the European Parliament and the Council, accompanied where appropriate by proposals for its review.

conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Amending Protocol to the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss
Confederation providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in Council Directive 2003/48/EC on taxation of savings income in the form
of interest payments.

stipulated that the President of the Council shall, on behalf of the Union, give the notification provided for in the Amending Protocol4 in order to
ensure that the rules on automatic exchange of information with respect to reportable accounts are being followed and collaboration on
compliance and enforcement is enabled.
Parliament regretted that no improvements can be made, particularly regarding information provided and the automatic, binding and
unrestricted nature of exchanges of information.
In it resolution, it:
called upon the Commission to keep Parliament informed in case of any change or new development in the final steps of the
conclusion of the Amending Protocol to the Agreement;
reminded the Council of its obligation to consult Parliament once more should it modify its draft decision;
stressed the importance of taking effective action against fraud and tax avoidance and in particular tax evasion and tax avoidance by
natural and legal persons based in the Union with the involvement of financial institutions based in third countries;
called upon the Commission to assess, 18 months after the date of entry into force of the Amending Protocol to the Agreement, the
application of the Agreement and its outcome, and present a report to the European Parliament and the Council, accompanied where
appropriate by proposals for its review.

2015/0076(NLE) - 08/12/2015 Final act

tax administrations to extend the automatic exchange of information and to improve cross-border access to information on private savers.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Council Decision (EU) 2015/2400 on the conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Amending Protocol to
the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in
Council Directive 2003/48/EC on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments.
CONTENT: by this Decision, the Council approves the Amending Protocol to the Agreement between the European Community
and Switzerland providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in Council Directive 2003/48/EC on taxation of savings income in the

overlap with Directive 2014/107/EU, which includes strengthened provisions to prevent tax evasion.

(OECD).
