2015/2165(DEC) - 23/07/2015 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: presentation by the Commission of the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2014, as part of
the 2014 discharge procedure.
Analysis of the accounts of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (EUROFOUND).
CONTENT: this Commission document sets out the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2014 as
prepared on the basis of the information presented by the institutions, organisations and bodies of the EU, in accordance with Article 148(2) of
the Financial Regulation applicable to the EU's General Budget, including the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and
Working Conditions (EUROFOUND).
The document contains the figures on which the discharge procedure is based.
On this basis, the Financial Controller of the European Commission ensures the certification of the consolidated accounts as declared by the
institutions, agencies and bodies of the European Union.
Discharge procedure of the EU agencies: the EU Budget finances a wide range of policies and programmes throughout the EU. In accordance
with the priorities set by the European Parliament and the Council in the multi-annual financial framework (MFF), the European Commission
carries out specific programmes, activities and projects in the field with the technical support of some specialised agencies.
The consolidated annual accounts of the EU provide information on the activities of the institutions, agencies and other bodies of the EU from
a budgetary and accrual accounting perspective.
The consolidated reports on the implementation of the general budget of the EU include the budget implementation of all Institutions. Agencies
do not have a separate budget inside the EU budget; and they are partially financed by a Commission budget subsidy.

This document sets out how the Agencies spent and implemented their budget in 2014. Each agency is subject to its own discharge
procedure.
EUROFOUND: in 2014, the tasks and budget of this agency were as follows:
description of the Foundation's tasks: the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, which is
located in Dublin, was set up by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1365/75. Its aim is to contribute to the planning and establishment of
better living and working conditions in the Union by increasing and disseminating knowledge which is relevant to this subject;
the Foundation's budget for the 2014 financial year: the Foundations budget for 2014, as presented in the Commission document on
the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union, gives the following figures:
Commitment appropriations:
- committed : EUR 22 million;
- paid : EUR 21 million;
- carried-over : 1 million.
Payment appropriations:
- committed : EUR 26 million;
- paid : EUR 21 million;
- carried-over : EUR 5 million.
Please refer also to the final accounts of the Foundation.

2015/2165(DEC) - 08/09/2015 Court of Auditors: opinion, report
PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living
and Working Conditions (EUROFOUND) for the financial year 2014, together with the Foundations reply.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit concerned, amongst others, the annual accounts of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions
(EUROFOUND).
Statement of Assurance: pursuant to the provisions of Article 287 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the Court
has audited:
the annual accounts of the Foundation, which comprise the financial statements and the reports on the implementation of the budget
for the financial year ended 31 December 2014;
the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying those accounts.
Opinion on the reliability of the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the Foundations annual accounts present fairly, in all material respects, its
financial position as at 31 December 2014 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the
provisions of its Financial Regulation and the accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
Opinion on the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the accounts: the Court considers that the transactions underlying the
annual accounts for the year ended 31 December 2014 are legal and regular in all material respects.
The report also makes a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of the Foundation, accompanied by the latters
response. The main observations may be summarised as follows:
The Courts observations:
budgetary management: the Court notes that in 2014, the overall level of committed appropriations was high at 99.7 %, indicating that
commitments were made in a timely manner. However, the level of committed appropriations carried over to 2015 was high for
operational expenditure at 53.7 %. This relates mainly to multiannual projects;
remuneration: the Court specifies that in 2005 new EU Staff Regulations entered into force, including provisions that future
remunerations of officials recruited before 5 August 2005 should not be less than under the previous EU Staff Regulations. The Courts
audit revealed that this was not complied with and, in the case of 20 of the 75 officials employed at that time, this led to a total
underpayment of EUR 1 28 735 for the period 2005 to 2014. The Foundations accounts include a provision for this amount.
The Foundations replies:
budgetary management: the Foundation appreciates the thorough analysis of the budget implementation and for mentioning the
reasons for the carry-overs;
remunerations: the Foundation indicates that the problem raised by the Court has now been resolved.
Lastly, the Court of Auditors report contains a summary of the Agencys activities in 2014. This is focused on the following:
Budget: EUR 20.9 million.
Activities:

increasing labour market participation and combating unemployment by creating jobs, improving labour market functioning and
promoting integration, including activities relating to the European Restructuring Monitor (ERM);
improving working conditions and making work sustainable throughout the life course, including the establishment of the European
Observatory of Working Life as an integrated observatory on industrial relations and working conditions in the EU and publication of
reports on this topic;
developing industrial relations to ensure equitable and productive solutions in a changing policy context, and publishing a report on
industrial relations and working conditions developments in Europe 2013;
improving standards of living and promoting social cohesion in the face of economic disparities and social inequalities with the
publication of the third European Quality of Life Survey;
communication and sharing ideas including 1 01 760 downloads of reports from Eurofound website, 125 publications in PDF, 328 EU
policy documents quoting references to Eurofound findings and expertise, and 94 on-request contributions to events.

2015/2165(DEC) - 27/01/2016 Supplementary non-legislative basic document
Having examined the revenue and expenditure accounts for the financial year 2014 and the balance sheet as at 31 December 2014 of the
European Foundation for the improvement of living and working conditions (Eurofound), as well as the Court of Auditors' report on the annual
accounts of the Foundation for the financial year 2014, accompanied by the Foundation's replies to the Court's observations, the Council
recommended the European Parliament to give a discharge to the Director of the Foundation in respect of the implementation of the budget for
the financial year 2014.
The Council welcomed the Court's opinion that, in all material respects, the Foundation's annual accounts present fairly its financial position as
at 31 December 2014 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions of the
Foundation's Financial Regulation, and that the underlying transactions for 2014 are legal and regular in all material respects.
Nevertheless, the Council has made some observations which may be summarised as follows:
financial programming: while acknowledging the multiannual nature of many of the Foundation's projects, the Council noted, that a
high level of commitment appropriations was carried over to 2015. The Council invites the Foundation to continue improving its
financial programming and monitoring of the budget implementation, in order to reduce the level of commitments carried over to the
following financial year to the strict minimum, in line with the budgetary principle of annuality;
staff remuneration: lastly, the Council noted the Court's observation that the Foundation has not complied with certain of the Staff
Regulations' provisions on remuneration and welcomed the Foundation's corrective action in cooperation with the Office for the
Administration and Payment of Individual Entitlements.

2015/2165(DEC) - 08/04/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Derek VAUGHAN (S&D, UK) on discharge in respect of the implementation of the
budget of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound) for the financial year 2014.
The parliamentary committee calls on the European Parliament to grant the Director of the Foundation discharge in respect of the
implementation of the Foundations budget for the financial year 2014.
Noting that the Court of Auditors issued a statement of assurance as to the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the
underlying transactions for the financial year 2014, Members call on Parliament to approve the closure of the Foundations accounts. They
made, however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is granted, in addition to the general
recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies:
·

Foundations financial statements: Members note the final budget of the Foundation for the financial year 2014 was EUR 20 774 000,
representing an increase of 0.73 % compared to 2013.

·

Budget and financial management: Members note that the Foundations budget monitoring efforts during the financial year 2014
resulted in a budget implementation rate of 99.66 %. They also note that the level of committed appropriations carried over to 2015
was 53.7 % for operational expenditure and acknowledge that those carry-overs related mainly to multiannual projects.

Members also made a series of observations regarding commitments and carryovers, the prevention and management of conflicts of interest,
as well as on payments, contract award, recruitment and internal audit procedures.
Members note, in particular, that although the Foundation became operational in 1975, a comprehensive headquarters agreement between
the Foundation and the host Member State was not signed during 2014. They note with satisfaction that negotiations with the host Member
State, which started in February 2014, were completed and that the signing of the Foundations seat agreement took place on 10 November
2015.
Lastly, Members acknowledge that the Foundation remained an essential contributor to policy development, the use of its expertise in key
Union policy documents remained significant. They welcome the fact that the key performance indicators suggest a high visibility and
recognition of the scientific value of the Foundations research.
