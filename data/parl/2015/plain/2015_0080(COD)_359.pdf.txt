2015/0080(COD) - 14/04/2015 Legislative proposal

Summary

PURPOSE: to incorporate the anti-circumvention mechanism foreseen in the EU-Georgia Association Agreement into European Union law.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: the EU-Georgia Association Agreement was signed on 27 June 2014 and has been provisionally applied from 1 September
2014. The Agreement includes a so-called anti-circumvention mechanism, which provides for the possibility to reintroduce the most favoured
nation customs duty rate when imports of certain agricultural goods from Georgia exceed a given threshold without due justification of their
exact origin.
The Commission considered it necessary to lay down the procedures to guarantee the effective application of the anti-circumvention
mechanism for the temporary suspension of tariff preferences contained in the Agreement.
CONTENT: this proposed Regulation constitutes the legal instrument for the implementation of the anti-circumvention mechanism of the
Agreement already concluded with Georgia. It provides for the possibility to suspend the preferential customs duties for a maximum period of
six months when the imports of certain agricultural products and processed agricultural products reach the defined annual import volumes.
In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission.
In order to prevent a negative impact on the Union market as a result of an increase in imports, the Commission should adopt immediately
applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases relating to the temporary suspension of the preferential tariffs under the
anti-circumvention mechanism provided in the Agreement, imperative grounds of urgency so require.
For reasons of transparency, the Commission should submit an annual report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the
implementation of the Agreement and the application of the anti-circumvention mechanism.

2015/0080(COD) - 14/12/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on International Trade adopted the report by Gabrielius LANDSBERGIS (EPP, LT) on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council implementing the anti-circumvention mechanism providing for the temporary suspension of tariff
preferences of the Association Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community and their Member
States, of the one part, and Georgia, of the other part.
The committee recommended that the European Parliaments position, adopted at first reading under the ordinary legislative procedure, should
amend the Commission proposal so as to state that the report which is presented annually, shall, inter alia, include information about the
application of the anti-circumvention mechanism.

2015/0080(COD) - 03/02/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 623 votes to 9, with 60 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council implementing the anti-circumvention mechanism providing for the temporary suspension of tariff
preferences of the Association Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community and their Member
States, of the one part, and Georgia, of the other part.
Parliaments position, adopted at first reading under the ordinary legislative procedure, amended the Commission proposal so as to state that
the report which is presented annually on the application and implementation of this Regulation shall, inter alia, include information about the
application of the anti-circumvention mechanism.

2015/0080(COD) - 09/03/2016 Final act
PURPOSE: to implement the anti-circumvention mechanism provided for in the Association Agreement between the EU and Georgia.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Regulation (EU) 2016/401 of the European Parliament and of the Council implementing the anti-circumvention
mechanism provided for in the Association Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community and their
Member States, of the one part, and Georgia, of the other part.
CONTENT: the EU-Georgia Association Agreement was signed on 27 June 2014 and has been provisionally applied from 1 September 2014.
The Agreement includes an anti-circumvention mechanism, which provides for the possibility of reintroducing the most favoured nation
customs duty rate when imports of certain agricultural goods from Georgia exceed a given threshold without due justification of their exact
origin.
Objective: the Regulation lays down provisions for the implementation of the anti-circumvention mechanism provided for in the Agreement. It
applies to products originating in Georgia.
Anti-circumvention mechanism: the Regulation provides for the possibility of suspending the preferential customs duties for a maximum period
of six months when the imports of certain agricultural products and processed agricultural products reach the defined annual import volumes.
Implementation: implementing powers are conferred on the Commission in order to ensure uniform conditions for the application of the
anti-circumvention mechanism. In order to prevent a negative impact on the Union market as a result of an increase in imports, the
Commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases, imperative grounds of urgency so require.
Annual report: for reasons of transparency, the Commission will submit an annual report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the
implementation of the Agreement and the application of the anti-circumvention mechanism.

The European Parliament may, within 1 month of submission of the Commissions report, invite the Commission to an ad hoc meeting of its
responsible committee to present and explain any issues related to the implementation of the Regulation.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 24.3.2016.
