2015/2121(BUD) - 13/05/2015 Commission draft budget
PURPOSE: presentation of Draft Amending Budget No 5 to the 2015 budget to cover a reinforcement of the Union's resources to manage
migration and refugee flows.
CONTENT: Draft Amending Budget (DAB) No 5 for the year 2015 covers a reinforcement of the Union's resources to manage migration and
refugee flows, further to the recent developments in the Southern Mediterranean, in particular through additional appropriations for the
FRONTEX agency, the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) and the Internal Security Fund (ISF).
Taking into account the room for redeployment, including from the Galileo programme in payments, the total net increase of appropriations
requested for these purposes amounts to EUR 75.8 million in commitment appropriations and zero in payment appropriations.
Proposed measures: in the aftermath of a recent tragic event in the Mediterranean, which caused an estimated death toll of 700 persons, both
the Council and Parliament agreed that the European Union should take action.
These measures may be summarised as follows:
increase the EU contribution to FRONTEX in 2015 by an additional amount of EUR 26.8 million in both commitment and payment
appropriations. The aim is to triple the funding for the Joint Operations Triton and Poseidon over the final seven months of the year
2015 (Triton and Poseidon will be reinforced by intensifying aerial and maritime surveillance in an enlarged geographical area to

match the scope of Mare Nostrum in order to increase the search and rescue possibilities) ;
support the frontline Member States in receiving an increased number of migrants, the Commission proposes to reinforce the Asylum,
Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) and the Internal Security Fund (ISF): under the AMIF, an additional amount of EUR 57 million
in commitment appropriations and EUR 45.6 million; under the ISF, an additional amount of EUR 5 million in commitment
appropriations and EUR 4 million in payment appropriations is requested for 2015; the additional expenditure in 2015 for FRONTEX is
estimated at EUR 528 000, EUROPOL is estimated at EUR 99 000; the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) is estimated at EUR
132 000.
Proposed financing: overall, the total reinforcement in commitment appropriations to finance the measures outlined above amounts to EUR 89
million. As regards payment appropriations, an amount of EUR 76.6 million is required to cover the pre-financing (80%) of the additional
actions under AMIF and ISF and to allow FRONTEX to proceed with the co-financing of Triton.
The Commission carefully examined the possibilities of redeployment of appropriations within the 2015 budget, both for commitments and
payments. The Commission therefore proposes additional appropriations EUR 75.8 million in commitment appropriations and EUR 69.7
million in payment appropriations to provide the additional funding to be authorised in the 2015 budget for the migration measures.

2015/2121(BUD) - 19/06/2015 Council position on draft budget
On 13 May 2015, the Commission submitted to the Council draft amending budget (DAB) No 5 to the general budget for 2015.
The objective of this proposal is to reinforce the Union's resources to manage migration and refugee flows, further to the recent developments
in the Southern Mediterranean, in particular through additional appropriations for the FRONTEX Agency, the Asylum, Migration and Integration
Fund, and the Internal Security Fund.
An amount of EUR 75.8 million in commitment appropriations and EUR 69.6 million in payment appropriations is being proposed to finance the
additional needs for migration measures. Payment appropriations will be fully financed through redeployments from sub-heading 1a (Galileo).
On 19 June 2015, the Council adopted its position on DAB No 5/2015 as set out in the annex to the Council draft amending budget (DAB) No
5 to the general budget for 2015 (see technical annex Council document 9768/15).

2015/2121(BUD) - 25/06/2015 Budgetary report tabled for plenary, 1st reading
The Committee on Budgets adopted the report by Eider GARDIAZABAL RUBIAL (S&D, ES) on the Council position on Draft amending budget
No 5/2015 of the European Union for the financial year 2015 - Responding to migratory pressures.
To recall, draft amending budget No 5/2015 aims to reinforce the Union's resources to manage migration and refugee flows, following recent
tragedies in the Mediterranean and the increase in the dimension of migratory flows.
In this context, the increase in commitment appropriations amounts to EUR 75 722 000 and in payment appropriations amounting to EUR 69
652 000 is fully redeployed from the Galileo programme, leaving the overall level of payment appropriations in the 2015 budget unchanged.
The increase proposed for the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders (FRONTEX)
amounts to a total of EUR 26.8 million in both commitment and payment appropriations, partially stemming from additional appropriations
through Draft amending budget No 5/2015 and partially from redeployment within Chapter 18 02 (Internal Security) due to the closure of old
files under the External Borders Fund.
Draft amending budget No 5/2015 also increases the staffing level of 3 agencies, namely 16 additional posts for FRONTEX, 4 posts for the
European Asylum Support Office (EASO) and 3 posts for the European Police Office (Europol).
Whilst welcoming the willingness of all institutions to increase the budget appropriations related to migration and asylum, given the obvious
and urgent need, Members recalled that in its reading of the 2015 budget in October 2014, Parliament had already called for substantially
higher appropriations on these budget lines and additional staff for the agencies concerned.
Limited amounts: Members regretted the limited amount of the increases proposed in Draft amending budget No 5/2015 , which do not
correspond to the actual needs given the ongoing and probably worsening crisis in the Mediterranean, the growing risk of an increase in
refugees from Ukraine and the necessity to address migratory challenges in general.
They regretted the divisions which have emerged between Member States in the Council on the Commission proposal contained in the
"European Agenda on Migration". They recalled that, due to the nature of the migration phenomenon, the emergency can be more effectively
handled at Union level.
Moreover, Members stressed that, given the large number of arrivals on the Unions southern shores, the increasing role EASO has to play in
the management of asylum, and the clear call for support in frontloading reception conditions, the proposal to increase EASO staff by only 4 is
clearly insufficient. They therefore requested appropriate EASO staffing and budget for 2016 in order to allow EASO to effectively fulfil its tasks
and operations.
Better evaluation of the agencys needs: Members believe that the budgetary impact and the additional tasks of the measures presented as
part of the EU Agenda on Migration and the EU Agenda on Security with regard to Europol should be assessed in detail by the Commission to
allow the European Parliament and the Council to properly adjust Europols budgetary and staff needs. They stressed the need to ensure an
appropriate budget and level of staffing for Europol for 2016.
The Commission is called upon to carry out, in the context of the mid-term review of the Multiannual Financial Framework, an evaluation, as
precisely as possible, of the needs of the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund until 2020.
Members noted furthermore that Draft amending budget No 5/2015 does not foresee additional overall payment appropriations in the 2015
budget, but only reverts once more to the redeployment of already existing resources.

They insisted that the redeployment from Galileo needs to be duly compensated for in the 2016 budget whilst affirming the willingness to adopt
Draft amending budget No 5/2015 as soon as possible as presented by the Commission, given the urgency of the situation .
Lastly, Members called on the European Parliament to approve the Council position on Draft amending budget No 5/2015.

2015/2121(BUD) - 07/07/2015 Final act
PURPOSE: definitive adoption of Amending budget No 5/2015.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: definitive adoption (EU, Euratom) 2015/1769 of Amending budget No 5 of the European Union for the financial year 2015.
CONTENT: the European Parliament definitively adopted Amending budget 5/2015 of the European Union in accordance with its resolution of
7 July 2015 (please see the summary of the resolution).
This draft amending budget No 5/2015 aims to reinforce the Union's resources to manage migration and refugee flows, following recent
tragedies in the southern Mediterranean, particularly through increased appropriations for FRONTEX, the Asylum, Migration and Integration
Fund and funds for internal security.
The Amending budget increases
commitment appropriations amounting to EUR 75 722 000 and
payment appropriations amounting to EUR 69 652 000 that is fully redeployed from the Galileo programme, leaving the overall level of
payment appropriations in the 2015 budget unchanged.
The increase proposed for FRONTEX amounts to a total of EUR 26.8 million in both commitment and payment appropriations, partially
stemming from additional appropriations through amending budget No 5/2015 and partially from redeployment within Chapter 18 02 (Internal
Security) due to the closure of old files under the External Borders Fund.
The Amending budget No 5/2015 also increases the staffing level of 3 agencies, namely 16 additional posts for FRONTEX, 4 posts for the
European Asylum Support Office (EASO) and 3 posts for Europol.

2015/2121(BUD) - 07/07/2015 Budgetary text adopted by Parliament
The European Parliament adopted by 592 votes to 75, with 41 abstentions, a resolution on the Council position on Draft amending budget No
5/2015 of the European Union for the financial year 2015 - Responding to migratory pressures.
Draft amending budget No 5/2015 aims to reinforce the Union's resources to manage migration and refugee flows, following recent tragedies
in the Mediterranean and the increase in the dimension of migratory flows.
In this context, the increase in commitment appropriations amounts to EUR 75 722 000 and in payment appropriations amounting to EUR 69
652 000 is fully redeployed from the Galileo programme, leaving the overall level of payment appropriations in the 2015 budget unchanged.
The increase proposed for the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders (FRONTEX)
amounts to a total of EUR 26.8 million in both commitment and payment appropriations, partially stemming from additional appropriations

Draft amending budget No 5/2015 also increases the staffing level of 3 agencies, namely 16 additional posts for FRONTEX, 4 posts for the
European Asylum Support Office (EASO) and 3 posts for the European Police Office (Europol).
Whilst welcoming the willingness of all institutions to increase the budget appropriations related to migration and asylum, given the obvious
and urgent need, Parliament recalled that in its reading of the 2015 budget in October 2014, it had already called for substantially higher
appropriations on these budget lines and additional staff for the agencies concerned.
Limited amounts: Parliament regretted the limited amount of the increases proposed in Draft amending budget No 5/2015 , which do not
correspond to the actual needs given the ongoing and probably worsening crisis in the Mediterranean, the growing risk of an increase in
refugees from Ukraine and the necessity to address migratory challenges in general.
Recalling that the financial burden related to the emergency has so far fallen mainly on the national budgets of the southern coastal states of
the Union, Parliament regretted the divisions which have emerged between Member States in the Council on the Commission proposal
contained in the "European Agenda on Migration". It recalled that, due to the nature of the migration phenomenon, the emergency can be
more effectively handled at Union level.
Moreover, Parliament stressed that, given the large number of arrivals on the Unions southern shores, the increasing role EASO has to play in
the management of asylum, and the clear call for support in frontloading reception conditions, the proposal to increase EASO staff by only 4 is
clearly insufficient. Therefore, it requested appropriate EASO staffing and budget for 2016 in order to allow EASO to effectively fulfil its tasks
and operations.
Better evaluation of the agencys needs: Parliament stated that the budgetary impact and the additional tasks of the measures presented as
part of the EU Agenda on Migration and the EU Agenda on Security with regard to Europol should be assessed in detail by the Commission to
allow the European Parliament and the Council to properly adjust Europols budgetary and staff needs. It underlined the need to ensure an
appropriate budget and level of staffing for Europol for 2016.
The Commission is therefore called upon to carry out, in the context of the mid-term review of the Multiannual Financial Framework, an
evaluation, as precisely as possible, of the needs of the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund until 2020 including a sufficient increase in
appropriations.
Parliament noted furthermore that Draft amending budget No 5/2015 does not foresee additional overall payment appropriations in the 2015

budget, but only reverts once more to the redeployment of already existing resources. It insisted that the redeployment from Galileo needs to
be duly compensated for in the 2016 budget whilst affirming the willingness to adopt Draft amending budget No 5/2015 as soon as possible as
presented by the Commission, given the urgency of the situation.
Consequently, Parliament approved the Council position on Draft amending budget No 5/2015.
