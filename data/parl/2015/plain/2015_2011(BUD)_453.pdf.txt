2015/2011(BUD) - 13/01/2015 Commission draft budget
PURPOSE: presentation of draft amending budget No 1 to the general budget 2015.
CONTENT: on 26 November 2014, the Commission proposed "An Investment Plan for Europe" aiming at the mobilisation of at least EUR 315
billion in additional investment over the next three years. To this end, a new European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) will be set up in
partnership between the Commission and the European Investment Bank (EIB). EFSI will be supported by a guarantee of EUR 16 billion from
the EU budget, backed by a guarantee fund covering 50% of the EFSI outstanding liabilities.
The legislative proposal for the establishment of EFSI was adopted by the Commission on 13 January 2015. According to the conclusions of
the European Council held on 18 December 2014, the Union legislators are invited to agree on the proposals by June 2015, so that new
investment can be activated as early as mid-2015.
In accordance with the legislative proposal, Draft Amending Budget (DAB) No 1 for the year 2015 creates the budgetary structure for the
provisioning of the guarantee fund, and possible calls on the EU guarantee, as well as the budgeting of the appropriations for the provision of
advisory support for investment project identification, preparation and development.
Provisioning of the guarantee fund: the amount of the guarantee fund shall be gradually increased to reach the target amount of EUR 8 billion,
i.e. 50% of the total EU guarantee of EUR 16 billion. Payment appropriations from the general budget of the Union shall be phased in by 2020
following the indicative schedule provided in Annex I of the draft regulation establishing the Funds.
No payment appropriations are required for the budgetary year 2015.
The EUR 8 billion in commitment appropriations required for provisioning the guarantee fund will be financed as follows:
EUR 3.3 billion from the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF);
EUR 2.7+ billion from Horizon 2020 (H2020);
EUR 2 billion from unallocated margins under the expenditure ceilings of the multi-annual financial framework (MFF), including the
possible use of the Global Margin for Commitments.
It is also proposed for an amount of EUR 1 350 million in commitment appropriations is proposed to be redeployed to the new budget article
(01 04 05) to provision the EFSI guarantee fund for the year 2015 by:
reducing the CEF commitment appropriations by EUR 790 million (on the basis of the sector-specific multi-annual work programmes);
reducing the commitment appropriations of H2020 to EUR 70 million to take account of the consortia planning activities and the
proposals already prepared by the European research community for the year 2015;
reallocating EUR 490 million in 2015 from ITER (budget item 08 04 01 02).
In addition, for the year 2015, the Commission proposes to budget EUR 10 million in both commitment and payment appropriations on the new
budget article 01 04 06 as contribution from the general budget of the Union to the financing of the European Investment Advisory Hub (EIAH).
The European Investment Bank and the Commission estimate the level of the required annual contribution from the Union to the EIAH at EUR
20 million. Given the envisaged date of June 2015 for the adoption of the EFSI regulation, the Commission proposes to budget EUR 10 million
for 2015. The Commission proposes to offset these amounts through a corresponding reduction of the ITER budget item 08 04 01 02 in
commitments and payments.
Budgetary structure: the purpose of DAB No 1 is to propose the necessary changes to the budget nomenclature and to make the
corresponding reallocation of EUR 1 360 million in commitment appropriations and EUR 10 million in payment appropriations . The overall
impact in terms of expenditure or revenue is neutral for the 2015 budget.

2015/2011(BUD) - 26/06/2015 Council position on draft budget
On 15 January 2015, the Commission submitted draft amending budget (DAB) No 1/2015 accompanying the proposal for a Regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council on the European Fund for Strategic Investment (EFSI Regulation) and amending Regulations (EU) No
1291/2013 and (EU) No 1316/2013.
The aim of this DAB is to create a budgetary structure in the EU budget for the provisioning of the guarantee fund in 2015.
In terms of appropriations, DAB No 1/2015 proposes to redeploy EUR 1 360 million in commitment appropriations to the newly created
guarantee fund and to transfer EUR 10 million in payment appropriations for the financing of the European Investment Advisory Hub and the
European Investment Project Portal.
In order to enable the above-mentioned redeployments, the following reductions are proposed: EUR 790 million in commitment appropriations
from the Connecting Europe Facility, EUR 70 million in commitment appropriations from Horizon 2020 and EUR 500 million in commitments
from ITER. EUR 10 million in payment appropriations are redeployed from the ITER programme.
On 26 June 2015, the Council adopted its position on DAB No 1/2015 as set out in the annex to this draft amending budget (DAB) No 1/2015
(please see the technical annex to the Council document 9876/15).

2015/2011(BUD) - 30/06/2015 Budgetary report tabled for plenary, 1st reading
The Committee on Budgets adopted the report by Eider GARDIAZABAL RUBIAL (S&D, ES) on the Council position on Draft amending budget

No 1/2015 of the European Union for the financial year 2015, Section III Commission accompanying the proposal for a Regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council on the European Fund for Strategic Investments and amending Regulations (EU) No 1291/2013 and
(EU) No 1316/2013.
The committee recalled that Draft amending budget No 1/2015 aims to transpose the necessary changes to the budget nomenclature in line
with the legislative agreement on the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) and to provide for the necessary reallocation of EUR 1
360 million in commitment appropriations and EUR 10 million in payment appropriations.
For the provisioning of the guarantee fund in 2015 a total amount of EUR 1 350 million is being redeployed from the Connecting Europe
Facility (EUR 790 million), Horizon 2020 (EUR 70 million) and ITER (EUR 490 million) in commitment appropriations. The Commission intends
to offset the reduction for ITER by an equivalent increase over the period 2018-2020.
The provisioning in commitment and payment appropriations of the European Investment Advisory Hub, amounting to EUR 10 million each, is
fully redeployed from ITER (budget article 08 04 01 02).
Members stressed that all additional appropriations to implement the EFSI in commitments and payments are fully redeployed, thus leaving
the overall commitment and payment appropriations in the 2015 budget unchanged.
Following the budgetary negotiations: in general, Members welcomed the dedication of all institutions to find an agreement on the EFSI in due
time to allow for its launch as quickly as possible. Members stated that the outcome of the negotiations is better than the original Commission
proposal.
They reiterated the role of the Union budget in creating added value by pooling resources and ensuring a high degree of synergies between
the European Structural and Investment Funds and EFSI.
They welcomed the fact that an additional EUR 1 billion compared to the initial Commission proposal will be financed through the Global MFF
margin for commitments, stemming from margins left available in the 2014 and 2015 budgets, thus reducing the redeployment from CEF and
Horizon 2020. They regretted, however, in general the redeployment from CEF and Horizon 2020 as they are essential programmes for jobs
and growths in Europe. They called on the Parliament to remedy these redeployments in the upcoming annual budgetary procedures.
At the same time, Members affirmed Parliaments willingness to adopt Draft amending budget No 1/2015 as modified by the Council in line with
the legislative agreement on the EFSI, given its interest to launch the EFSI as quickly as possible.
