2015/2166(DEC) - 23/07/2015 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: presentation by the Commission of the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2014, as part of
the 2014 discharge procedure.
Analysis of the accounts of the European Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA).
CONTENT: this Commission document sets out the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2014 as
prepared on the basis of the information presented by the institutions, organisations and bodies of the EU, in accordance with Article 148(2) of
the Financial Regulation applicable to the EU's General Budget, including the European Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA).
The document contains the figures on which the discharge procedure is based.
On this basis, the Financial Controller of the European Commission ensures the certification of the consolidated accounts as declared by the
institutions, agencies and bodies of the European Union.
Discharge procedure of the EU agencies: the EU Budget finances a wide range of policies and programmes throughout the EU. In accordance
with the priorities set by the European Parliament and the Council in the multi-annual financial framework (MFF), the European Commission
carries out specific programmes, activities and projects in the field with the technical support of some specialised agencies.
The consolidated annual accounts of the EU provide information on the activities of the institutions, agencies and other bodies of the EU from
a budgetary and accrual accounting perspective.
The consolidated reports on the implementation of the general budget of the EU include the budget implementation of all Institutions. Agencies
do not have a separate budget inside the EU budget; and they are partially financed by a Commission budget subsidy.

This document sets out how the Agencies spent and implemented their budget in 2014. Each agency is subject to its own discharge
procedure.
FRA: in 2014, the tasks and budget of this agency were as follows:
description of FRA's tasks: the Agency, which is located in Vienna, was established by Council Regulation (EC) No 168/2007. Its main
objective is to provide the relevant authorities of the Union and its Member States with assistance and expertise when implementing
Union law relating to fundamental rights. The Agencys task is to collect information as well as providing expert advice to the
institutions on a range of issues.
FRA's budget for the 2014 financial year: the Agencys budget for 2014, as presented in the Commission document on the
consolidated annual accounts of the European Union, gives the following figures:
Commitment appropriations :
- committed : EUR 22 million;
- paid : EUR 22 million;
- carried-over : 0.
Payment appropriations :
- committed : EUR 28 million;
- paid : EUR 21 million;
- carried-over : EUR 7 million.
Please refer also to the final accounts of the FRA.

2015/2166(DEC) - 08/09/2015 Court of Auditors: opinion, report
PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the European Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) for the
financial year 2014, together with the Agencys reply.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit concerned, amongst others, the annual accounts of the European Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA).
Statement of assurance: pursuant to the provisions of Article 287 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the Court
has audited:
the annual accounts of the Agency, which comprise the financial statements and the reports on the implementation of the budget for
the financial year ended 31 December 2014; and
the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying those accounts.
Opinion on the reliability of the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the Agencys annual accounts present fairly, in all material respects, its
financial position as at 31 December 2014 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the
provisions of its Financial Regulation and the accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
Opinion on the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the transactions underlying the annual
accounts for the year ended 31 December 2014 are legal and regular in all material respects.
The report also makes a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of the Agency, accompanied by the latters
response. The main observations may be summarised as follows:
The Courts observations:
budgetary management: the Court noted that the 2014 budget appropriations were fully committed. However, the level of committed
appropriations carried over to 2015 was high at 25% for administrative expenditure and 75% for operating expenditure. The
carry-overs mainly reflect the multiannual nature of the Agencys operational projects, where payments are made according to planned
schedules;
remuneration of officials: in 2005 new EU Staff Regulations entered into force, including provisions that future remuneration of officials
recruited before 1 May 2004 should not be less than under the previous EU Staff Regulations. The Courts audit revealed that this was
not complied with and, in the case of 10 of the 26 officials employed at that time, this led to a total underpayment of EUR 45 892 for
the period 2005 to 2014.
The Agencys replies:
budgetary management: the Agency acknowledged the understanding from the Court on the well-monitored and justified carry-overs;
remuneration of officials: the Agency has taken the necessary corrective measures and executed the supplementary salary payments.
Lastly, the Court of Auditors report contains a summary of the Agencys activities in 2014. This is focused on the following:
Budget: EUR 21.52 million of which the Union subsidy amounts to 99%.
Activities:
a number of contributions in the framework of FRANET (such as comparative analyses with the participation of 28 contractors);

publication of research reports and annual reports;
key conferences and events;
cooperation with institutions and bodies at EU and Member State level.

2015/2166(DEC) - 27/01/2016 Supplementary non-legislative basic document
Having examined the revenue and expenditure accounts for the financial year 2014 and the balance sheet as at 31 December 2014 of the
European Union Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA), as well as the Court of Auditors' report on the annual accounts of the Agency for the
financial year 2014, accompanied by the Agency's replies to the Court's observations, the Council recommended the European Parliament to
give a discharge to the Director of the Agency in respect of the implementation of the budget for the financial year 2014.
The Council welcomed the Court's opinion that, in all material respects, the Agency's annual accounts fairly present its financial position as at
31 December 2014 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions of the
Agency's Financial Regulation, and that the underlying transactions for 2014 are legal and regular in all material respects.
Nevertheless, the Council has made some observations which may be summarised as follows:
financial programming: while acknowledging the multiannual nature of many of the Agency's projects, in particular as regards IT
projects, the Council noted that a high level of commitment appropriations was carried over to 2015. It encouraged the Agency to
continue improving its financial programming and monitoring of the budget implementation, in order to reduce the level of
commitments carried over to the following financial year to the strict minimum, in line with the budgetary principle of annuality;
staff remunerations: lastly, the Council noted the Courts observation that the Agency did not comply with certain of the Staff
Regulations' provisions on remuneration and welcomed the corrective measures taken by the Agency to address these shortcomings.

2015/2166(DEC) - 08/04/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Derek VAUGHAN (S&D, UK) on discharge in respect of the implementation of the
budget of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights for the financial year 2014.
The parliamentary committee calls on the European Parliament to grant the Director of the Agency discharge in respect of the implementation
of the Agencys budget for the financial year 2014.
Noting that the Court of Auditors issued a statement of assurance as to the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the
underlying transactions for the financial year 2014, Members call on Parliament to approve the closure of the Agencys accounts. They made,
however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is granted, in addition to the general
recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies:
Agencys financial statements: Members note that the final budget of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights for the
financial year 2014 was EUR 21 229 000, representing a decrease of 0.56 % compared to 2013. 99 % of the budget of the Agency
derives from the Union budget.
Budget and financial management: Members note that budget monitoring efforts during the financial year 2014 resulted in a budget
implementation rate of 100 %. However, committed appropriations carried over to 2015 were at 25 % administrative expenditure and
at 75 % for operating expenditure.
Members also made a series of observations regarding commitments and carryovers, preventing and managing conflicts of interest, as well as
on contract award, recruitment and internal audit procedures.
Members ascertain that an independent evaluation of the Agency was undertaken in 2012 to evaluate the effectiveness, efficiency, added
value, utility, coordination and coherence of the Agencys work. They note that one of key priorities included in the Agencys Strategic plan
2013-2017 is to help enhance the Agencys contribution to processes at national level. They also note that in February 2014 the Agency
launched a webpage for children as part of its website section on the rights of the child where children can find information on what their rights
are, who decides on their rights, what the Agency does for children and links if they want to know more.
Lastly, Members call for an overall improvement in the prevention of, and the fight against, corruption through a holistic approach, commencing
with better public access to documents and more stringent rules on conflicts of interest .

2015/2166(DEC) - 28/04/2016 Final act
PURPOSE: to grant discharge to the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) for the financial year 2014.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision (EU) 2016/1573 of the European Parliament on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of
the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights for the financial year 2014.
CONTENT: with the present decision, the European Parliament grants discharge to the Director of the European Union Agency for
Fundamental Rights for the implementation of its budget for the financial year 2014.
This decision is in line with the European Parliament's resolution adopted on 28 April 2016 and comprises a series of observations that form
an integral part of the discharge decision (please refer to the summary of the opinion of 28 April 2016).
Amongst Parliaments main observations in the resolution accompanying the discharge decision, the latter acknowledged that the Agency
adopted guidelines for the prevention of conflicts of interest for its staff and that it applies the Commissions whistle-blowing guidelines. It also
noted that its staff members are obliged to report facts pointing to possible illegal activity, including fraud or corruption, or to a serious failure to
comply with their professional obligations.
