OJ L 178 02.07.2016, p. 0018 Summary

2015/0309(CNS) - 18/12/2015 Initial legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to subject ?-PVP to control measures and criminal penalties as provided under their legislation by virtue of their obligations under
the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to
follow its opinion.
BACKGROUND: the risks of ?-PVP were assessed by the Scientific Committee of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug
Addition (EMCDDA), acting in compliance with the provisions of Council Decision 2005/387/JHA. In particular, the Council requested an
assessment of the risks caused by the use, manufacture and trafficking of the new psychoactive substance ?-PVP. The Chair of the Scientific
Committee submitted the risk assessment report to the Commission and to the Council on 27 November 2015.
?-PVP is a potent psychostimulant. The substance detected in all 28 Member States as well as in Turkey and Norway, is mainly imported into
the EU drug market from China and then distributed across Europe.
There have been a total of 115 deaths and 191 acute intoxications registered in eight Member States reported where ?-PVP was detected.
There is no available information or published studies assessing in a comprehensive way the health risks associated with ?-PVP, namely
chronic and acute toxicity, but observations in animals suggest similar effects with those observed with other stimulants.
According to the risk assessment report, the acute toxicity of ?-PVP is such that it can cause severe harms to the health of individuals.
Therefore, the Commission considered that there are grounds for subjecting this substance to control measures across the Union.
CONTENT: the objective of this proposal for a Council Decision is to call upon the Member States to subject ?-PVP to control measures and
criminal penalties as provided under their legislation by virtue of their obligations under the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic
Substances.
Currently, sixteen Member States control ?-PVP under national legislation complying with the obligations of the 1971 United Nations
Convention on Psychotropic Substances and five Member States use other legislative measures to control it. Subjecting this substance to

control measures across the Union would help avoid the emergence of obstacles in cross-border law enforcement and judicial cooperation,
and would help protect from the risks that its availability and use can pose.

2015/0309(CNS) - 21/12/2015 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to subject the new psychoactive substance 1-phenyl-2-(1-pyrrolidin-1-yl) pentan-1one (?-pyrrolidinovalerophenone, ?-PVP) to
control measures.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to
follow its opinion.
BACKGROUND: a risk assessment report on the new psychoactive substance ?-PVP was drawn up in compliance with Decision
2005/387/JHA by a special session of the extended Scientific Committee of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction,
and was subsequently submitted to the Commission and to the Council on 27 November 2015.
?-PVP is a potent psychostimulant, structurally related to cathinone, pyrovalerone and Methylendioxypyrovaleron (MDPV) which are controlled
under the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances.
There have been a total of 115 deaths and 191 acute intoxications registered in eight Member States reported where ?-PVP was detected.
?-PVP has no established or acknowledged medical use (human or veterinary).
Despite the limited scientific evidence available on ?-PVP, the evidence and information on the health risks that the substance poses, as
documented in its detection in fatalities and acute intoxications, provides sufficient ground for subjecting ?-PVP to control measures across the
Union.
CONTENT: the proposed Decision seeks to subject the new psychoactive substance 1-phenyl-2-(1-pyrrolidin-1-yl) pentan-1one (?
-pyrrolidinovalerophenone, ?-PVP) to control measures across the Union.
Since sixteen Member States control ?-PVP under national legislation complying with the obligations of the 1971 United Nations Convention
on Psychotropic Substances and five Member States use other legislative measures to control it, subjecting this substance to control
measures across the Union would help avoid the emergence of obstacles in cross-border law enforcement and judicial cooperation, and would
help protect from the risks that its availability and use can pose.
For further details, please report to the summary of the Commissions initial legislative proposal of 18.12.2015.

2015/0309(CNS) - 10/05/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs adopted, in the framework of a special legislative procedure (Parliaments
consultation), the report by Micha? BONI (EPP, PL) on the draft Council decision on subjecting the new psychoactive substance
1phenyl-2-(1-pyrrolidin-1-yl) pentan-1-one (?-pyrrolidinovalerophenone, ?PVP) to control measures.
The committee approved the draft Council decision without amendments.
To recall, the proposed Decision seeks to subject the new psychoactive substance, ?-PVP, a potent psychostimulant, to control measures
across the Union.

2015/0309(CNS) - 08/06/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 646 votes to 7, with 21 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the draft Council decision on subjecting
the new psychoactive substance 1-phenyl-2-(1-pyrrolidin-1-yl) pentan-1-one (?-pyrrolidinovalerophenone, ?-PVP) to control measures.
In line with the recommendation made by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, Parliament approved the draft Council
decision which aims to subject the new psychoactive substance, ?-PVP, a potent psychostimulant, to control measures across the Union.

2015/0309(CNS) - 27/06/2016 Final act
PURPOSE: to subject the new psychoactive substance 1-phenyl-2-(1-pyrrolidin-1-yl) pentan-1one (?-pyrrolidinovalerophenone, ?-PVP) to
control measures.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2016/1070 on subjecting 1-phenyl-2-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)pentan-1-one
(?-pyrrolidinovalerophenone, ?-PVP) to control measures.
CONTENT: the Council adopted an implementing decision on subjecting the new psychoactive substance 1-phenyl-2-(1-pyrrolidin-1-yl)
pentan-1one (?-pyrrolidinovalerophenone, ?-PVP) to control measures across the Union.
?-PVP is a potent psychostimulant, structurally related to cathinone, pyrovalerone and methylendioxypyrovaleron (MDPV), which are
controlled under the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances.
The implementing Decision implements Decision 2005/387/JHA that confers upon the Council implementing powers with a view to giving a
quick and expertise-based response at Union level to the emergence of new psychoactive substances detected and reported by the Member

States, by subjecting those substances to control measures across the Union.
A risk assessment report on the new psychoactive substance ?-PVP was drawn up in accordance with Decision 2005/387/JHA by a special
session of the extended Scientific Committee of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA).
There is no available information or any published study assessing in a comprehensive way the health risks associated with ?-PVP, namely
chronic and acute toxicity, but observations in animals suggest similar effects to those observed in other stimulants.
Despite the limited scientific evidence available on ?-PVP, the evidence and information on the health risks that the substance poses, as
documented in its detection in fatalities and acute intoxications, provides sufficient grounds for subjecting ?-PVP to control measures across
the Union.
By 3 July 2017, Member States shall take the necessary measures, in accordance with their national law, to subject the new psychoactive
substance to control measures and criminal penalties, as provided for under their legislation, complying with their obligations under the 1971
United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances.
The United Kingdom is not bound by Decision 2005/387/JHA and is therefore not taking part in the adoption of this Decision, which
implements Decision 2005/387/JHA, and is not bound by it or subject to its application.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 3.8.2016.
