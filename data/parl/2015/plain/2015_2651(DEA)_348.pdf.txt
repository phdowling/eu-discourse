Summary

The European Parliament adopted by 618 votes to 33 with 28 abstentions a resolution objecting to the Commission delegated directive of 30
January 2015 amending, for the purposes of adapting to technical progress, Annex III to Directive 2011/65/EU of the European Parliament and
of the Council as regards an exemption for cadmium in illumination and display lighting applications.
Delegated directive: Directive 2011/65/EU on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment
restricts inter alia the use of cadmium in electrical and electronic equipment.
Pursuant to Article 5(1) a, exemptions would be included in Annex III, provided that such inclusion did not weaken the environmental and
health protection afforded by Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 (REACH) and where any of the following conditions was fulfilled:
their elimination or substitution via design changes or materials and components which did not require any of the materials or
substances listed in Annex II was scientifically or technically impracticable;
the reliability of substitutes was not ensured; or the total negative environmental, health and consumer safety impacts caused by
substitution were likely to outweigh the total environmental, health and consumer safety benefits.
The Commission delegated directive:
extended exemption 39 until 30 June 2017, relabelling it exemption 39(a), and
introduced a new more specific exemption 39(b) on Cadmium in downshifting cadmium based semiconductor nanocrystal quantum
dots for use in display lighting applications (&lt; 0.2 Âµg Cd per mm2 of display screen area), with an expiry date of 30 June 2018.
The extension of exemption 39 and the new exemption 39(b) both concerned cadmium quantum dots, even though a specific reference to
quantum dots is given only in exemption 39(b). The extension of exemption 39 concerned two different applications of cadmium quantum dots:
one concerned the use in solid state illumination, while the other concerned display systems. The new exemption 39(b) only concerned
displays.
Parliaments objection: Parliament objected to the delegated directive because it considered that the directive failed to comply with the
conditions laid down in Article 5(1)(a) of Directive 2011/65/EU, for both exemptions it inserted in points 39(a) and 39(b) of Annex III to Directive
2011/65/EU.
It felt in particular that the justification given for the exemption in point 39(b) was based on an outdated situation with regard to the practicability
of replacement of cadmium in quantum dots. It therefore called for a swift reassessment of the existing exemption in point 39 of Annex III to
Directive 2011/65/EU against the conditions of Article 5(1)(a) with a view to its revocation.
The Commission was asked to submit a new delegated act which took into account the position of Parliament.
