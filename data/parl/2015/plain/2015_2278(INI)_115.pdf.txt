2015/2278(INI) - 28/04/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Regional Development adopted the own-initiative report by Ramón Luis VALCÁRCEL SISO (EPP, ES) on Cohesion Policy
and Research and Innovation Strategies for Smart Specialisation (RIS3).
Members recalled that during the last legislative period, the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) in support of Thematic Objective
No 1, established that regions were required to focus their investment on R&D&I via smart specialisation strategies in the 2014-2020
programming period. Therefore, RIS3 is an ex-ante condition for member states and EU regions for receiving European Structural and
Investment Funds (ESIF).
Smart specialisation combines and brings together different policies, including those for entrepreneurship, education and innovation, in order
for regions to identify and select priority areas for their development and related investments by focusing on their strengths and comparative
advantages.
The central role of RIS3: Members underlined that smart specialisation strategies support thematic concentration and strategic programming of
the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESI Funds) and lead to increased performance orientation on the ground, thus contributing to
the achievement of the Europe 2020 objectives. They called on all actors involved to:
develop RIS3 on the basis of analyses of each regions existing capabilities, assets and competences;
focus on entrepreneurial discovery in order to detect emerging niches or comparative advantages for smart specialisation, avoid
forced and artificial overspecialisation;
enhance a stronger partnership between public and private sectors while always avoiding possible conflicts of interest between the
private and public sectors.
Members supported a broad definition of innovation as signifying the transformation of an idea into a new or improved product or service
introduced on the market, into a new or improved operational process used in industry and commerce, or into a new approach to a social
service.
They asked for:
regions to design schemes for innovative support services aimed at complementing or replacing existing support services, in order to
allow a given region to achieve its full competitive potential, help enterprises absorb new knowledge and technology in order to remain
competitive;
the Commission to align the general block exemption regulation in order to allow the Seal of Excellence conditions to be offered by the
ESI Funds;
national authorities to invest in regional intelligence and big data mining so that they are enabled both to demonstrate their unique
competitive advantage and to understand trends relating to regional enterprises in the global value chain.
Welcoming the role of the Smart Specialisation Platform (S3 platform) established by the Commissions DG REGIO and located at the JRC in
Seville, the report stressed that this platform should: (i) play a key role in advising regions and setting benchmarks on their innovation
strategies; (ii) help lagging regions and enhancing multilevel governance and synergies between regions.
Multi-level governance and its capacity: Members regretted that some Member States have decided to opt for national RIS3 without giving

local and regional authorities a chance to develop their own views. They called on the Member States concerned to reconsider replacing the
national RIS3 by regional ones in order not to miss out on growth opportunities , and called for a better coordination between national and
regional S3 strategies wherever appropriate, in order to adapt them if necessary to future needs and requirements for sustainable
development, in particular in the food and energy sectors.
In order to encourage a change of mentality and to promote innovative policy approaches to boost intra-regional, inter-regional, extra-regional,
cross-border and transnational collaboration, the report called for:
the development of flexibility and coordination mechanisms to link the results of the RIS3 process to the implementation of Horizon
2020 and other programmes;
the encouragement of regions to engage in forms of transnational cooperation such as the Vanguard Initiative, the Seal of Excellence,
the Knowledge Exchange Platform (KEP), the S3 platforms, the Stairway to Excellence, and the regional innovation schemes for the
co-location centres of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT);
the facilitation of the development of strategic cluster partnerships, with a view to boosting investment, enhancing coordination,
creating synergies and promoting exchanges of views in order to avoid duplication and inefficient spending of public resources.
Better synergies for growth and job creation: Members criticised the lack of synergies across ESI Funds and other EU financing instruments,
which hinders coordination, coherence and integration in EU funding, as well as reducing its results and impact. They called for action to
obtain the necessary information for achieving synergies between the various policies and instruments available in the RIS3, such as the
cohesion policy for 2014-2020, the smart specialisation platform, the European Cluster Observatory, the European Innovation Partnership, the
European Strategy Forum, the Key Enabling Technologies (KETs) and the research infrastructures.
The report stressed the need for the further development and extension throughout Europe of the concept of 'smart and connected cities'. It
welcomed the intention of the Dutch EU Presidency to create a bottom-up approach empowering cities in coordination with regional
authorities, to develop the EU Urban Agenda.
Monitoring and evaluation: although most regions have adopted a RIS3, a considerable number of them still need to work on complying with
the ex-ante conditionality requirements, the main challenges being the monitoring mechanism, the budgetary framework and the measures to
stimulate private-sector research and innovation investments.
Members regretted a lack of granularity in many of the strategies, and called for the refinement of the prioritisation process, thus avoiding the
risk of focusing all strategies on the same topics. They called for the development of strategies not only in high technology but also in low
technology and social innovation.
The EU and the Member States are called upon to carry out periodic (annual and mid-term) monitoring both quantitative and qualitative of the
implementation of the strategies, and to involve all stakeholders, including civil society, in the process.
Main lessons: Members called on the Commission to push for a review of the strategies in 2017 in order to boost their efficiency and
effectiveness, and to provide information on their contribution to both future cohesion and research and innovation policies after 2020. They
asked DG REGIO and the S3 platform to draft, and widely disseminate, a short policy paper on the past RIS3 experience.

2015/2278(INI) - 13/09/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 570 votes to 54 with 15 abstentions, a resolution on cohesion policy and research and innovation
strategies for smart specialisation (RIS3).
Members recalled that strengthening research, technological development and innovation is one of the investment priorities under the
European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) for 2014-2020. For the 2014-2020 programming period, Member States are required to
develop national and/or regional smart specialisation strategies by involving national and regional managing authorities and stakeholders.
Smart specialisation combines and brings together different policies, including those for entrepreneurship, education and innovation, in order
for regions to identify and select priority areas for their development and related investments by focusing on their strengths and comparative
advantages.
The central role of RIS3: Parliament underlined that smart specialisation strategies support thematic concentration and strategic programming
of the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESI Funds) and lead to increased performance orientation on the ground, thus contributing
to the achievement of the Europe 2020 objectives. It called on all actors involved to:

the facilitation of the development of strategic cluster partnerships, with a view to boosting investment, enhancing coordination,
creating synergies and promoting exchanges of views in order to avoid duplication and inefficient spending of public resources.
Better synergies for growth and job creation: Parliament underlined that the coordinated and complementary use of ESI Funds together with
Horizon 2020 and EFSI funds provides excellent options for boosting innovation at regional, national and EU levels by enhancing the
attractiveness of investment in research and innovation in order to attract private capital to complement public funding. It called for increased
support for SMEs and start-ups, as the vast majority of these are at the forefront of disruptive innovation.
Smart cities as catalysts for RIS3: the resolution stressed the need for the further development and extension throughout Europe of the
concept of 'smart and connected cities'. It welcomed the intention of the Dutch EU Presidency to create a bottom-up approach empowering
cities in coordination with regional authorities, to develop the EU Urban Agenda.
Monitoring and evaluation: Members regretted a lack of granularity in many of the strategies, and called for the refinement of the prioritisation
