OJ L 200 26.07.2016, p. 0137 Summary

2015/0906(COD) - 17/11/2015 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: transfer to the General Court of the European Union of jurisdiction, at first instance, in disputes between the Union and its
servants.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: Article 48 of Protocol No 3 on the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, as amended by a Regulation (EU,
Euratom) of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Protocol No 3 on the Statute of the Court of Justice, provides that the
General Court, consisting of 40 Judges as from the date of entry into force of the amending Regulation, will consist of 47 Judges as from 1
September 2016, and of two Judges per Member State as from 1 September 2019.
Increasing by seven the number of Judges of the General Court on 1 September 2016 will also require jurisdiction at first instance in disputes
between the Union and its servants to be transferred to the General Court, which presupposes, the dissolution of the European Union Civil
Service Tribunal (CST).
CONTENT: the draft Regulation of the Parliament and of the Council set out below is based on Article 256(1) TFEU, the first and second
paragraphs of Article 257 TFEU, the second paragraph of Article 281 TFEU, and Article 106a(1) EAEC.
The proposed text:
1) repeals Council Decision 2004/752/EC, Euratom establishing the European Union Civil Service Tribunal and, in consequence thereof,
Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 979/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council relating to temporary Judges of the European Union
Civil Service Tribunal;
2) introduces two new Articles into the Statute of the Court seeking to:
set out that the General Court shall exercise at first instance jurisdiction in disputes between the Union and its servants , including
disputes between all institutions and all bodies, offices or agencies, on the one hand, and their servants, on the other, in respect of
which jurisdiction is conferred on the Court of Justice of the European Union;
enable the court responsible for civil service disputes to examine, at all stages of the procedure, the possibilities of amicable
settlement of disputes.
A new Article provides, in general terms, that the provisions relating to the jurisdiction, composition, organisation and procedure of any
specialised court established under Article 257 TFEU are to be contained in an Annex to the Statute.
3) governs the procedure for dealing with cases pending before the Civil Service Tribunal (CST) on 31 August 2016, which are to be
transferred, on 1 September 2016, to the General Court. The General Court should continue dealing with those cases as it finds them at that
date, the procedural steps taken by the CST in those cases remaining applicable. In the event of a case being transferred to the General Court
after the hearing, the oral part of the procedure would be reopened;
4) lays down a transitional regime in respect of appeals under examination when jurisdiction is transferred on 1 September 2016, or brought
after that date, against decisions of the CST. The General Court is to continue to have jurisdiction to hear and determine such appeals.
Accordingly, Articles 9 to 12 of Annex I to the Statute of the Court must remain applicable to the proceedings concerned. If the General Court
sets aside a decision of the CST but considers that the state of the proceedings does not permit a decision, it is to refer the case to a chamber
other than that which ruled on the appeal (that is to say, the Appeal Chamber).
Lastly, the proposal sets the date on which the transfer of jurisdiction to the General Court to rule at first instance on disputes between the
Union and its servants is to take effect as 1 September 2016.

2015/0906(COD) - 02/05/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Legal Affairs adopted the report by Mady DELVAUX (S&D, LU) on the draft regulation of the European Parliament and of
the Council on the transfer to the General Court of the European Union of jurisdiction at first instance in disputes between the Union and its
servants.
The committee recommended that the European Parliaments position adopted at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure
should amend the Court of Justices draft:
Legal basis: the draft by the Court of Justice refers to the Treaty on European Union, and in particular the second subparagraph of Article
19(2) thereof. However, Members considered that Article 19(2) TEU is not an appropriate legal basis for this regulation, as no change is made
to the number of judges at the General Court. They stated that the proper legal basis is to be found in Articles 256(1), 257 and 281 TFEU
together with Article 106a of the Euratom Treaty.
Title relating to specialised courts: Members proposed deleting Title Iva. They stated that there was no need to replace Article 62c with a
generic reference to specialised courts and to a non-existent annex. They believe that the entire title on specialised courts, which contains only
this article, can be repealed. It could, of course, be recreated in the future if and when a specialised court is established, as was the case in

2004.
Annex I: Members considered it preferable to repeal Annex I explicitly in the article concerning modifications to the Protocol.

2015/0906(COD) - 09/06/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 456 votes to 99, with 61 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the draft regulation of the European
Parliament and of the Council on the transfer to the General Court of the European Union of jurisdiction at first instance in disputes between
the Union and its servants.
The European Parliaments position, adopted at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure, amended the Court of Justices draft
as follows:
the correct legal basis shall be Article 256(1), the first and second paragraphs of Article 257, and the second paragraph of Article 281
of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and Article 106a(1) of the Treaty establishing the European Atomic
Energy Community;
Council Decision 2004/752/EC, Euratom and Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 979/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council
shall be repealed and Protocol No 3 shall be amended;
the increase of 7 Judges of the General Court (40 to 47) as from 1 September 2016 should be accompanied by the transfer to the
General Court of jurisdiction at first instance in disputes between the Union and its servants under Article 270 of the Treaty on the
Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). This transfer of jurisdiction presupposes, in accordance with Article 256(1) TFEU, the
dissolution of the European Union Civil Service Tribunal ("Civil Service Tribunal");
the General Court should try European Union civil service cases taking into account the specific features of disputes in that field,
including by examining the possibilities for amicable settlement at all stages of the procedure;
appropriate transitional arrangements concerning the transfer to the General Court of European Union civil service cases;
the Regulation shall enter into force on the first day of the month following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European
Union. It shall apply from 1 September 2016.

2015/0906(COD) - 06/07/2016 Final act
PURPOSE: transfer to the General Court of the European Union of jurisdiction, at first instance, in disputes between the Union and its
servants.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2016/1192 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the transfer to the General Court
of jurisdiction at first instance in disputes between the European Union and its servants.
CONTENT: the Regulation sets the date on which the transfer of jurisdiction to the General Court to rule at first instance on disputes between
the Union and its servants is to take effect as 1 September 2016.
The General Court should try European Union civil service cases taking into account the specific features of disputes in that field, including by
examining the possibilities for amicable settlement at all stages of the procedure.
In order to ensure the efficient conduct of proceedings in the cases pending before the Civil Service Tribunal on the date of transfer, and to lay
down the rules applicable to appeals under examination as at that date, or brought subsequently, against decisions of that Tribunal, the
Regulation lays down provisions for appropriate transitional arrangements concerning the transfer to the General Court of European Union civil
service cases.
Council Decision 2004/752/EC, Euratom establishing the European Union Civil Service Tribunal and Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 979/2012 of
the European Parliament and of the Council relating to temporary Judges of the European Union Civil Service Tribunal shall be repealed.
