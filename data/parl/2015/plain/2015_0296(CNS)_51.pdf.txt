Directive 2016/856
OJ L 142 31.05.2016, p. 0012 Summary

2015/0296(CNS) - 14/12/2015 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to extend, for a period of two years, the current situation where the minimum standard rate of VAT in Member States is at 15%.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Directive.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to
follow its opinion.
BACKGROUND: Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax ("the VAT Directive") provides that from 1 January 2011
until 31 December 2015 the standard rate may not be less than 15%. This current minimum standard rate provision has been extended five
times.
The Commission considers that the standard rate of value added tax (VAT) currently in force in Member States, combined with the mechanism
of the transitional system has ensured that this system has functioned to an acceptable degree. With new rules on the place of supply of
services which favour taxation at the place of consumption, the possibilities for exploiting differences in VAT rates through relocation have
been limited further and potential distortions of competition reduced.

In the light of results obtained following its Communication of 2011 on the future of VAT, the Commission will publish an Action Plan for a
definitive system of Value Added Tax for intra-EU trade that the Commission wants to propose and the reforms it envisages to adapt the
existing rules on VAT rates to a definitive regime characterised by the destination principle. This review of rules on VAT rates will address two
key issues:
the possibility of giving greater autonomy in rate-setting ('enhanced flexibility') to Member States, and
the manner of dealing with the temporary derogations allowing for exemptions, zero rates and super reduced rates, that would have to
be reconsidered upon the introduction of the definitive VAT regime.
CONTENT: pending the decisions on the final shape of the definitive regime, the Commission proposes to amend the VAT Directive in order to
extend from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2017 the period of application of the current minimum standard rate of VAT in Member States,
set at 15%.
This sixth prolongation maintains the current satisfactory situation and provides legal certainty for stakeholders, while allowing the definitive
VAT regime for intra-EU trade to enter into force on the basis of a reviewed set of rules for standard and reduced VAT rates.
The proposed measure does not preclude a further revision of VAT legislation before 31 December 2017 to address the final arrangement of a
definitive VAT regime for intra-Union trade.

2015/0296(CNS) - 18/03/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs adopted, in the framework of a special legislative procedure (Parliaments consultation), the
report by Peter SIMON (S&D, DE) on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value
added tax, with regard to the duration of the obligation to respect a minimum standard rate.
The VAT Directive provides that from 1 January 2011 until 31 December 2015, the standard rate may not be less than 15 %. Pending the
decisions on the final shape of the definitive regime, the committee agreed with the Commission's proposal to retroactively maintain the
principle of a minimum standard VAT rate of 15 %. It proposed that the current arrangements be extended for three years until 31 December
2018 (instead of 31 December 2017 as proposed by the Commission).

2015/0296(CNS) - 12/04/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 568 votes to 85, with 59 abstentions, in the framework of a special legislative procedure (Parliaments
consultation), a legislative resolution on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value
added tax, with regard to the duration of the obligation to respect a minimum standard rate.
Parliament approved the Commissions proposal to retroactively maintain the principle of a minimum standard VAT rate of 15 %. It proposed
however that the current arrangements of the VAT Directive be extended for three years until 31 December 2018 (instead of 31 December
2017 as proposed by the Commission).

2015/0296(CNS) - 25/05/2016 Final act
PURPOSE: to extend, until 31 December 2017, the current situation where the minimum standard rate of VAT in Member States is at 15 %.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Council Directive (EU) 2016/856 amending Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax, as regards
the duration of the obligation to respect a minimum standard rate.
CONTENT: this Council Directive amends the VAT Directive (Directive 2006/112/EC) in order to extend from 1 January 2016 to 31 December
2017 the period of application of the current minimum standard rate of VAT in Member States, set at 15 %.
The text recalled that the standard VAT rate currently in force in the Member States, combined with the mechanism of the transitional system
has ensured that the VAT system has functioned to an acceptable degree. In view of the ongoing discussion on the features of the definitive
VAT regime for intra-Union trade, it would be premature to set a permanent standard VAT rate or to consider changing the minimum VAT rate.
The maintenance of the current minimum standard rate does not preclude a further revision of VAT legislation before 31 December 2017 to
address the introduction of a definitive VAT regime for intra-Union trade.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 1.6.2016. In order to ensure the uninterrupted application of the minimum standard rate established by the VAT
Directive, this Directive shall apply from 1 January 2016.
TRANSPOSITION: 1.8.2016 at the latest.
