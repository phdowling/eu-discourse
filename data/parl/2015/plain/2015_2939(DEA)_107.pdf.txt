Summary

2015/2939(DEA) - 16/12/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament decided to raise no objections to the Commission delegated regulation of 30 October 2015 amending Delegated
Regulation (EU) No 1268/2012 on the rules of application of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the
Council on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union.
In its resolution, Parliament recalled that Directives 2014/23/EU on the award of concession contracts and 2014/24/EU on public procurement
made it necessary to modify both Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1268/2012 on the
rules of application of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 as regards the EU institutions procurement procedures and contracts awarded
on their own account.
Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 was thus modified by Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2015/1929 which aligned it with the abovementioned
directives and entered into force on 30 October 2015.
On 30 October 2015, the Commission adopted the delegated regulation with a view to ensuring that the corresponding update of Commission
Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1268/2012 can apply from the beginning of the financial year, ensuring a clear-cut transition to the new rules on
EU public procurement and concession contracts.
