2015/0249(NLE) - 27/10/2015 Initial legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude Revision 3 of the Agreement of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe concerning the adoption of
uniform technical prescriptions for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted and/or used on wheeled vehicles and the
conditions for the reciprocal recognition of approvals granted on the basis of these prescriptions ('Revised 1958 Agreement').
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
CONTENT: under this proposal, the Council is called upon to approve, on behalf of the Union, Revision 3 of the Agreement of the United
Nations Economic Commission for Europe concerning the adoption of uniform technical prescriptions for wheeled vehicles, equipment and
parts which can be fitted and/or used on wheeled vehicles and the conditions for the reciprocal recognition of approvals granted on the basis
of these prescriptions.
To recall, the Agreement of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe concerning the adoption of uniform technical prescriptions
for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted and/or used on wheeled vehicles and the conditions for the reciprocal
recognition of approvals granted on the basis of these prescriptions entered into force in 1995.
WP.29 agreed, at its 150th session in March 2010, to establish an informal group with a view to assisting WP.29 in considering actions on the
future direction for the harmonisation of vehicle regulations under the Revised 1958 Agreement. This future direction should aim at:
fostering the participation of more countries and regional economic integration organisations in the activities of the World Forum;
increasing the number of Contracting Parties to the Revised 1958 Agreement, by improving its functioning and reliability, and thus
ensuring that it remains the key international framework for the harmonisation of technical regulations in the automotive sector.
On 15 July 2013, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations within WP.29 for amending the Agreement.
At its 164th session in November 2014 WP.29 took note of a proposal submitted by a number of Contracting Parties to the Agreement to
increase the voting majority threshold, for the establishment of new UN Regulations and amendments to existing UN Regulations, from the
two-thirds to a four-fifths majority. The representative of the EU announced the intention to establish a coordinated position of the EU Member
States on this proposal.
The proposals for Revision 3 of the Agreement and for increasing the voting majority threshold from two-thirds to four-fifths meet the
negotiation objectives specified in the Council Decision authorising the Commission to open negotiations within WP.29 for Revision 3 of the
Agreement.

Therefore, it is proposed to adopt the proposed amendments to the 1958 Agreement and amend it accordingly.

2015/0249(NLE) - 26/05/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading

The Committee on International Trade adopted the report by Bernd LANGE (S&D, DE) on the draft Council decision on the conclusion of
Revision 3 of the Agreement of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe concerning the adoption of uniform technical
prescriptions for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted and/or used on wheeled vehicles and the conditions for the
reciprocal recognition of approvals granted on the basis of these prescriptions ('Revised 1958 Agreement').
The committee recommended that the European Parliament should give its consent to the conclusion of the Agreement.
In the explanatory memorandum accompanying the report, it is recalled that the automotive industry and the related auxiliary industries are a
core economic sector for the European Union. The automotive sector provides jobs for 12 million people and accounts for 4% of the EUs GDP.
The EU is among the world's biggest producers of motor vehicles and the sector represents the largest private investor in research and
development. The automotive industry presents a well-integrated value chain in which almost all Member States are involved. Moreover, it
offers very high added value along the entire chain and plays an important role in the Eurozone trade balance. In order to maintain the vital
position of the automotive industry, the EU must strengthen the competitiveness of the EU automotive industry and preserve its global
technological leadership.
International regulatory cooperation has the potential to promote a transparent, effective, procompetitive economic environment while
developing and securing the highest levels of protection of health and safety.
The EU must provide support to global technological harmonisation. Common technical requirements like the UNECE framework help reduce
development costs, reduce costs of production and certification and avoid duplication of administrative procedures.
It is of the utmost importance that the EU is able to present its position at the June 2016 UNECE meeting. In this sense, the Council has
requested to do so and to try to vote in Plenary in May. Given that the rapporteur's will is to respect the principle of multilingualism and to give
as much publicity to this consent as possible, the proposal is to vote in the June plenary.

2015/0249(NLE) - 07/06/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 589 votes to 46, with 11 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the draft Council decision on the
conclusion of Revision 3 of the Agreement of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe concerning the adoption of uniform
technical prescriptions for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted and/or used on wheeled vehicles and the conditions for
the reciprocal recognition of approvals granted on the basis of these prescriptions.
In line with the recommendation made by the Committee on International Trade, Parliament gave its consent to the conclusion of the
Agreement.
To recall, the Revised 1958 Agreement of the UNECE concerning the adoption of uniform technical prescriptions for wheeled vehicles,
equipment and parts which can be fitted and/or used on wheeled vehicles and the conditions for the reciprocal recognition of approvals
granted on the basis of these prescriptions entered into force in 1995. It is now necessary to approve the amendments to the Revised 1958
Agreement and amend the Agreement accordingly.
