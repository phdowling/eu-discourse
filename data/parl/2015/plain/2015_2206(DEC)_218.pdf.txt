Summary

2015/2206(DEC) - 23/07/2015 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: presentation of the Court of Auditors' Special Reports in the context of the 2014 Commission discharge.
CONTENT: the European Court of Auditors' (ECA) Special Reports present the results of ECA's performance audits, which cover a wide range
of topics on issues related to the management of EU funds, programmes and policies.
ECA's Special Reports form an integral part of the Discharge procedure, and the European Parliament adopts a separate resolution on the
Special Reports published during the year of the specific Discharge.
The ECA is free to choose when to publish its special reports. It produces around 20 each year.
In addition to its audit reports, the ECA publishes opinions (around 10 per year) on legislative proposals with an impact on EU financial
management, as well as ad hoc publications on EU public finance issues.
All reports are published on the ECAs website in the official EU languages.
The latest special reports may be found on the ECAs website.

The European Parliament adopted by 525 votes to 57, with 60 abstentions, a resolution on the Court of Auditors' special reports in the context
of the 2014 Commission discharge.
Parliament recalled that the special reports of the Court of Auditors provide information on issues of concern related to the implementation of
funds, which are thus useful for Parliament in exercising its role of discharge authority.

decision on the general discharge in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2014,
Section III Commission.
It then returned to each of the reports in question and made a number of recommendations to improve the use of Community Funds.
As regards in particular Special Report No 18/2014 of the Court of Auditors entitled "EuropeAids evaluation and results-oriented monitoring
systems, Parliament encouraged the Court to look into all EuropeAid's funding mechanisms in order to ensure that value for money is
achieved and that Union funding is efficient in advancing Union goals and values. Parliament stated that Union-funded projects should be
aligned with Union policy goals in neighbouring countries, taking into consideration grantees' accountability, and that EU money is fungible.
For the other special reports, plenary confirmed its position laid down in the committee responsible. To recap, these special reports deal with
the following subjects:
Special Report No 18/2014 of the Court of Auditors entitled "EuropeAids evaluation and results-oriented monitoring systems",
