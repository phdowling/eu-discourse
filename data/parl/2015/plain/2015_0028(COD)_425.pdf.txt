2015/0028(COD) - 06/02/2015 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to amend Regulation (EC) No 1007/2009 on trade in seal products to take account of the recommendations and rulings from the
Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) of the World Trade Organisation (WTO).
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 1007/2009 introduced a general ban on placing seal products on the Union's market (Basic Regulation).
Those measures were adopted in response to public moral concerns about the animal welfare aspects of the killing of seals.
At the same time, seal hunting is an integral part of the culture and identity of the Inuit and other indigenous communities and makes a major
contribution to their subsistence. It is for this reason that the Basic Regulation contains:
an exception from the general ban for seal products derived from hunts traditionally conducted by Inuit and other indigenous
communities that contribute to their subsistence ("the IC exception");
exceptions for the import of seal products derived from seals hunted for the sole purpose of the sustainable management of marine
resources on a not-for profit basis and not for commercial reasons (" the MRM exception") as well as for imports of an occasional
nature and which consist exclusively of goods for the personal use of travellers or their families.
An implementing Regulation, Commission Regulation (EU) No 737/2010 lays down detailed rules for the implementation of the Basic
Regulation.
Both acts were challenged by Canada and Norway in the World Trade Organisation (WTO). In June 2014, the WTO Dispute Settlement Body
(DSB) adopted the reports disapproving the IC and MRM exceptions.
·

The MRM exception was found not to be justified as the possible difference in the commercial dimension of commercial hunts and
MRM hunts (small scale, non-profit) was not sufficient to justify the distinction.

·

With regard to the IC exception, while in principle reflecting a legitimate distinction, the Appellate body ruled, that some elements of
its design and application amounted to arbitrary and unjustifiable discrimination.

The purpose of this proposal is to implement the DSB recommendations and rulings with regard to the Basic Regulation.
CONTENT: the proposal to amend Regulation (EC) No 1007/2009 on trade in seal products states that the placing on the market of seal
products shall be allowed only where the seal products result from hunts conducted by Inuit and other indigenous communities, provided that
the following conditions are all satisfied:
the hunt has been traditionally conducted by the community;
the hunt contributes to the subsistence of the community and is not conducted primarily for commercial reasons;
the hunt is conducted in a manner which reduces pain, distress, fear or other forms of suffering of the animals hunted to the extent
possible taking into consideration the traditional way of life and the subsistence needs of the community.
As regards the import of seal products, this shall also be allowed where it is of an occasional nature and consists exclusively of goods for the
personal use of travellers or their families. The nature and quantity of such goods shall not be such as to indicate that they are being imported
for commercial reasons.
DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of
the treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

2015/0028(COD) - 11/06/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading

The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection adopted the report by Cristian-Silviu BU?OI (EPP, RO) on the proposal for a
regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 1007/2009 on trade in seal products.
The committee recommended that the European Parliaments position adopted at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure
should amend the Commission proposal as follows:
Conditions for placing on the market: as regards the IC exception (products from hunts conducted by Inuit or other indigenous communities),
Members stated that the placing on the market of seal products shall be allowed only where the seal products result from hunts conducted by
Inuit and other indigenous communities, provided that the following conditions are all satisfied:
the hunt has traditionally been conducted by the community and remains a part of the culture and identity of that community;
the hunt is conducted for and contributes to subsistence of the community, including in order to provide food and income to support life
and sustainable livelihood, and is not conducted primarily for commercial reasons;
the hunt is conducted in a manner, which has due regard to animal welfare and takes into consideration the traditional way of life and
the subsistence needs of the community.
Hunting for commercial purposes: Members stressed that the Commission may adopt measures on the basis of evidence, if the conditions for
placing seal products on the market in the Union are not complied with, for example if the seal hunt is not conducted for subsistence needs
and is primarily commercial. The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in order to limit or prohibit the placement on the
market and the quantity of products resulting from that hunt.
Public information: the report included a new Article which refers to the need to ensure, at a reasonable and non-excessive cost, that the
public is informed that the seal products placed on the market originating from hunts conducted by Inuit and other indigenous communities
comply with applicable legal rules.
Awareness-raising campaigns on this issue are also conducted under Objective II set out in the Regulation on a multiannual consumer
programme for the years 2014-2020.
Reporting: the proposed amendment lays down new deadlines for the Commission and the Member States.
By 31 December 2016 and every four years thereafter, Member States shall submit to the Commission a report outlining the actions taken to
implement this Regulation. The Commission shall submit a report on the implementation of this Regulation within 12 months of the end of each
reporting period referred to in the Regulation. The first report shall be submitted by 31 December 2017.
In its assessment the Commission shall, in particular, take into consideration the socio-economic development, nutrition, culture and identity of
the Inuit and other indigenous communities, as well as the environmental and socio-economic effects of this Regulation in areas where seal
hunts are conducted by coastal communities as part of maritime resource management.

2015/0028(COD) - 08/09/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 631 votes to 31, with 33 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 1007/2009 on trade in seal products.
Parliaments position adopted at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure amended the Commission proposal as follows:
Conditions for placing on the market: the amended text stressed that seal hunting is an integral part of the socio-economy, nutrition, culture
and identity of the Inuit and other indigenous communities, making a major contribution to their subsistence and development, providing food
and income to support the life and sustainable livelihood of the community, preserving and continuing the traditional existence of the
community.
As regards the IC exception (products from hunts conducted by Inuit or other indigenous communities), Parliament stated that the placing on
the market of seal products shall be allowed only where the seal products result from hunts conducted by Inuit and other indigenous
communities, provided that the following conditions are all satisfied:
the hunt has traditionally been conducted by the community;
the hunt is conducted for and contributes to subsistence of the community, including in order to provide food and income to support life
and sustainable livelihood, and is not conducted primarily for commercial reasons;
the hunt is conducted in a manner, which has due regard to animal welfare and takes into consideration the way of life of the
Community and the subsistence purpose of the hunt.
Attesting document: at the time of its being placed on the market, a seal product shall be accompanied by a document attesting compliance
with specific conditions. An attesting document shall, upon request, be issued by a body recognised for that purpose by the Commission. Such
recognised bodies shall be independent, competent to carry out their functions and subject to an external audit.
The Commission shall adopt implementing acts to further specify the administrative arrangements for the recognition of bodies that may attest
to the compliance with the conditions set out in the Regulation.
Hunting for commercial purposes: if there is evidence that a seal hunt is conducted primarily for commercial reasons, the Commission shall be
empowered to adopt delegated acts in order to prohibit the placing on the market or limit the quantity that may be placed on the market of seal
products resulting from the hunt concerned.
Information: the Commission shall inform the public, with a view to raising their awareness, and competent authorities, including customs
authorities, of the provisions of this Regulation and of the rules under which seal products resulting from hunts conducted by Inuit or other
indigenous communities can be placed on the market.
Reporting: by 31 December 2018 and every four years thereafter, Member States shall submit to the Commission a report outlining the actions
taken to implement this Regulation. The Commission shall submit a report on the implementation of this Regulation within 12 months of the
end of each reporting period. The first report shall be submitted by 31 December 2019.

In its report, the Commission shall assess the functioning, effectiveness and impact of this Regulation in achieving its objective.

2015/0028(COD) - 06/10/2015 Final act
PURPOSE: to amend Regulation (EC) No 1007/2009 on trade in seal products to take account of the recommendations and rulings from the
Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) of the World Trade Organisation (WTO).
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Regulation (EU) 2015/1775 of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 1007/2009 on
trade in seal products and repealing Commission Regulation (EU) No 737/2010
CONTENT: to recall, Regulation (EC) No 1007/2009 was adopted with the objective of eliminating obstacles to the functioning of the internal
market due to differences in national measures regulating trade in seal products. the Basic Regulation contains:
an exception to the general ban for seal products derived from hunts traditionally conducted by Inuit and other indigenous
communities that contribute to their subsistence ("the IC exception");
exceptions for the import of seal products derived from seals hunted for the sole purpose of the sustainable management of marine
resources.
The amendments made to Regulation (EC) No 1007/2009 are as follows:
Exceptions to the ban established by the EU: the new Regulation:
deletes the exception for seal products derived from hunts conducted for the sustainable management of marine resources.
Nevertheless, the Regulation notes that the removal of the exception relating to the sustainable management of marine resources may
create problems in Member States where carcasses derived from legal seal hunts have been used as material for seal products which
have been placed on the local markets occasionally and in small quantities. the Commission must therefore take this into account
when evaluating the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 1007/2009;
clarifies the exception for seal products derived from hunts conducted by Inuit or other indigenous communities. The placing on the
market of seal products will be allowed only where the following three conditions are fulfilled:
1. the hunt has traditionally been conducted by the community;
2. the hunt is conducted for and contributes to the subsistence of the community, including in order to provide food and income to
support life and sustainable livelihood, and is not conducted primarily for commercial reasons;
3. the hunt is conducted in a manner which has due regard to animal welfare, taking into consideration the way of life of the community
and the subsistence purpose of the hunt.
The import of seal products shall also be allowed where it is of an occasional nature and consists exclusively of goods for the personal use of
travellers or their families.
Attesting document: at the time of its being placed on the market, a seal product shall be accompanied by a document attesting compliance
with the three conditions above. An attesting document shall, upon request, be issued by a body recognised for that purpose by the
Commission. Such recognised bodies shall be independent, competent to carry out their functions and subject to an external audit.
Seal hunt conducted primarily for commercial reasons: if there is evidence that a seal hunt is conducted primarily for commercial reasons, the
Commission may prohibit the placing on the market or limit the quantity that may be placed on the market of seal products resulting from the
hunt concerned.
Information: the Commission shall inform the public, with a view to raising their awareness, and competent authorities, including customs
authorities, of the provisions of the Regulation and of the rules under which seal products resulting from hunts conducted by Inuit or other
indigenous communities can be placed on the market.
Reporting: by 31 December 2018 and every four years thereafter, Member States shall submit to the Commission a report outlining the actions
taken to implement this Regulation. The Commission shall submit a report on the implementation of the Regulation within 12 months of the
end of each reporting period. The first report shall be submitted by 31 December 2019.
In its reports, the Commission shall assess the functioning, effectiveness and impact of the Regulation in achieving its objective.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 10.10.2015. The Regulation is applicable from 18.10.2015
DELEGATED ACTS: the Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts to prohibit the placing on the market or limit the quantity that may
be placed on the market of seal products resulting from the hunt concerned. The power to adopt such acts is conferred on the Commission for
a period of five years (which may be tacitly renewed) from 10 October 2015. The European Parliament or the Council may express objections
to a delegated act within two months from the date of notification (which may be extended for two months). If Parliament or Council express
objections, the delegated act will not enter into force.
