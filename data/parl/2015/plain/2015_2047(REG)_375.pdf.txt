Summary

2015/2047(REG) - 17/03/2015 Vote in committee, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which had been consulted on the application of paragraph 1(a) of Annex XVI to the Rules of
Procedure, provided the following interpretation on that provision:
'Scrutiny of the declaration of financial interests of a Commissioner-designate by the committee responsible for legal affairs consists not only in
verifying that the declaration has been duly completed but also in assessing whether a conflict of interests may be inferred from the content of
the declaration. It is then for the committee responsible for the hearing to decide whether or not it requires further information from the
Commissioner-designate.'
