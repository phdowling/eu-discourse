2015/2169(DEC) - 23/07/2015 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: presentation by the Commission of the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2014, as part of
the 2014 discharge procedure.
Analysis of the accounts of the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA).
CONTENT: this Commission document sets out the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2014 as
prepared on the basis of the information presented by the institutions, organisations and bodies of the EU, in accordance with Article 148 (2) of
the Financial Regulation applicable to the EU's General Budget, including the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA).
The document contains the figures on which the discharge procedure is based.
On this basis, the Financial Controller of the European Commission ensures the certification of the consolidated accounts as declared by the
institutions, agencies and bodies of the European Union.
Discharge procedure of the EU agencies: the EU Budget finances a wide range of policies and programmes throughout the EU. In accordance
with the priorities set by the European Parliament and the Council in the multi-annual financial framework (MFF), the European Commission
carries out specific programmes, activities and projects in the field with the technical support of some specialised agencies.
The consolidated annual accounts of the EU provide information on the activities of the institutions, agencies and other bodies of the EU from
a budgetary and accrual accounting perspective.
The consolidated reports on the implementation of the general budget of the EU include the budget implementation of all Institutions. Agencies
do not have a separate budget inside the EU budget; and they are partially financed by a Commission budget subsidy.

This document sets out how the Agencies spent and implemented their budget in 2014. Each agency is subject to its own discharge
procedure.
EU-OSHA: in 2014, the tasks and budget of this agency were as follows:
description of the Agency's tasks: the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, which is located in Bilbao (ES), was
established by Council Regulation (EC) No 2062/94. The Agency's task is to collect and disseminate information on national and
Union priorities in the field of health and safety at work and to promote cooperation and the exchange of information, including
information on training programmes;
the Agency's budget for the 2014 financial year: the Agencys budget for 2014, as presented in the Commission document on the
consolidated annual accounts of the European Union, gives the following figures:
Commitment appropriations :
- committed : EUR 17 million;
- paid : EUR 16 million;
- carried-over : EUR 2 million.
Payment appropriations :
- committed : EUR 22 million;
- paid : EUR 16 million;
- carried-over : EUR 5 million.
Please refer also to the final accounts of the EU-OSHA.

2015/2169(DEC) - 08/09/2015 Court of Auditors: opinion, report
PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work
(EU-OSHA) for the financial year 2014, together with the Agencys reply.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit concerned, amongst others, the annual accounts of the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA).
Statement of Assurance: pursuant to the provisions of Article 287 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the Court
has audited:
the annual accounts of the Agency, which comprise the financial statements and the reports on the implementation of the budget for
the financial year ended 31 December 2014;
the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying those accounts.
Opinion on the reliability of the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the Agencys annual accounts present fairly, in all material respects, its
financial position as at 31 December 2014 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the
provisions of its Financial Regulation and the accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
Opinion on the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the accounts: the Court considers that the transactions underlying the
annual accounts for the year ended 31 December 2014 are legal and regular in all material respects.
The report also makes a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of the Agency, accompanied by the latters
response. The main observations may be summarised as follows:
The Courts observations:
budgetary management: the Court notes that the level of committed appropriations carried over to 2015 for administrative expenditure
was high at 34 %, mainly owing to the purchase of goods and services, as planned, at the end of the year in connection with the
Agencys fitting out of its new premises, with the renewal of annual IT contracts and the cost of audit services;
remunerations of officials: in 2005 new EU Staff Regulations entered into force, including provisions that future remunerations of
officials recruited before 1 May 2004 should not be less than under the previous EU Staff Regulations. The Courts audit revealed that
this was not complied with and, in the case of 1 of the 26 officials employed at that time, this led to an underpayment of EUR 5 300 for
the period 2005 to 2014.
The Agencys replies:
budgetary management : the Agency confirms that reasons given by the Court for the high level of carry-overs.
remunerations of officials: the Agency indicates that the problem raised by the Court has now been resolved.
Lastly, the Court of Auditors report contains a summary of the Agencys activities in 2014. This is focused on the following:
Budget: EUR 17.3 million of which the Union subsidy amounts to 84.1%.
Activities:
anticipating change: foresight of new and emerging OSH risks associated with new technologies in green jobs and prospective study
in this area;

facts and figures: European survey of enterprises on new & emerging risks (ESENER), OSH overview of risks to older workers,
workers in micro and small enterprises and work-related diseases (e.g. work-related cancer);
tools for OSH management, such as online interactive risk assessment (OiRA) tool or tools for implementing OSH solutions;
raising awareness: inter alia, organisation of the 2014-2015 campaign Healthy Workplaces Manage Stress and of Healthy Workplace
Campaign 2016-2017;
networking knowledge, particularly with the establishment of OSHwiki to provide guidance on strategic issues on OSH;
networking and corporate communication: strategic networking and preparatory measures for third countries (the Western Balkans
and Turkey).

2015/2169(DEC) - 27/01/2016 Supplementary non-legislative basic document
Having examined the revenue and expenditure accounts for the financial year 2014 and the balance sheet as at 31 December 2014 of the
European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA), as well as the Court of Auditors' report on the annual accounts of the Agency for
the financial year 2014, accompanied by the Agency's replies to the Court's observations, the Council recommended the European Parliament
to give a discharge to the Director of the Agency in respect of the implementation of the budget for the financial year 2014.
The Council welcomed the Court's opinion that, in all material respects, the Agency's annual accounts present fairly its financial position as at
31 December 2014 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions of the
Agency's Financial Regulation, and that the underlying transactions for 2014 are legal and regular in all material respects.
Nevertheless, the Council has made some observations which may be summarised as follows:
financial programming: the Council encouraged the Agency to continue improving its financial programming and monitoring of the
budget implementation in order to reduce the level of commitments carried over to the next financial year to the strict minimum, in line
with the budgetary principle of annuality;
staff remuneration: the Council noted the Court's observation that the Agency had not complied with certain of the Staff Regulations'
provisions on remuneration and welcomes the Agency's corrective action.

2015/2169(DEC) - 12/04/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Derek VAUGHAN (S&D, UK) on discharge in respect of the implementation of the
budget of the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work for the financial year 2014.
The parliamentary committee calls on the European Parliament to grant the Director of the Agency discharge in respect of the implementation
of the agencys budget for the financial year 2014.
Noting that the Court of Auditors issued a statement of assurance as to the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the
underlying transactions for the financial year 2014, Members call on Parliament to approve the closure of the Agencys accounts. They made,
however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is granted, in addition to the general
recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies:
·

Agencys financial statements: Members note the final budget of the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work for the financial
year 2014 was EUR 17 256 026, representing a decrease of 1.17 % compared to 2013.

·

Budget and financial management: Members note that the budget monitoring efforts during the financial year 2014 resulted in the
budget implementation rate of 98.65 %, and that the payment appropriations execution rate was 75.59 %. They note, however, that
the level of committed appropriations carried over to 2015 for administrative expenditure was at EUR 443 412 or 34 % of this budget
heading.

Members also made a series of observations regarding the prevention and management of conflicts of interest, payment transfers, as well as
on contract award, recruitment and internal audit and control procedures.
Members note that the Agencys move to its new premises was completed late in 2013 but fully implemented in 2014 and welcomes the fact
that the move has resulted in substantial savings on rent. They welcome the fact that the seat agreement with the Spanish authorities secures
the Agencys home in the long term.
Lastly, Members note that 2014 was the first year of the of the Agencys new multiannual strategic programme for the years 2014 to 2020.
They appreciate the positive indications regarding the Agency's achievements during the first year of the strategy in regard to its priority areas.
