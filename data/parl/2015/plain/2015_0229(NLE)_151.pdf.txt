2015/0229(NLE) - 01/10/2015 Initial legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude a Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Fisheries Partnership
Agreement between the European Community and Mauritania.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: on the basis of an authorization from Council, the Commission negotiated, on behalf of the EU, the renewal of the Protocol
setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European
Community and Mauritania. At the end of those negotiations, a new Protocol was initialled on 10 July 2015.
It is now appropriate to conclude that Protocol.
CONTENT: the draft decision calls on the Council to approve the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution
provided for in the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and Mauritania for a period of four years on behalf of
the Union.
Objectives: the main aim of the Protocol is to grant fishing opportunities to European Union vessels in Mauritanian waters taking into account
available scientific assessments, in particular those of the Fishery Committee for the Eastern Central Atlantic (CECAF), and in accordance with
scientific advice and the recommendations of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), within the limits of
the available surplus.
The objective is to also enhance cooperation between the European Union and Mauritania, thereby creating a partnership framework within
which to develop a sustainable fisheries policy and sound exploitation of fishery resources in the fishing zone of the Islamic Republic of
Mauritania, in the interests of both parties.
Fishing opportunities: the Protocol provides for fishing opportunities in the following categories:
Vessels fishing for crustaceans other than spiny lobster and crab: 5 000 tonnes and 25 vessels (Category 1);
Black hake (non-freezer) trawlers and bottom longliners: 6 000 tonnes and 6 vessels (Category 2);
Vessels fishing for demersal species other than black hake with gear other than trawls: 3 000 tonnes and 6 vessels (Category 3);
Tuna seiners: 12 500 tonnes (reference tonnage) and 25 vessels (Category 4);
Pole-and-line tuna vessels and longliners: 7 500 tonnes (reference tonnage) and 15 vessels (Category 5);
Pelagic freezer trawlers: 247 500 and 19 vessels (Category 6);
Non-freezer pelagic vessels: 15 000 tonnes (deducted from volume under category 6 if used) and 2 vessels (Category 7).
Financial contribution: the annual financial contribution has been set at EUR 59 125 000 per year, on the basis of:
a total allowable catch of 261 500 tonnes for fishing categories 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7 and a reference tonnage of 20 000 tonnes for fishing
categories 4 and 5 of the Protocol, corresponding to an amount linked to access to EUR 55 000 000 per year, and
support for the development of the sectoral fisheries policy of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania amounting to EUR 4 125 000 per
year. This support meets the aims of national fishing policy and in particular the needs of Mauritania as regards supporting scientific
and technical cooperation, training, fisheries monitoring, protecting the environment and development infrastructure.
Duration of the agreement: the Protocol covers a period of four years from the date of provisional application, i.e. from the date of its signature.

In order to facilitate the approval of such amendments, the Commission should be empowered, subject to specific conditions, to approve these
amendments under a simplified procedure (in particular the review of fishing opportunities, decision on the modalities of the sectoral support in
accordance with the Protocol as well as conditions governing fishing activities.

2015/0229(NLE) - 25/04/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Fisheries adopted the report by Gabriel MATO (EPP, ES) on the draft Council decision on the conclusion, on behalf of the
European Union, of the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Fisheries Partnership
Agreement between the European Community and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania for a period of four years.
The committee called on the European Parliament to give its consent to the conclusion of the Protocol.
In a short justification accompanying the report, Members stated that the new agreement has remedied some of the shortcomings that
undermined the usefulness of the previous protocol. The new protocol also makes improvements for the fleet targeting highly migratory
species.
According to the short justification, the new protocol represents a major step forward by comparison with the previous one, and the new
commitments given by Mauritania in relation to transparency and priority access for the European fleet are welcome, particularly bearing in
mind the bitter experience of previous years.
A further highly positive element is the greater degree of balance that has been achieved between financial contribution and fishing
opportunities. This, along with the changes made to the technical measures, has substantially improved the cost/benefit ratio of the agreement
with Mauritania.
Despite efforts made by the negotiators on improving fishing opportunities, Members regretted that Mauritania remained opposed to certain
landings which will have a significant adverse effect on employment at EU level.
The Commission is urged to raise this issue at the meetings of the Joint Committee, with the aim of finding a solution that will allow landings to
be made at ports in Gran Canaria, which offer better conditions for controlling catches, until such time as Mauritanian ports have more highly
developed infrastructure.
The Joint Committee should also seriously consider any realistic possibility of increasing the quotas allocated to the European fleet, taking
account of stock developments, and including the cephalopod category if at all feasible, even if fishing for these species is initially on an
experimental basis only.

2015/0229(NLE) - 10/05/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 585 votes to 41, with 41 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the draft Council decision on the
conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the
Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania for a period of four years.
In line with the recommendation made by the Committee on Fisheries, Parliament gave its consent to the conclusion of the Protocol.
The main aim of the Protocol is to grant fishing opportunities to European Union vessels in Mauritanian waters taking into account available
scientific assessments, in particular those of the Fishery Committee for the Eastern Central Atlantic (CECAF), and in accordance with scientific
