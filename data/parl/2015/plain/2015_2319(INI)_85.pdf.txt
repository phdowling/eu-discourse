2015/2319(INI) - 12/01/2017 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the own-initiative report by Dennis de JONG (GUE/NGL, NL) on control of the Register and
composition of the Commissions expert groups.
The Committee on Legal Affairs, exercising its prerogative as an associated committee in accordance with Article 54 of the Rules of
Procedure, also gave its opinion on the report.
Members welcomed the Commission Decision of 30 May 2016 establishing horizontal rules on the creation and operation of Commissions
expert groups.
Through the adoption of the new horizontal rules, many concerns previously expressed by Parliament have seemingly been met, in particular
those concerning the need for public calls for applications for the selection of the members of expert groups and concerning the revision of the
Register of Commission expert groups and the creation of synergy between this Register, the Transparency Register of the Commission and
Parliament, and those rules relating to the need to avoid conflicts of interest.
Reform of the system: Members considered that the effective reform of the Commission's expert groups system, based on clear principles of
transparency and balanced composition, will improve the availability and reliability of data, which will in turn help increase people's trust in the
EU. They reiterated the importance of reviving forms of involvement of representatives of civil society and the social partners in crucial areas
such as the transparency and the functioning of the European institutions.
Selection of experts: noting that transparency and coordination of interinstitutional activities are of paramount importance, Members welcomed
the fact that the selection process is now taking place publicly. They stressed that it needs to be clearly visible what practical experience and
qualifications the experts possess.
Moreover, new rules should apply strictly and equally to all Commission expert groups, irrespective of their title to ensure a balanced
representation through participation of representatives of all stakeholders.
According to the report, the Commission is asked to:
make progress towards a more balanced composition of the expert groups;
when creating new expert groups, state clearly in the public call for applications how it defines a balanced composition, which interests
it seeks to be represented, and why;

investigate whether a new complaints mechanism is required, if the definition of balanced composition is contested by interested
stakeholders or whether current arrangements are adequate, Parliament should be associated in this control mechanism;
explore ways to facilitate and encourage the participation of underrepresented organisations or social groups in expert groups (e.g.
experts representing SMEs, consumers, trade unions);
assess the development of an allowance system that supports underrepresented groups in acquiring the necessary expertise;
make it possible for European non-governmental organisations to be represented in the expert groups by representatives of their
national member organisations, when provided with a clear mandate from the European organisations;
provide for the meetings and minutes to be made public;
develop specific guidelines explaining how it interprets the provision that the minutes of the expert groups should be meaningful and
complete;
devote sufficient resources to the activities relating to the Register.
Lastly, Members noted that the Commission has stated that by the end of 2016, the new framework for Commission expert groups will have to
be implemented by all Directorates-General. They requested the Commission to submit to Parliament a report on the implementation and
evaluation at the latest one year after the adoption of the Decision, i.e. before 1 June 2017.

2015/2319(INI) - 14/02/2017 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 663 votes to 16, with 13 abstentions, a resolution on control of the Register and composition of the
Commissions expert groups.
Parliament welcomed the Commission Decision of 30 May 2016 establishing horizontal rules on the creation and operation of Commissions
expert groups. It reiterated the importance of reviving forms of involvement of representatives of civil society and the social partners in crucial
areas.
Reform of the system: Parliament recalled that a lack of transparency has a negative effect on the trust that EU citizens have in the EU
institutions. In this regard, it called for the effective reform of the Commissions expert group system, based on clear principles of transparency
and balanced composition.
Selection of experts: Parliament took the view that the entire selection process should guarantee a high level of transparency and should be
governed by clearer, more concise criteria, with particular emphasis on candidates practical experience, alongside their academic
qualifications, and on possible conflicts of interest the experts might have. It also welcomed the fact that a connection has already been
established between the Register of Commission Expert Groups and the Transparency Register, thus ensuring improved transparency.
The Commission is asked to:
make progress towards a more balanced composition of the expert groups and make it clear, in the public call for application, how it
defines a balanced composition and which interests (economic and non-economic) it seeks to be represented when the expert groups
are established;
investigate whether a new complaints mechanism is required, if the definition of balanced composition is contested by interested
stakeholders or whether current arrangements are adequate, Parliament should be associated in this control mechanism;
explore ways to facilitate and encourage the participation of underrepresented organisations or social groups in expert groups (e.g.
experts representing SMEs, consumers, trade unions);
assess the development of an allowance system that supports underrepresented groups in acquiring the necessary expertise;
make it possible for European non-governmental organisations to be represented in the expert groups by representatives of their
national member organisations, when provided with a clear mandate from the European organisations;
provide for the meetings and minutes to be made public;
develop specific guidelines explaining how it interprets the provision that the minutes of the expert groups should be meaningful and
complete;
devote sufficient resources to the activities relating to the Register.
Lastly, Members noted that the Commission has stated that by the end of 2016, the new framework for Commission expert groups will have to
be implemented by all Directorates-General. They requested the Commission to submit to Parliament a report on the implementation and
evaluation at the latest one year after the adoption of the Decision, i.e. before 1 June 2017.
