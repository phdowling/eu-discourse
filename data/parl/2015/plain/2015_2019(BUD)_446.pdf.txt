2015/2019(BUD) - 09/12/2014 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: to mobilise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) to assist Belgium following redundancies in its steel sector.
PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
CONTENT: Article 12 of Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 laying down the multiannual financial framework for the years
2014-2020 provides that the EGF shall not exceed a maximum annual amount of EUR 150 million (2011 prices) over and above the relevant
headings of the financial framework.
The rules applicable to financial contributions from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) are laid down Regulation (EC) No
1927/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.
On 27 September 2013, Belgium submitted application EGF/2013/007 BE/Hainaut steel (Duferco-NLMK) for a financial contribution from the
EGF, following redundancies linked to the closure of Duferco Belgium SA (Duferco) and to staff reductions at NLMK La Louvière SA (NLMK)
which are both located in La Louvière.
In this context, the Commission examined the application for mobilisation of the EGF to assist Belgium and concluded the following:
Belgium: EGF/2013/007 BE/Hainaut steel (Duferco-NLMK): on 27 September 2013, Belgium submitted the application. It was supplemented
by additional information up to 4 July 2014.
In order to establish the link between the redundancies and major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation, the Belgian
authorities argue that the sector of the production of steel has undergone serious economic disruption, in particular a rapid decline of the EUs
market share. According to data referred to by the Belgian authorities, between 2006 and 2011, the production of crude steel in the EU-27
decreased from 206.9 million tonnes to 177.7 million tonnes (? 14.1 %; ? 3.0 % annual growth), whereas, at worldwide level, production
increased from 1 249.0 million tonnes to 1 518.3 million tonnes (+ 21.6 %; + 4.0 % annual growth). This has led to a decrease of the EU-27s

market share in the production of crude steel, measured in volume terms, from 16.6 % in 2006 to 11.7 % in 2011 (? 29.4 %; ? 6.7 % annual
growth).
By comparison, during the same period, Chinas market share increased from 33.7 % to 45.0 % (+ 33.6 %; + 6.0 % annual growth), whereas
the market shares of the five other largest producers (which account together for around 25 % to 30 % of worldwide production) either
decreased, although to a lesser extent than for the EU-27 (Japan, USA, Russia), or increased moderately (South Korea, India). These data
therefore show a rapid decline of the EUs market share in the sector of the production of crude steel at worldwide level.
The effects of these changes in trade patterns have been worsened by other factors such as a decrease in demand in steel in the automotive
and construction sectors in the EU as a consequence of the economic crisis and a relative increase of production costs (raw materials, energy,
environmental constraints, etc.). These factors have harmed the competiveness of the EUs steel industry and have led to a high number of job
losses in the steel sector in recent years due to plant closures and restructuring by several steel manufacturers in Europe. For instance,
between 2008 and 2013, the number of persons employed in the metallurgic industry (NACE Rev. 2 division 24 Manufacture of basic metals)
in the EU-27 decreased by around 280 000 from 1.44 million to 1.16 million (? 19.4 %).
Since the start of the EGF in 2007, there have been four EGF applications in the steel sector.
Belgium introduced its application under the intervention criteria of Article 2(b) of the EGF Regulation, which requires at least 500
redundancies over a period of nine months in enterprises operating in the same economic sector defined at NACE Rev. 2 division level and
located in one region or two contiguous regions defined at NUTS 2 level in a Member State.
The application relates to 708 redundancies made during a period of nine months from 22 January 2013 to 22 October 2013 (which includes
381 redundancies at Duferco and 327 redundancies at NLMK). Duferco and NLMK are located in the same NUTS level 2 region (BE32 Prov.
Hainaut) and operate in the same sector of economic activity (NACE Rev. 2 division 24 Manufacture of basic metals).
On the basis of the application from Belgium, the proposed contribution from the EGF to the coordinated package of personalised services is
EUR 981 956, representing 50% of the total cost.
FINANCIAL IMPLICATION: considering the maximum possible amount of a financial contribution from the EGF, as well as the scope for
reallocating appropriations, the Commission proposes to mobilise the EGF for the total amount referred to above.
The proposed decision to mobilise the EGF will be taken jointly by the European Parliament and the Council, as laid down in point 13 of the
Interinstitutional Agreement of 2 December 2013 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline,
on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management.
The Commission presents separately a transfer request in order to enter in the 2015 budget specific commitment appropriations, as required
in Point 13 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 2 December 2013.

2015/2019(BUD) - 02/03/2015 Budgetary report tabled for plenary, 1st reading
The Committee on Budgets adopted the report by Andrej PLENKOVI? (EPP, HR) on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament
and of the Council on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for an amount of EUR 981 956 in commitment and
payment appropriations to assist Belgium affected by redundancies in its steel sector.
Members recalled that the Union set up legislative and budgetary instruments to provide additional support to workers who are suffering from
the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns and to assist their reintegration into the labour market.
Belgian application: Belgium submitted application EGF/2013/007 BE/Hainaut steel for a financial contribution from the EGF following 708
redundancies in two companies, linked to the closure of Duferco and to staff reductions at NLMK, operating in the NACE 2 Division 24
'Manufacturing of basic metals', and both located in La Louvière in the Hainaut region. The redundancies took place during the reference
period from 22 January 2013 to 22 October 2013 and are linked to a decline of the Union's market share in in the sector of steel production.
Members noted that the conditions set out in Article 2(b) of the EGF Regulation are met. Therefore, Belgium is entitled to a financial
contribution under that Regulation.
Members welcomed the fact that, in order to provide workers with speedy assistance, the Belgian authorities decided to initiate the
implementation of the personalised services to the affected workers on 1 June 2013, well ahead of the decision and even the application on
granting the EGF support for the proposed coordinated package.
Nature of the redundancies: Members considered that the redundancies at Duferco and NLMK are expected to have a negative impact on the
Hainaut region, a former coal-mining and steelmaking area in which employment is strongly dependant on traditional heavy industry and on
the public sector, where in 2012 the unemployment rate was 17.7%, compared to 15.8% on average in Wallonia and 11.2% at national level
and peaked at 39% for the persons aged from 18 to 25. Members highlighted that the low level of qualification of jobseekers (51% do not have
higher secondary education, compared to 47% in Wallonia) is an additional difficulty for the job search.
A package of personalised services: Members noted that the coordinated package of personalised services to be co-funded includes following
measures for the reintegration of 701 redundant workers into employment (grouped by category): (1) individual job-search assistance, case
management and general information services, (2) training and retraining and (3) promotion of entrepreneurship.
Members also noted that, in the context of the economic situation and the number of redundancies in the metallurgic industry in the region, in
order to find a new job in that region, the workers from Duferco and NLMK will have to retrain to find jobs in other occupations and other
sectors. They stated that the proposed measures also target a group of managers of the companies concerned. They recalled the importance
of improving the employability of all workers by means of adapted training and the recognition of skills and competences gained throughout a
worker's professional career.
Lastly, they also stressed that EGF assistance can co-finance only active labour market measures which lead to durable, long-term
employment.

2015/2019(BUD) - 10/03/2015 Budgetary text adopted by Parliament
The European Parliament adopted by 534 votes to 77, with 12 abstentions, a resolution on the proposal for a decision of the European

Lastly, Parliament noted that measures which are mandatory under collective redundancy procedures in Belgium and which are carried out as
part of the standard activities of the Redeployment Units (e.g. outplacement support, training, job-search assistance and careers advice, etc.)
are not included in this EGF application. More than half of the total estimated costs are to be spent on redeployment services, namely support,
guidance and integration measures.
