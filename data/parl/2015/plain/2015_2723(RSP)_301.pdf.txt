Summary

2015/2723(RSP) - 22/06/2015 Resolution/conclusions adopted by Council
On 22 June 2015, the Council adopted conclusions on Burundi.
Faced with the critical situation in Burundi, the EU welcomed the fact that the region has mobilised to find a solution. The decisions on the
situation in Burundi adopted at the African Union (AU) summit of 13 June, as well as the conclusions of the East African Community (EAC)
summit of 31 May 2015, establish an indispensable framework for enabling Burundi to overcome the crisis.
Recalling the Council conclusions of 16 March and 18 May 2015, the EU shared the view expressed by the AU, the EAC and the United
Nations (UN) that only through dialogue and consensus, can a lasting political solution be found in the interests of security and democracy for
all Burundi's people. It called on all Burundian stakeholders to resume dialogue on all areas of disagreement between the parties, and
undertakes to support them in this.
Conditions for a smooth running election process: the EU called for full compliance with the conditions identified by the AU and the EAC, which
are vital for the credibility and smooth running of the electoral process. It called for greater coordination, supports the mediation efforts made
by the AU, the EAC and the UN, and is ready to support the implementation of the specific measures recently announced by the AU. Both the
EAC and the AU have clearly declared that conditions conducive to the holding of elections are not currently in place . There is a strong
likelihood that it will not be possible to put such conditions in place within the time frames provided for in the Burundian Constitution. The EU
urged the Burundian Government to respond to the decisions taken by the Peace and Security Council of the AU by taking specific steps as
soon as possible.
Towards restrictive measures: the EU expressed its deep concern at the numbers of victims and cases of serious human rights violations
reported since the beginning of the crisis, particularly those abuses attributed to the security forces and to members of the Imbonerakure. It
asked that leaders bring to a halt to the actions that are at the root of this violence. It is determined to adopt, if necessary, targeted restrictive
measures against those whose actions might have led or might lead to acts of violence and repression and serious human rights violations,
and/or might hamper the search for a political solution within the framework proposed by the AU and the EAC. As a preventive measure, the
Council requests that the High Representative initiate preparatory work to that end.
Depending on the reaction of the Burundian Government to the decisions taken by the Peace and Security Council of the AU and on future
developments, the EU is prepared to institute those procedures, including in the area of cooperation, in order to ensure that Burundi respects
those commitments.
Refugees: lastly, the EU expressed its deep concern about the continued outflow of refugees to neighbouring countries. It reiterated its support
for the humanitarian organisations present in the region and congratulated the authorities of the host countries for their open and welcoming
attitude towards those seeking refuge beyond their border.

2015/2723(RSP) - 09/07/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a resolution on the situation in Burundi.
The resolution was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ECR, ALDE, GUE/NGL, Greens/EFA and EFDD groups.
Gravely concerned about the worsening political and humanitarian situation in Burundi and the wider region, Parliament called for an
immediate end to violence and political intimidation of opponents and the immediate disarmament of all armed youth groups allied to political
parties.
It condemned the decision of the Burundian Government to go ahead with the elections despite the critical prevailing political and excessive
use of force against demonstrators. It urged the Burundian authorities to postpone the presidential elections set for 15 July 2015.
It called on all those involved in the electoral process, including the bodies responsible for organising elections and the security services, to
honour the commitments made in the Arusha Agreement, which put an end to the civil war. It emphasised, once again, that only through
dialogue and consensus, involving the Burundian Government, opposition and civil society in accordance with the Arusha Agreement and the
Burundian Constitution, could a lasting political solution be found.
EU Burundi relations: Members recalled that the EUs partnership with Burundi was governed by the Cotonou Agreement, and that all parties
are bound to respect and implement the terms of that agreement, in particular respect for human rights. They called on the Government of
Burundi, therefore, to allow genuine and open political debate to take place without fear of intimidation, and to refrain from misusing the
judiciary to exclude political rivals.
They also asked the Commission to reassess EU aid as a matter of urgency with a view to diverting it, to increasing financial support for civil
society and to focusing on humanitarian aid as opposed to central budget support.
Restrictive measures: Members joined the Foreign Affairs Council of 22 June 2015 in calling for a list of targeted restrictive measures and visa
and travel bans against those responsible for acts of violence, repression and serious human rights violations, together with those who are
actively impeding a political solution. They also asked the VP/HR to take the necessary measures to freeze the assets of all of these
individuals in the EU Member States.
Intimidation: Parliament expressed its deep concern at the number of victims and the number of cases of serious human rights violations
reported since the beginning of the crisis, particularly those abuses attributed to members of the Imbonerakure (CNDD-FDD youth militia). It
demanded that the violence and intimidation exercised by the Imbonerakure be brought to an immediate end called on the CNDD-FDD to
disarm the youth militia.
Members reiterated that there could be no impunity for those responsible for serious human rights violations, and noted that attempts by
certain forces to transform the riots into an ethnic conflict were failing, and that political divisions in Burundi are not explicitly ethnic.

Parliament invited the International Criminal Court prosecutor to monitor media closely for incitement to ethnic hatred, as well as speeches by
political leaders. It reiterated, in this context, the importance of abiding by the Code of Conduct in Electoral Matters and the UN-brokered
election roadmap to prevent a further increase in political violence.
Lifting of restrictions on access to the internet: Members called for the immediate lifting of restrictions on the media and access to the internet,
and denounced once again the repeated targeting of Radio Publique Africaine, which served as one of the countrys principal news outlets.
They considered that legitimate elections could not take place unless media outlets were able to operate without restrictions.
They welcomed the Commissions announcement of an additional EUR 1.5 million to ease the humanitarian situation. Parliament warned,
however, that given the huge influx of refugees into an already fragile region, both the EU and its Member States, must redouble commitments
as a matter of urgency reported outbreaks of cholera and alarming reports of sexual violence.
Lastly, it called on the EU and its Member States to deliver on all commitments to the UN Burundi Regional Refugee Response Plan.
