2015/2833(RSP) - 10/09/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 432 votes to 142 with 57 abstentions, a resolution on migration and refugees in Europe.
The resolution was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ALDE and Greens/EFA groups.
Parliament expressed its deep regret at the tragic loss of lives of people seeking asylum in the EU and urged the EU and Member States to do
everything possible to prevent further loss of life at sea or on land.
Whilst welcoming the efforts of civil society groups and individuals all over Europe who were mobilising in large numbers to welcome and
provide aid to refugees and migrants, Parliament reiterated its support for its resolution of 29 April 2015 on EU migration and asylum policies,
and the need for an immediate response to the current refugee situation based on solidarity and fair sharing of responsibility, as stated in
Article 80 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
Members stressed their commitment to open borders within the Schengen area, while ensuring effective management of external borders,
recalling that the free movement of people within the Schengen area had been one of the biggest achievements of European integration.
Relocation and resettlement: Parliament welcomed the Commissions initiatives on relocation and resettlement, including the new one for
emergency relocation of an increased number of asylum seekers in need of international protection, covering Greece, Italy and Hungary. It
endorsed the announcement by the Commission of a permanent relocation mechanism, and stated it was prepared to deal with the new
emergency relocation scheme under a fast-track procedure, so as to ensure that Member States do not delay the scheme.
Members also welcomed the operational support that the Commission would provide via Hotspots to help Member States with the registration
of people arriving.
Common European Asylum System: Members reiterated their calls on the Commission to amend the existing Dublin Regulation in order to
include a permanent, binding system of distribution of asylum seekers among the 28 Member States, using a fair, compulsory allocation key,
while taking into account the prospects of integration and the needs and specific circumstances of asylum seekers themselves. They want to
see significant budgetary room to support the EASO and the Member States as regards their actions for reception and integration of refugees.
Parliament called for rapid and full transposition and effective implementation of the Common European Asylum System by all participating
Member States.
It recalled that the possibilities for people in need of protection to legally enter the EU were very limited, and deplored the fact that they had no
other option but to resort to criminal smugglers and dangerous routes to find protection in Europe. The EU and its Member States must create
humanitarian corridors and humanitarian visas. Parliament also wanted to see:
a compulsory resettlement programme;
enhanced family reunification,
private sponsorship schemes and flexible visa arrangements, including for study and work;
amendments to the Visa Code by including more specific common provisions on humanitarian visas.
Member States should lay down strong criminal sanctions against human trafficking and smuggling.
Anti-migration sentiments: Members regretted that the leaders of some Member States and the far-right parties were using the current
situation to fuel anti-migration sentiments while blaming the EU for the crisis. They called on the Commission and Member States to take
urgent steps against violent actions and hate speech targeting migrants.
They recalled that migration was a global and complex phenomenon which also required a longterm approach that addressed its root causes,
such as poverty, inequality, injustice, climate change, corruption, ill-governance and armed conflict. They underlined the need for a
comprehensive EU approach, strengthening the coherence of its internal and external policies , and notably its common foreign and security
policy, development policy and migration policy. Parliament questioned plans to link development aid to more border controls or readmission
agreements by third countries.
It called for sustainable political solutions in regions in conflict, such as Iraq, Syria and Libya and the Middle East, and for strengthening
political dialogue, including with regional organisations, encompassing all human rights elements. In this regard, it asked for greater
cooperation with countries in the region within the Arab League and the African Union in order to manage, resettle and grant asylum to
persons in need of protection.
Lastly, Parliament called on the Commission and the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs
and Security Policy to convene an international conference on the refugee crisis, with the participation of the EU, its Member States,
UN-related agencies, the United States, relevant international NGOs and Arab states, among others, with the aim of establishing a common
global humanitarian aid strategy.
