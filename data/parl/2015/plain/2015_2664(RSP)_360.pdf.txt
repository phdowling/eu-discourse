Summary

The European Parliament adopted a resolution on the situation of the Yarmouk refugee camp in Syria.
The text adopted in plenary had been jointly tabled by the EPP, S&D, ECR, ALDE, GUE/NGL, Greens/EFA and EFDD groups.
Parliament condemned the takeover of the Palestinian refugee camp in Yarmouk on 1 April 2015 and the acts of terrorism perpetrated by
IS/Daesh and Jabhat al-Nusra, as well as the siege laid to Yarmouk by the Assad regime and the bombardment of the camp. It urged all
parties involved in the conflict to allow UNRWA, ICRC and other international aid organisations unhindered access to the Yarmouk refugee
camp, to enable immediate and unconditional humanitarian access, to evacuate wounded civilians and provide safe passage for all civilians
wishing to leave the camp.
Parliament expressed its deep concern at the continued deterioration of the security and humanitarian situation in Syria, and reiterated its
strong commitment to supporting the victims of the Syrian conflict. It strongly condemned the abuses against children, massacres, torture,
killings and sexual violence to which the Syrian population is victim.
The European Union is urged to contribute to joint efforts to mitigate the humanitarian crisis and play a role in helping neighbouring countries
provide shelter for refugees fleeing the conflict in Syria, many of whom are losing their lives on boats in the Mediterranean.
Reiterating its call for a sustainable solution to the Syrian conflict through an inclusive and Syrian-led political process, Parliament is convinced
that there can be no sustainable peace in Syria without accountability for the crimes committed by all sides during the conflict.
The resolution called on the EU and its Member States to seriously consider the recent recommendation by the UN Commission of Inquiry to
explore the setting-up of a special tribunal for the crimes committed in Syria.
