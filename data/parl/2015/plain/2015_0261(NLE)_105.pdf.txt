2015/0261(NLE) - 09/11/2015 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to allow Croatia to accede to the Convention of 18 December 1997, drawn up on the basis of Article K.3 of the Treaty of the
European Union, on mutual assistance and cooperation between customs administrations.
PROPOSED ACT: Council recommendation.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to
follow its opinion.
BACKGROUND: the Act of Accession of the Republic of Croatia contains a simplified system for accession of Croatia to the conventions and
protocols concluded by the Member States on the basis of Article 34 TEU (previously Article K.3 TEU) or Article 293 EC. In fact, Article 3(4) of
the Act of Accession simply provides that Croatia accedes to the conventions and protocols by virtue of the Act.
Annex I to the Act of Accession gives the list of conventions and protocols concerned in the Justice and Home Affairs area. This list includes
the Convention of 18 December 1997, drawn up on the basis of Article K.3 of the Treaty on European Union, on mutual assistance and
cooperation between customs administrations.
CONTENT: the Commission recommends to the Council that the Convention of 18 December 1997, drawn up on the basis of Article K.3 of the
Treaty of the European Union, on mutual assistance and cooperation between customs administrations, shall enter into force in relation to
Croatia on the date on which this Decision shall take effect.
The accession of Croatia to the aforementioned Convention does not require adjustments thereto. Hence this Commission Recommendation
for a Council Decision is intended to only determine the date on which the Convention of 18 December 1997 shall enter into force for Croatia.

2015/0261(NLE) - 16/03/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection adopted the report by Liisa JAAKONSAARI (S&D, FI) on the recommendation
for a Council decision concerning the accession of the Republic of Croatia to the Convention of 18 December 1997, drawn up on the basis of
Article K.3 of the Treaty on European Union, on mutual assistance and cooperation between customs administrations.
The parliamentary committee recommended that the European Parliament approve the Commission recommendation.
To recall, the Act of Accession of the Republic of Croatia contains a simplified system for accession of Croatia to the conventions and
protocols concluded by the Member States on the basis of Article 34 TEU (previously Article K.3 TEU) or Article 293 EC. The Act of Accession
simply provides that Croatia accedes to the conventions and protocols by virtue of the Act.
The Commission recommends to the Council that the Convention of 18 December 1997, drawn up on the basis of Article K.3 of the Treaty of
the European Union, on mutual assistance and cooperation between customs administrations, shall enter into force in relation to Croatia on
the date on which this Decision shall take effect.

2015/0261(NLE) - 28/04/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 569 votes to 30, with 24 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the recommendation for a Council
decision concerning the accession of the Republic of Croatia to the Convention of 18 December 1997, drawn up on the basis of Article K.3 of
the Treaty on European Union, on mutual assistance and cooperation between customs administrations.
In line with the recommendation made by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, Parliament approved the
Commission recommendation.

NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Council Decision (EU) 2016/979 concerning the accession of Croatia to the Convention drawn up on the basis of
Article K.3 of the Treaty on European Union, on mutual assistance and cooperation between customs administrations.

assistance and cooperation between customs administrations signed in Brussels on 18 December 1997 shall enter into force in relation to
Croatia on the first day of the first month following the date of publication of this Decision, that is 1 July 2016.
