2015/0313(COD) - 15/12/2015 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to amend Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002 establishing a European Maritime Safety Agency in order to reinforce European
co-operation on coastguard functions to improve cooperation and coordination between the relevant EU agencies in order to enhance
synergies between their respective services.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: national authorities carrying out coastguard functions are responsible for a wide range of missions, including but not limited to
maritime safety, security, search and rescue, border control, fisheries control, customs control, general law enforcement and environmental
protection.
The underlying problem is that coastguard functions, such as border control, maritime safety and security, search and rescue operations,
fisheries control, pollution control etc., are currently carried out by more than 300 authorities in Member States, which are not always well
coordinated even at national level.
The objective of this initiative is to improve European cooperation on coastguard functions by developing cross-sectoral cooperation among
the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) and the European Fisheries Control Agency
(EFCA) to improve synergies between those agencies, in order to provide more efficient and cost-effective multipurpose services to national
authorities carrying out coastguard functions.
The additional tasks for EMSA are fully in line with European Border and Coast Guard Agency and EFCA mandates and will assist them to
also fulfil their duties and tasks.
The European Border and Coast Guard Agency, the European Fisheries Control Agency and the European Maritime Safety Agency should
therefore strengthen their cooperation both with each other and with the national authorities carrying out coastguard functions to increase
maritime situational awareness as well as to support coherent and cost-efficient action.
The additional tasks for EMSA are fully in line with European Border and Coast Guard Agency and EFCA mandates and will assist them to
also fulfil their duties and tasks.
CONTENT: this legislative proposal forms part of a set of measures proposed by the Commission to reinforce the protection of Europe's
external borders, including European cooperation on coastguard function, which also includes proposals for a Regulation establishing a
European Border and Coast Guard Agency and to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 768/2005 establishing a European Fisheries Control
Agency.
The proposal stipulates that the EMSA shall, in cooperation with the European Border and Coast Guard Agency and the European Fisheries
Control Agency, support national authorities carrying out coastguard functions at national and Union level, and where appropriate at
international level by:
sharing information generated by fusing and analysing data available in ship reporting systems and other information systems hosted
by or accessible to the agencies, in accordance with their respective legal bases and without prejudice to the ownership of data by
Member States;
providing surveillance and communication services based on state-of-the-art technology, including space-based and ground
infrastructure and sensors mounted on any kind of platform;
capacity building by elaborating guidelines, recommendations and best practices as well as by supporting the training and exchange
of staff, with a view to enhancing the exchange of information and cooperation on coastguard functions;
capacity sharing, including the planning and implementation of multipurpose operations and the sharing of assets and other
capabilities across sectors and borders.
The Commission may adopt, in the form of a recommendation, a practical handbook on European cooperation on coastguard functions,
containing guidelines, recommendations and best practices for the exchange of information and cooperation at national, Union and
international level.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this initiative requires an increase in the EU contribution to EMSA of around EUR 22 million per year (that is
around EUR 87 million for the 2017 to 2020 period) and the recruitment of 17 TA staff. This is operational expenditure for around EUR 81
million mainly to cover provision of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) services for border control surveillance (EUR 67 million) and
satellite aerial surveillance (SAT-AIS) and Satcom data and services to increase the surveillance capability of the 3 agencies and national
authorities to strengthen as a primary objective the control of the external maritime borders of the European Union.

2015/0313(COD) - 21/06/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Transport and Tourism adopted the report by Michael CRAMER (Greens/EFA, DE) on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002 establishing a European Maritime Safety Agency.
The committee recommended that the European Parliaments position adopted at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure
should adopt its position at first reading taking over the Commission proposal.
To recall, the proposal seeks to improve European cooperation on coastguard functions by developing cross-sectoral cooperation among the
European Border and Coast Guard Agency, the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) and the European Fisheries Control Agency
(EFCA) to improve synergies between those agencies, in order to provide more efficient and cost-effective multipurpose services to national
authorities carrying out coastguard functions.

2015/0313(COD) - 06/07/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 567 votes to 100, with 41 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002 establishing a European Maritime Safety Agency.
The European Parliaments position, adopted at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure, amended the Commission proposal.
Parliament stipulated that the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, the European Fisheries Control Agency and the European Maritime
Safety Agency should therefore strengthen their cooperation, within their mandate, both with each other and with the national authorities
carrying out coastguard functions to increase maritime situational awareness as well as to support coherent and cost-efficient action.
The Agency shall support national authorities by:
enhancing the exchange of information and cooperation on coast guard functions including by analysing operational challenges and
emerging risks in the maritime domain;
capacity sharing by planning and implementation of multipurpose operations and the sharing of assets and other capabilities, to the
extent those are coordinated by the agencies and with the agreement of the competent authorities of the Member States concerned.
A working arrangement shall determine the modalities of the cooperation and shall be approved by the Administrative Boards of the Agency,
the European Fisheries Control Agency and the Management Board of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency.
The Commission shall adopt, in close cooperation with the Member States, a handbook on European cooperation on coast guard functions in
the form of a recommendation.
The tasks set out to enhance cooperation shall not be detrimental to the Agency's tasks and not infringe upon Member States' rights and
obligations, in particular as flag States, port States and coastal States.
A new recital has been added in order to allow for an efficient and effective support to national authorities carrying out coastguard functions,
the Agency shall make use of available state-of-the-art technology, such as remotely piloted aircraft systems (drones).

2015/0313(COD) - 14/09/2016 Final act
PURPOSE: to strengthen cooperation between the European Maritime Safety Agency, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, and
the European Fisheries Control Agency, and with the national authorities carrying out coast guard functions.
