Summary

2015/0811(CNS) - 01/10/2015 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to approve the conclusion by Eurojust of the Memorandum of Understanding between the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal
Market and Eurojust.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Implementing Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to
follow its opinion.
BACKGROUND: Decision 2002/187/JHA provides that Eurojust may conclude agreements or working arrangements with the institutions,
bodies and agencies set up by, or on the basis of, the Treaties. Such agreements or working arrangements may, in particular, concern the
exchange of information, including personal data, and the secondment of liaison officers to Eurojust. Such agreements or working
arrangements may only be concluded after consultation by Eurojust with the Joint Supervisory Body concerning the provisions on data
protection and after the approval by the Council.
In order to strengthen its capacity to work with the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market established by Council Regulation (EC) No
207/2009, Eurojust has negotiated a Memorandum of Understanding between the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market and Eurojust.
The Memorandum was approved by the College of Eurojust on 19 May 2015.
CONTENT: in accordance with the draft implementing Decision, Eurojust is authorised to conclude the Memorandum of Understanding
between the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market and Eurojust.
Denmark, the United Kingdom and Ireland shall take part in the adoption and application of this Decision.

2015/0811(CNS) - 07/12/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Legal Affairs adopted, in the framework of a special legislative procedure (Parliaments consultation), the report by Kostas
CHRYSOGONOS (GUE/NGL, EL) on the draft Council implementing decision approving the conclusion by Eurojust of the Memorandum of
Understanding between the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market and Eurojust.
The Committee on Legal Affairs recommended the European Parliament to approve the Council draft aiming to formalise the conclusion by
Eurojust of the Memorandum of Understanding between the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (OHIM), for which the Committee
on Legal Affairs is responsible.
The purpose of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) is to foster cooperation between Eurojust and OHIM in compliance with their
respective mandates.
The explanatory statement accompanying the report highlighted a provision which is particularly worthy of attention is Article 3(5) of the MoU,
whereby the exchange of information or experience provided for in this MoU shall not include the transmission of operational information
including data relating to an identified or identifiable person. The Rapporteur fully endorsed this approach and called on the Council to be
vigilant of the implementation in practice of the data protection guarantee.
Another interesting provision is Article 6 on settlement of disputes which: (i) stipulates that disputes related to the interpretation or application
of the MoU must be settled by means of consultations and negotiations between representatives of Eurojust and OHIM, thus excluding the
arbitration of any third party; (ii) lays down that in the event of serious failing to comply with the provisions of the MoU, or if Eurojust or OHIM is
of the view that such failing may occur in the near future, either of them may suspend the application of the MoU temporarily, pending the
consultations and negotiations.

2015/0811(CNS) - 15/12/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 571 votes to 59, with 56 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the draft Council implementing decision
approving the conclusion by Eurojust of the Memorandum of Understanding between the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market and
Eurojust.
Parliament approved the Council draft under the Parliaments consultation procedure.
To recall, the draft implementing decision in question formalises the conclusion by Eurojust of the Memorandum of Understanding between the
Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (OHIM). The purpose of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) is to foster cooperation
between Eurojust and OHIM in compliance with their respective mandates.
