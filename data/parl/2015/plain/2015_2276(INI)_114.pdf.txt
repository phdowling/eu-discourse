2015/2276(INI) - 26/04/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Foreign Affairs adopted the own-initiative report by Bogdan Andrzej ZDROJEWSKI (EPPE, PL) on space capabilities for
European security and defence.
The Committee on Industry, Research and Energy exercising its prerogatives as an associated committee in accordance with Rule 54 of the
Rules of Procedure, also gave its opinion on the report.
Members recalled that space policy is an essential component of the strategic autonomy which the EU must develop in order to safeguard
sensitive technological and industrial capabilities and independent capabilities to carry out assessments.
Role of space-based capabilities and services: Members considered that space-based capabilities and services play an important role in the
context of European security and defence and EU policies in areas such as external action, border management, maritime security,
agriculture, the environment, climate action, energy security, disaster management, humanitarian aid and transport.
In this context, the report reaffirmed the importance and the added value of the Space Policy to the CSDP and that space should be included
in future Union policies (e.g. internal security, transport, space, energy, research). It stressed the importance of:
the use of space capabilities in the war against terrorism and terrorist organisations, through the ability to locate and monitor their
training camps;
improving access to space-based satellite communication, space situational awareness, precision navigation and Earth observation
capabilities, and ensure European non-dependence as regards critical space technologies and access to space;
sufficient financial investment to guarantee the autonomy of the EU as regards space structures, while providing the resources
necessary for that purpose.
Space Programmes: Members recalled that the two EU flagship programmes Galileo and Copernicus are civil programmes under civil control
and that the European nature of Galileo and Copernicus has made these programmes possible and ensured their success. They wanted to
ensure that European space programmes develop civilian space-based capabilities and services with relevance for European security and
defence capabilities, particularly through the allocation of adequate funds for research.
Bearing in mind the dual-use capacity of EU space capabilities, Members considered that a holistic, integrated, long-term approach to the
space sector at EU level is necessary, and that the space sector should be mentioned in the new EU Global Strategy on Foreign and Security
Policy.
The EUs needs and strategic objectives: Members asked the Commission to come up swiftly with a definition of EU needs regarding the
potential contribution of the space policy to the CSDP for all the main aspects: launching, positioning, imagery, communication, space weather,
space debris, cyber security, jamming, spoofing and other intentional threats, security of the ground segment.
The development of European space capabilities for European security and defence should follow two key strategic objectives:
security on the planet through in-orbit space systems designed to monitor the earths surface or to provide positioning, navigation and
timing information or satellite communications and

security in outer space as well as space safety, i.e. security in orbit and in space through ground-based and in-orbit space situational
awareness systems.
Operational coordination: the report stressed that cooperation between the Commission, the European External Action Service, the GNSS
Agency, the European Defence Agency, the European Space Agency and the Member States is crucial to improving European space
capabilities and services. The Union should coordinate and support such cooperation through a specific operational coordination centre.
The report also suggested, inter alia:
stimulating space innovation and research for security and defence and innovative big data technologies to make use of the full
potential of space data for security and defence;
the development of the EU's various diplomatic initiatives in space issues, in both a bilateral and a multilateral context, in order to
contribute to the development of the institutionalisation of space;
setting up a permanent programme and to use the European added value of the EDA for military satellite communication as well;
identifying any potential technological gap to facilitate EU-US cooperation on future space-based capabilities;
continuing to facilitate the establishment of an international code of conduct on outer space activities, in order to protect space
infrastructure while preventing a weaponisation of space;
ensuring that space situational awareness / space weather, satellite communication, electronic intelligence and early warning could
benefit from greater cooperation between the public and private sectors, and additional EU-level support;
assessing how to meet the operational need for very high resolution earth observation data under the Copernicus programme;
the further development of the EUs own Space Surveillance and Tracking (SST) capacities;
developing policies and research capabilities in order to provide future applications and develop a competitive European industry,
capable of commercial success based on a healthy economic environment;
establishing the correct regulatory and policy frameworks in order to give industry further impetus and incentives to pursue
technological development and research into space capabilities.
Members welcomed the process and plans for the development of new European launchers Ariane 6 and VEGA, and considered the
development of these launchers to be crucial to the long-term viability and independence of the European space programmes. They noted the
strategic importance of independent access to space and the need for dedicated EU action, including with regard to security and defence.
Lastly, Members considered that creating in the long term a legal framework permitting sustained EU-level investments in security and defence
capabilities could foster greater and more systematic European defence cooperation with a view to delivering key capabilities.

2015/2276(INI) - 08/06/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 446 votes to 156, with 71 abstentions, a resolution on space capabilities for European security and
defence.
Members recalled that space policy is an essential component of the strategic autonomy which the EU must develop in order to safeguard
sensitive technological and industrial capabilities and independent capabilities to carry out assessments. They stressed that space capabilities
for European security and defence are important and, in some cases, even vital for a multitude of situations, ranging from day-to-day
peacetime use to crisis management and more acute security challenges, including full-scale warfare. The development of future capabilities
needs to be programmed when current capabilities are being deployed.
Role of space-based capabilities and services: Parliament considered that space-based capabilities and services play an important role in the
context of European security and defence and EU policies in areas such as external action, border management, maritime security,
agriculture, the environment, climate action, energy security, disaster management, humanitarian aid and transport.
In this context, Parliament reaffirmed the importance and the added value of the Space Policy to the CSDP and that space should be included
in future Union policies (e.g. internal security, transport, space, energy, research). It also stressed the importance of:
the use of space capabilities in the war against terrorism and terrorist organisations;
improving access to space-based satellite communication, space situational awareness, precision navigation and Earth observation
capabilities, and ensure European non-dependence as regards critical space technologies and access to space;
the use of satellite capabilities to better assess and identify the flow of illegal immigrants and their routes, and, in the case of those
coming from Northern Africa, to identify the ship-boarding areas in order to engage with them faster and save more lives;
sufficient financial investment to guarantee the autonomy of the EU as regards space structures, while providing the resources
necessary for that purpose.
Space Programmes: Parliament recalled that the two EU flagship programmes Galileo and Copernicus are civil programmes under civil
control and that the European nature of Galileo and Copernicus has made these programmes possible and ensured their success. They
wanted to ensure that European space programmes develop civilian space-based capabilities and services with relevance for European
security and defence capabilities, particularly through the allocation of adequate funds for research.
Bearing in mind the dual-use capacity of EU space capabilities, Members considered that a holistic, integrated, long-term approach to the
space sector at EU level is necessary, and that the space sector should be mentioned in the new EU Global Strategy on Foreign and Security
Policy.
Parliament noted the importance of Galileos Public Regulated Service (PRS) for navigation and guidance of military systems; calls on the High
Representative and the EU Member States to increase their efforts regarding a possible revision of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty or to initiate a
new regulatory framework that takes account of technological progress since the 1960s and aims to prevent an arms race in space. Members
encouraged the identification and development of security- and defence-related capacity needs for the next generations of the Galileo and
Copernicus systems.
The EUs needs and strategic objectives: Parliament asked the Commission to come up swiftly with a definition of EU needs regarding the
potential contribution of the space policy to the CSDP for all the main aspects: launching, positioning, imagery, communication, space weather,
space debris, cyber security, jamming, spoofing and other intentional threats, security of the ground segment.

setting up a permanent programme and to use the European added value of the EDA for military satellite communication as well;
identifying any potential technological gap to facilitate EU-US cooperation on future space-based capabilities;
strengthen EU-NATO cooperation in the area of security and defence policy and in collective defence;
continuing to facilitate the establishment of an international code of conduct on outer space activities, in order to protect space
infrastructure while preventing a weaponisation of space;
ensuring that space situational awareness / space weather, satellite communication, electronic intelligence and early warning could
