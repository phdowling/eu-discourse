Summary

2015/2673(DEA) - 20/05/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament decided to raise no objections to the Commission delegated regulation of 27 April 2015 amending Annex I to
Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on support for rural development by the European Agricultural
Fund for Rural Development.
It was recalled that Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 provided for a revision of the multiannual financial framework in the event
of the adoption after 1 January 2014 of programmes under shared management for, inter alia, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural
Development in order to transfer to subsequent years, in excess of the corresponding expenditure ceilings, allocations not used in 2014.
the rural development programmes of Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Greece, Spain, Croatia, Italy, Cyprus, Luxembourg, Hungary,
Malta, Romania and Sweden and certain regional programmes of Belgium, Germany, France and the United Kingdom were not ready for
adoption by the end of 2014.
Under these circumstances Regulation 1311/2013 had been revised by Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2015/623, which, for the European
Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, transferred the corresponding unused 2014 allocations to 2015 and 2016 expenditure ceilings.
The delegated regulation under consideration aimed to amend accordingly Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013, which laid down the
breakdown of Union support for rural development for the 2014 to 2020 period.
Members felt that this regulation was essential for the smooth and timely adoption of rural development programmes.
