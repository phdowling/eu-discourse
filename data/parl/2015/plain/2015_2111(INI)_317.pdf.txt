2015/2111(INI) - 17/12/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Womens Rights and Gender Equality adopted the own-initiative report by Barbara MATERA (EPP, IT) on external factors
that represent hurdles to European female entrepreneurship.
Members recalled that women only accounted for 31 % of entrepreneurs (10.3 million) in the EU-28 in 2012, and only 34.4% of the
self-employed in the EU are women. Women are often only the officially registered owners of firms, for the sole purpose of securing financial
concessions and advantageous conditions from credit institutions and European, national and regional public administrations.
They noted in particular that the obstacles to female entrepreneurship are:
the predominance of women in unemployment,
the consistent gap in entrepreneurial activity,
the under-representation of women in management activities.
In this regard, Members called on Member States and regions to put forward concrete strategies to promote a culture of female
entrepreneurship, as well as different management and leadership styles and new ways of organising and managing companies.
Whilst stressing the need for gender-disaggregated data, including on various female entrepreneurship fields, Members called on the
Commission to incorporate the issue of womens entrepreneurship into its post-2015 strategy on equality between women and men.
Members called for a holistic approach to female entrepreneurship, aimed at encouraging and supporting women in building a career in
entrepreneurship.
Work-life balance: Members called on the Commission and the Member States to recognise the value of entrepreneurship for the work-life
balance of women and men, to eliminate barriers that hinder or even prevent female entrepreneurship, and to adopt a coherent framework of
measures to support female labour market participation.
In the aftermath of the decision to withdraw the proposal to amend the Maternity Leave Directive and in order to safeguard progress on
equality policies at EU level, Members encouraged a constructive dialogue among institutions to see how best to support and implement
work-life balance policies as well as concrete steps, including legislative proposals, for increasing the participation of women in the labour
market through measures to improve work-life balance.
The Commission and the Member States are called upon to:
implement the appropriate legislative and non-legislative actions on work-life balance;
establish policies enabling effective reconciliation of family- and work-related responsibilities.
Information and networks: Members emphasised the great importance of public spaces in helping to develop projects (providing visibility and
acting as incubators for companies) and providing financial and tax-related support, relevant and up-to-date information, and advice on starting
up a business, in particular for new female entrepreneurs.

They stressed the importance of funds for business consolidation. In this regard, Members considered that European networks of women
entrepreneurs should create a European and national network to facilitate and assist women in seeking financing and advice services for ease
of access.
The Commission is called upon to emphasise the use of forums in its upcoming European ePlatform for Women Entrepreneurship, and to
include a step-by-step plan for accessing European funding possibilities. It should also establish, with no impact on the Commission budget
and in the framework of the existing structure, a European Business Centre for women, in close cooperation with Member States and
companies from the private sector.
Access to funding: Members called on Member States governments, authorities and equality bodies (where they exist) to collaborate with the
financial sector regarding their obligation to ensure equality between men and women in access to capital for freelancers and SMEs.
They suggested to the Commission the introduction of gender quotas in all forms of targeted support provided to under-represented and
disadvantaged groups, in order to ensure progress towards achieving parity in entrepreneurship.
The Commission and the Member States should enhance the visibility of financing for entrepreneurial activity by drawing up aid maps for
microfinance, among other measures, under the European Progress Microfinance Facility.
Members also urged the Commission to address the specific challenges faced by women entrepreneurs in its next review and update of the
Small Business Act (SBA). They also called for greater monitoring to avoid the phenomenon of women being used by men as fronts in order to
secure financing on easier terms.
Entrepreneurial education and training: Members highlighted the importance of education at all levels, both formal and informal and including
lifelong learning, for boosting entrepreneurship and new business development, including in ICT, and especially in subject areas mostly
studied by girls, such as healthcare and other services. They called on the Member States to collaborate with the public sector, the private
sector, NGOs, universities and schools in order to establish more apprenticeships and non-formal and informal learning programmes and
suggested training in new information and communications technologies, social networks, online commerce, networking.
Members also noted with concern that women often underrate their skills, probably as a result of stereotypes and stressed that there is thus a
need for motivational and psychological support programmes to boost the self-confidence of female entrepreneurs.
Social entrepreneurship: lastly, Members stressed that alternative business models such as cooperatives and mutuals play an important role in
promoting gender equality and advancing sustainable and inclusive development and growth. They called on the Commission and the Member
States to facilitate and promote such alternative models.

2015/2111(INI) - 19/01/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 582 votes to 100, with 80 abstentions, a resolution on external factors that represent hurdles to
European female entrepreneurship.
Parliament recalled that women only accounted for 31 % of entrepreneurs (10.3 million) in the EU-28 in 2012, and only 34.4% of the
self-employed in the EU are women. Women are often only the officially registered owners of firms, for the sole purpose of securing financial
concessions and advantageous conditions from credit institutions and European, national and regional public administrations.
It noted in particular that the obstacles to female entrepreneurship are:
the predominance of women in unemployment,
the consistent gap in entrepreneurial activity,
the under-representation of women in management activities.
In this regard, Parliament called on Member States and regions to put forward concrete strategies to promote a culture of female
entrepreneurship, as well as different management and leadership styles and new ways of organising and managing companies.
It called on the Member States to collect at regional level gender-disaggregated data, including on various female entrepreneurship fields, in
order to acknowledge female entrepreneurs contribution in the social field, and recommended that data be collected and consolidated at
European level. It stated that particular attention should be paid to the experiences of women with multiple marginalised identities.
Whilst stressing the need for gender-disaggregated data, including on various female entrepreneurship fields, Parliament called on the
Commission to incorporate the issue of womens entrepreneurship into its post-2015 strategy on equality between women and men.
It called for a holistic approach to female entrepreneurship, aimed at encouraging and supporting women in building a career in

Access to funding: Parliament called on Member States governments, authorities and equality bodies (where they exist) to collaborate with the
financial sector regarding their obligation to ensure equality between men and women in access to capital for freelancers and SMEs.
The Commission is called upon to diligently monitor the implementation of gender mainstreaming in the allocation of EU funds in relation to
entrepreneurship. Parliament suggested to the Commission the introduction of gender quotas in all forms of targeted support provided to
under-represented and disadvantaged groups, in order to ensure progress towards achieving parity in entrepreneurship. The Commission and
the Member States are called upon to enhance the visibility of financing for entrepreneurial activity by drawing up aid maps for microfinance,
