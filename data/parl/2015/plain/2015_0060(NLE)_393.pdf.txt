2015/0060(NLE) - 05/03/2015 Initial legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude the Agreement between the European Union and Saint Lucia on the short-stay visa waiver.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council amended Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing
the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders of the Member States and those whose
nationals are exempt from that requirement.
The Regulation was adopted on 20 May 2014 and entered into force on 9 June 2014.
In July 2014, the Commission presented a Recommendation to the Council to authorise it to start negotiations on visa waiver agreements with
each of the following 17 countries: Dominica, Grenada, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the
Grenadines, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, the United Arab Emirates and Vanuatu. On 9
October 2014, the Council addressed negotiating directives to the Commission.

The negotiations on the visa waiver agreement with Saint Lucia and the four other Caribbean countries were opened on 12 November 2014 in
Brussels. The agreement was initialled by the chief negotiators on 11 December 2014. The Commission considers that the objectives set by
the Council in its negotiating directives were attained and that the draft visa waiver agreement is acceptable to the Union.
CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve the Agreement between the European Union and Saint Lucia on the short-stay
visa waiver.
The content of the agreement may be summarised as follows:
Purpose and duration of stay: the agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of Saint
Lucia when travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period. The agreement
takes into account the situation of the Member States that do not yet apply the Schengen acquis in full. As long as they are not part of the
Schengen area without internal borders, the visa waiver confers a right for the nationals of Saint Lucia to stay for 90 days in any 180-day on
the territory of each of those Member States (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania), independently of the period calculated for the whole
Schengen area.
A provision has been included in the agreement stating that Saint Lucia may suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all the
Member States of the European Union and that the Union may also only suspend or terminate the agreement in respect of all of its Member
States.
Scope: the visa waiver covers all categories of persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all
kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. For this latter category, each Member State and also Saint Lucia
remain free to impose the visa requirement on the citizens of the other Party in accordance with the applicable Union or national law.
The Member States and Saint Lucia reserve the right to refuse entry into and short stay in their territories if one or more of these conditions are
not met.
Territorial application: in the case of France and the Netherlands, the visa waiver would entitle nationals of Saint Lucia to stay only in those
Member States? European territories.
The provisions of the Agreement do not apply to the United Kingdom and Ireland.
The Agreement establishes a Joint Committee for the management of the Agreement, which shall adopt its rules of procedure.

2015/0060(NLE) - 28/04/2015 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude the Agreement between the European Union and Saint Lucia on the short-stay visa waiver.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: the Commission negotiated on behalf of the European Union an agreement with Saint Lucia on the short-stay visa waiver.
In accordance with a Council Decision, the Agreement has been signed and is applied on a provisional basis.
It is now necessary to approve the Agreement on behalf of the EU.
CONTENT: the Council is invited to approve the Agreement between the European Union and Saint Lucia on the short-stay visa waiver.
For further details of the Agreement, please refer to the summary of the initial Commission proposal dated 5.3.2015 .
Territorial provisions: the provisions of the future Agreement shall not apply to the United Kingdom and Ireland.
The Agreement sets up a Joint Committee of experts for the management of the Agreement. The Union is to be represented within that Joint
Committee by the Commission, which should be assisted by the representatives of the Member States.

2015/0060(NLE) - 16/11/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs adopted the report by Mariya GABRIEL (EPP, BG) on the draft Council decision on
the conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Agreement between the European Union and Saint Lucia on the short-stay visa
waiver.
The committee recommended the European Parliament to give its consent to the conclusion of the Agreement.
To recall, the Agreement signed on 28 May 2015 provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of
Saint Lucia when travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period. The visa
waiver covers all categories of persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all kinds of purposes,
except for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity.
The report is accompanied by a short justification stating that this Agreement on the waiver of short-stay visas simultaneously represents a
culmination of the deepening of relations between the European Union and Saint Lucia which is politically highly significant in the context of
the Cotonou Agreement and is an additional way of stepping up economic and cultural relations and intensifying political dialogue on various
issues, including human rights and fundamental freedoms.
In the economic sphere, Saint Lucia is a young country, with limited resources and a small population, which has nonetheless
succeeded in attaining or even exceeding some of the Millennium Development Goals, thereby attesting to its commitment to
fundamental rights. Although its economy is mainly based on farming, Saint Lucia is seeking to create an environment favourable to
investment and development of the private sector. The country is also increasingly trying to develop tourism, which is gradually

replacing its previously flourishing agriculture. This being so, this agreement will make it possible to step up relations further between
the two parties, to impart fresh impetus to trade and to dynamise tourism.
As regards the political and institutional situation, Saint Lucia is a stable, democratic country, which, like the European Union, defends
the values and principles of democracy, good governance and respect for human rights and the rule of law. The country has made
considerable progress with regard to gender equality, trafficking in persons and prostitution. The conclusion of this agreement will
make it possible to step up cooperation and intensify dialogue in many fields.
With regard to mobility, the visa refusal rate in 2014 being around 0.6%. Saint Lucia is therefore a country which does not present any
risks of clandestine immigration into the EU or any threat to security and public policy.
As regards the implementation and monitoring of the agreement, the rapporteur:
called on the Commission to observe any developments in relation to the criteria regarding clandestine immigration, public policy and
security, including, considerations relating to human rights and fundamental freedoms;
urged the Commission and the authorities of Saint Lucia to ensure full reciprocity of the visa waiver, which should permit equal
treatment of all citizens, particularly all citizens of the Union;
encouraged the Commission to review the composition of the joint management committees for future agreements to enable the
European Parliament to be involved in the work of these committees.
Lastly, the rapporteur also queried the practice of signing visa waiver agreements and applying them provisionally before the European
Parliament has approved them, a practice which is liable to reduce Parliaments room for manoeuvre.

2015/0060(NLE) - 15/12/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 584 votes to 66 with 24 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the draft Council decision on the

the Agreement.
The Agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of Saint Lucia when travelling to the
territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period. The visa waiver covers all categories of
persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of
carrying out a paid activity.
