2015/2272(INI) - 29/03/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on foreign Affairs adopted the own-initiative report by Sandra Kalniete (EPP, LV) on the EU in a changing global environment
a more connected, contested and complex world.
Members noted that the EU Global Strategy on foreign and security policy must define a political level of ambition for the EU as an
international actor. They stressed that the EU must recognise the full extent of the deterioration in its immediate strategic environment, and the
long-term consequences thereof. The fact that multiple crises were occurring simultaneously within the Union meant that no Member State
could respond alone and that Europeans should exercise their responsibilities collectively to ensure their security.
Defend the European Unions people, and its states, societies and values: the committee considered that the EU and its Member States should
rely less on the United States, especially in Europes neighbourhood, and step up their defence capabilities, in order to be prepared to respond
to the broad spectrum of civilian, military and hybrid threats and risks. The Union was urged to:
enhance cooperation on defence research, the industrial base and cyber defence through pooling and sharing and other cooperative
projects;
launch an EU-funded defence research and technology programme in the next multiannual financial framework (MFF);
strengthen the role of the European Defence Agency (EDA) and increase its resources;
strengthen EU-Nato cooperation.
Member States should:
commit to using at least 2 % of their GDP for defence expenditure by 2024 in order to attain the necessary and adequate civilian and
military capabilities to implement the objectives of the CFSP/CSDP;
take more responsibility for building urgently needed European capabilities, increase their military research expenditure through the
EDA and strengthen the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base and the European Defence Market.
ensure European intelligence exchanges are improved and a true European intelligence and forecasting capacity developed.
Stabilise Europes wider neighbourhood: Members felt that the EU should take greater responsibility on filling the security vacuum in its wider
neighbourhood, and should be more engaged in de-escalatory diplomacy, especially in the Southern Neighbourhood. They also felt that the
current refugee crisis demanded urgent concerted action, and called for a long-term strategy on asylum, migration and readmission policies
involving the reinforcement of the Schengen system, the European Border and Coast Guard and FRONTEX.
Strengthen multilateral global governance: the EU should aspire to be a rule-maker, contributing to efficient multilateral global governance with
the aim of strengthening democracy, good governance, the rule of law and human rights. The report stressed that the EU should:
develop synergies between security, development, trade, human rights, democracy promotion activities and EU external action;
establish closer relationships with non-state actors, local and regional governments and civil society, ensuring a comprehensive
approach to global challenges;
promote free and fair trade and investment, secure trade channels and increased market access throughout the world, and safeguard
the stability of the global financial system by promoting high standards of regulation and governance;
ensure that EU development policy is an essential part of the EU Global Strategy on Foreign and Security Policy;
Members called for a clear link between the EU Global Strategy and the structure and priorities of the EU budget, including enhanced own
resources, in order to allocate the necessary resources for its implementation.
Engage the EU, national parliaments and European citizens: Members felt that Parliament should play a key role in the regular, detailed
monitoring of the external action of the EU institutions and considered that the national parliaments could be more closely involved in this
monitoring exercise. European policy-makers should also engage with citizens, civil society, industry, and local and regional authorities. The
report stressed that the Global Strategy should be revised every five years, with the new European Parliament and the new Commission.

2015/2272(INI) - 13/04/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 427 votes to 232 with 43 abstentions a resolution on the EU in a changing global environment a more
connected, contested and complex world.
Members noted that the EU Global Strategy on foreign and security policy must define a political level of ambition for the EU as an

international actor. They stressed that the EU must recognise the full extent of the deterioration in its immediate strategic environment, and the
long-term consequences thereof. The fact that multiple crises were occurring simultaneously within the Union meant that no Member State
could respond alone and that Europeans should exercise their responsibilities collectively to ensure their security.
Defend the European Unions people, and its states, societies and values: Parliament felt that the EU has a key role in upholding the principles
enshrined in international human rights law, and that therefore, human rights must be meaningfully integrated into the new Global Strategy. EU
foreign policy must adopt a strategic approach to human rights, emphasising concrete actions and outcomes and demonstrating coherence in
the EUs engagement on human rights across different countries and regions, regardless of security, foreign policy, trade, energy, aid or other
concerns.
Parliament considered that the EU and its Member States should rely less on the United States, and be prepared to take greater responsibility
for their collective security and territorial defence, especially in Europes neighbourhood, They must step up their defence capabilities, in order
to be prepared to respond to the broad spectrum of civilian, military and hybrid threats and risks. The Union was urged to:
·

enhance cooperation on defence research, the industrial base and cyber defence through pooling and sharing and other cooperative
projects;

·

achieve the collective target of 2 % of defence spending on research;

·

launch an EU-funded defence research and technology programme in the next multiannual financial framework (MFF);

·

strengthen the role of the European Defence Agency (EDA) and increase its resources;

·

strengthen EU-Nato cooperation.

On the latter point, Parliament supported the establishment of European capabilities, which strengthen NATO in territorial defence and are
able to conduct intervention operations autonomously beyond the EUs borders. European members of NATO must actually live up to their
NATO commitments.
Member States should:
·

commit to using at least 2 % of their GDP for defence expenditure by 2024 in order to attain the necessary and adequate civilian and
military capabilities to implement the objectives of the CFSP/CSDP;

·

take more responsibility for building urgently needed European capabilities, increase their military research expenditure through the
EDA and strengthen the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base and the European Defence Market.

·

ensure European intelligence exchanges are improved and a true European intelligence and forecasting capacity developed.

Parliament called on the VP/HR to address the lack of clarity regarding the mutual defence clause contained in Article 42(7) TEU and to define
the guidelines and procedures for its implementation. With regard to the European Defence Agency, Parliament reiterated that the EDA should
be strengthened by financing its staffing and running costs from the Union budget. A principal objective should be to move towards
permanently pooled multinational military units, joint defence forces and the framing of a common defence policy which should ultimately lead
to a European Defence Union.
Stabilise Europes wider neighbourhood: Parliament felt that the EU should take greater responsibility on filling the security vacuum in its wider
neighbourhood, and should be more engaged in de-escalatory diplomacy, especially in the Southern Neighbourhood. It also felt that the
current refugee crisis demanded urgent concerted action, and called for a long-term strategy on asylum, migration and readmission policies
involving the reinforcement of the Schengen system, the European Border and Coast Guard and FRONTEX.
Strengthen multilateral global governance: the EU should aspire to be a rule-maker, contributing to efficient multilateral global governance with
the aim of strengthening democracy, good governance, the rule of law and human rights. Parliament stressed that the EU should:
·

develop synergies between security, development, trade, human rights, democracy promotion activities and EU external action;

·

establish closer relationships with non-state actors, local and regional governments and civil society, ensuring a comprehensive
approach to global challenges;

·

promote free and fair trade and investment, secure trade channels and increased market access throughout the world, and
safeguard the stability of the global financial system by promoting high standards of regulation and governance;

·

ensure that EU development policy is an essential part of the EU Global Strategy on Foreign and Security Policy.

resources, in order to allocate the necessary resources for its implementation.
