Summary

2015/3013(RSP) - 04/02/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a resolution tabled by the Committee on Regional Development on the role of local and regional authorities
in the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF). Recalling that the partnership and multilevel governance principles, as set out in

Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council, are among the core principles of the five ESI Funds, Parliament
stated that it was in favour of synergies and complementarity between the ESI Funds and other EU programmes, in which local and regional
authorities can play a useful role in attaining the objectives of cohesion policy.
Although local and regional authorities were consulted in most cases during the negotiations on the partnership agreements and operational
programmes, Members noted that their involvement did not amount to full partnership. They urged Member States, therefore, to fully comply
with the requirements flowing from the reinforced partnership principle and European Code of Conduct on Partnership, and increase efforts to
address deficiencies.
Parliament stressed that enhancing the administrative capacity and tackling the structural weaknesses of local and regional authorities are
pivotal to both the programming and the implementation phases of the operational programmes and to achieving a higher absorption rate of
ESI funds. The Commission was asked to ensure that support is provided for capacity building for local and regional authorities, especially in
the event of sub-delegation of implementation tasks to lower levels of administration, in particular urban authorities.
In the current programming period 2014-2020, Community-Led Local Development (CLLD) and local actions groups are also eligible for
financing under the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF). Parliament highlighted the
importance of the Community-Led Local Development initiative, in which local authorities are partners, and considered that the new Integrated
Territorial Investments (ITI) and CLLD initiatives represent step changes in the ability of local stakeholders to combine funding streams and
plan well-targeted local initiatives.
Convinced that urban areas play an increasing role in todays world, Parliament felt that the EU urban agenda can improve the development
and implementation of policies and programmes, thus ensuring a more coherent impact on, and support for, cities, while contributing towards
achieving common European and national objectives. It noted, however, that efforts to remove bottlenecks and inconsistencies should be
applied to EU policies impacting on urban and rural areas alike.
The Commission was asked to continue to build upon previous and ongoing initiatives, including public consultations, in order to identify
measures to strengthen the role of local and regional authorities in the management and implementation of the ESI Funds through the
partnership agreements and operational programmes.
