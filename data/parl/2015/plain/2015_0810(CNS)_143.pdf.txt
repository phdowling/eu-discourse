Summary

2015/0810(CNS) - 01/10/2015 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to approve the conclusion, by Eurojust, of the Agreement on Cooperation between Eurojust and Ukraine.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Implementing Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to
follow its opinion.
BACKGROUND: Decision 2002/187/JHA stipulates that Eurojust may conclude agreements with third States and organisations. Such
agreements may, in particular, concern the exchange of information, including personal data, and the secondment of liaison officers or liaison
magistrates to Eurojust. Such agreements may only be concluded after consultation by Eurojust with the Joint Supervisory Body concerning
the provisions on data protection and after the approval by the Council.
In order to strengthen its capacity to work with Ukraine, Eurojust has negotiated an Agreement on Cooperation between Eurojust and Ukraine.
Ukraine has ratified the Council of Europe Convention and its Additional Protocol regarding supervisory authorities and transborder data. The
Joint Supervisory Body of Eurojust gave a positive opinion on the provisions of the Agreement concerning data protection. The Agreement was
approved by the College of Eurojust on 10 March 2015.
CONTENT: in accordance with the draft implementing Decision, Eurojust is hereby authorised to conclude the Agreement on Cooperation
between Eurojust and Montenegro.
The Agreement contains provisions on the exchange of personal data.
Denmark, the United Kingdom and Ireland shall take part in the adoption and application of this Decision.

2015/0810(CNS) - 19/01/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs adopted, in the framework of a special legislative procedure (consultation of
Parliament), the report by Sylvia-Yvonne KAUFMANN (S&D, DE) on the draft Council implementing decision approving the conclusion by
Eurojust of the Agreement on Cooperation between Eurojust and Ukraine.
The committee recommended that Parliament approve the Council draft on cooperation between Eurojust and Ukraine with the aim to
enhancing judicial cooperation in the fight against serious crime in particular organised crime and terrorism. The draft agreement contains
provisions concerning the operational cooperation between Eurojust and Ukraine, such as the secondment of a liaison officer by Ukraine to
Eurojust and the exchange of information.
The explanatory statement accompanying the report recalled that the Joint Supervisory Body of Eurojust (JSB) has approved the draft
agreement and that all Eurojust amendments to the draft agreement have been taking into account (particularly on data protection).
Accordingly, the committee supports the conclusion of this cooperation agreement with Ukraine, since it would aid and reinforce the fight
against serious crime and would contribute to enhancing judicial co-operation, in particular in the field of organised crime and terrorism.

2015/0810(CNS) - 02/02/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 555 votes to 67, with 61 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the draft Council implementing decision

approving the conclusion by Eurojust of the Agreement on Cooperation between Eurojust and Ukraine.
Parliament approved the Council draft in the framework of the consultation procedure.
To recall, the draft agreement contains provisions concerning the operational cooperation between Eurojust and Ukraine, such as the
secondment of a liaison officer by Ukraine to Eurojust and the exchange of information. It seeks to aid and reinforce the fight against serious
crime and would contribute to enhancing judicial co-operation, in particular in the field of organised crime and terrorism.
