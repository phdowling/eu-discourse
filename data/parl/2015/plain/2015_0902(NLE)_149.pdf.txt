2015/0902(NLE) - 14/10/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament decided to approve by 454 votes to 130, with 64 abstentions, the appointment of Iliyana Tsanova for the position of
Deputy Managing Director of the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI).
To recall, Regulation (EU) 2015/1017 provides that the Managing Director and Deputy Managing Director of the EFSI are to be appointed by
the EIB after approval by the European Parliament following an open and transparent selection process in line with EIB procedures, during
which the European Parliament shall be kept duly informed in a timely manner at all stages.
On 2 October 2015, the Steering Board of the EFSI adopted a proposal for the appointment of the Managing Director and Deputy Managing
Director of the EFSI and transmitted this proposal to the European Parliament.
On 13 October 2015, the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs held a hearing with Iliyana Tsanova,
the proposed candidate for the function of Deputy Managing Director of the EFSI.
