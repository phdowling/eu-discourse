Summary

2015/2968(RSP) - 26/11/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a resolution on Afghanistan, in particular the killings in the province of Zabul.
The text adopted in plenary was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ECR, ALDE, Greens/EFA and EFDD groups.
Parliament strongly condemned the barbaric murder and beheading of seven Hazari people (two women, four men and a little girl) in the
south-eastern Afghan province of Zabul on the border with Pakistan. The killings in Zabul highlight the particular dangers faced by Hazaras,
which is considered to be the countrys third-largest ethnic group and the only one that is predominantly Shiit. The protection of the Hazara
community should be a priority for the Afghan Government.
Members also condemned the attacks by the Taliban, Al Qaeda, ISIL and other terrorist groups against Afghan civilians, the Afghan National
Defence and Security Forces, democratic institutions and civil society.
The resolution called for support for the Afghan authorities to take swift and appropriate action to ensure that the killers of innocent civilians are
brought to justice and to reaffirm the rule of law in the country.
Stressing that murders of civilians are serious violations of international humanitarian law, Members believe that murders of civilian hostages,
including women and children, must be treated as war crimes.
Whilst recalling that national security is an essential basis for social and economic development, political stability and the future of Afghanistan,
Parliament renewed its commitment to all efforts to rid Afghanistan of terrorism and extremism and believes such endeavours are vital for
regional and global security in order to build an inclusive, stable, democratic and more prosperous country. It called on the Member States and
the European External Action Service (EEAS) to remain fully engaged and to support the Afghan Government in the fight against the
insurgency. The Government of Afghanistan is called upon to intensify cooperation with the Government of Pakistan.
Parliament remains committed to supporting the Afghan Government in its efforts to undertake key reforms, to further improve governance and
the rule of law, to promote the respect of human rights, including womens rights, to fight corruption, to counter narcotics, to improve fiscal
sustainability and to foster inclusive economic growth.
The resolution reiterated that it is of the utmost urgency that the Afghan Government and all partners in the region engage credibly to end the
conflict and ensure a stable environment. It also reiterated that an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned peace process remains the prerequisite for
any sustainable and long-lasting solution.
In addition, Members welcomed the decision to hold the comprehensive Ministerial Conference on Afghanistan in Brussels in 2016 and
expects the Conference to set out the framework for the Government of Afghanistan and donors until 2020, underpinned by concrete
commitments by the Government of Afghanistan and the international community alike.
