2015/2330(INI) - 22/02/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs adopted the own-initiative report by Sofia RIBEIRO (EPP, PT) on European Semester for
economic policy coordination: Employment and Social Aspects in the Annual Growth Survey 2016.
Although the unemployment rate has been slowly diminishing since the second half of 2013, Members considered that this is not enough to
curb unemployment and poverty. Unemployment currently affects 9.9 % of active citizens, i.e. 23 million Europeans, about half of them being
long-term unemployed, with a figure over 10% in the euro area. The youth unemployment rate at EU level stands at 22.6% and employment
and social divergences within and between Member States persist.
In this context, the report made the following recommendations:
Investing in people: stressing that economic and social cohesion should remain the primary objective of all EU policies, Members called on the
Commission to:
take action to boost upward social convergence in the Union and define the concept of social fairness, taking into account both
employment and social policies, to be achieved through the 2016 AGS and the European Semester;
create quality employment and generating growth must be placed at the centre of Member State and EU policies, especially for youth
and for the Generation 55+;
foster forms of cooperation involving governments, enterprises, including social economy enterprises, educational institutions,
individualised services, civil society and social partners, on the basis of exchange of best practices and with a view to better matching
Member States' education and training systems to combat skills mismatches, meet the needs of the labour market;
promote a broader investment strategy for the full cycle of education and training , encompassing all sectors of lifelong learning,
work-based and workplace learning and formal and non-formal learning;
invest in people as early as possible in the life cycle in order to reduce inequality and foster social inclusion at a young age;
create a validation system for non-formal and informal forms of knowledge and experience, especially those acquired via voluntary
activities;
enhance the Youth Guarantee at national, regional and local level, and stress its importance for school-to-work transitions;
take account the problem of integration of the long-term unemployed and engage in strategies and actions to reduce poverty and
social exclusion.
Structural reforms in a social and responsible way: Members highlighted that socially responsible reforms must be based on solidarity,
integration, social justice and a fair distribution of wealth - a model that ensures equality and social protection, protects vulnerable groups and
improves living standards for all citizens.

The Commission and the Member States are called upon, inter alia, to:
promote and protect the social market economy;
increase their efforts to turn undeclared work into declared work and design measures to enable workers to move from the grey to the
formal economy;
implement measures to improve job quality in order to reduce labour market segmentation, combined with measures raising minimum
wages to an adequate level;
ensure that labour rights and social security standards are ensured when applying the flexicurity model and modernise their
employment protection legislation in order to promote more stability in employment and security in transitions between jobs;
embrace the shift towards the digital economy in the context of upskilling and training as well as new forms of employment;
gradually shift the tax burden from labour to other sources in a way that hampers neither the most vulnerable groups in society;
strengthen efforts to eradicate the gender pay gap.
The report also called on the European Semester and the AGS to assess the importance of incomes policies, including pensions, revenue
indicators and fiscal policy, in order to guarantee social cohesion and reverse inequality trends. In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity,
Member States should retain full responsibility for the organisation of their pension systems.
Boosting sustainable growth by relaunching investment: the report underlined the need to promote sustainable and inclusive growth leading to
the creation of more and better jobs and tangible prospects for all, including for young people. The Commission and the Member States
should:
focus on micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, as a fundamental key for sustainable and inclusive development;
take steps to provide better information on all European funds and programmes that have the potential to boost entrepreneurship,
investment and access to financing;
develop policies which boost entrepreneurship among young people from an early age, by providing opportunities for internships and
company visits;
reduce administrative burdens in order to support social enterprises.
Better use of European funds: the Commission should ensure that the EFSI enables a better social and economic convergence of Member
States and their regions within the EU and that all Member States make use of the possibility of accessing this fund. A report should be
published to audit and measure the economic and social impact of the investment concerned in real terms. Taking into account Member States
difficulties in fully using European funds, the Commission should ensure close monitoring of the use of EU funds.
Social inclusion: with 12.7% of working-age people suffering in-work poverty in 2014, the Commission should propose an integrated
anti-poverty strategy for the EU as well as an initiative to promote the introduction of minimum incomes in the Member States without
breaching the principle of subsidiarity.
Member States should also implement more effective and inclusive forms of social protection systems and income support. They should also
implement the necessary measures for the social inclusion of refugees, migrants legally residing in the EU and asylum seekers, in line with the
relevant asylum legislation.
Better coordination of the European Semester: warning about the possibility of development of a two-tier EU, Members believed that the euro
area recommendation needs to be the starting point to strengthen the social dimension in the sense of enhanced democratic accountability
mechanisms at both EU and national levels, including an interinstitutional agreement with the European Parliament and ensuring that all euro
area national parliaments have the conditions to follow each step of the European Semester process.
The Commission is called upon to present, as soon as possible, a proposal for establishing a Pillar on social rights capable of ensuring a level
playing field across the EU.

2015/2330(INI) - 25/02/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 404 votes to 201, with 35 abstentions, a resolution on European Semester for economic policy
coordination: Employment and Social Aspects in the Annual Growth Survey 2016.
Although the unemployment rate has been slowly diminishing since the second half of 2013, Members considered that this is not enough to
curb unemployment and poverty. Unemployment currently affects 9.9 % of active citizens, i.e. 23 million Europeans, about half of them being
long-term unemployed, with a figure over 10% in the euro area. The youth unemployment rate at EU level stands at 22.6% and employment
and social divergences within and between Member States persist.
In this context, Parliament made the following recommendations:
Investing in people: Parliament welcomed the fact that the Commissions Annual Growth Survey (AGS) underlined the need to pay more
attention to social fairness in the context of the new national stability and reform programmes, adding three employment indicators (activity
rate, youth unemployment and long-term unemployment) in for the macroeconomic imbalance procedure. It urged that these indicators be put
on a genuinely equal footing with the existing indicators.
Stressing that economic and social cohesion should remain the primary objective of all EU policies, Members called on the Commission to:
take action to boost upward social convergence in the Union and define the concept of social fairness, taking into account both
employment and social policies, to be achieved through the European Semester;
create quality employment and generating growth must be placed at the centre of Member State and EU policies, especially for youth
and for the Generation 55+;
foster forms of cooperation involving governments, enterprises, including social economy enterprises, educational institutions,
individualised services, civil society and social partners, on the basis of exchange of best practices and with a view to better matching
Member States' education and training systems to combat skills mismatches, meet the needs of the labour market;
embrace the shift towards the digital economy;
promote a broader investment strategy for the full cycle of education and training , encompassing all sectors of lifelong learning,

work-based and workplace learning and formal and non-formal learning;
invest in people as early as possible in the life cycle in order to reduce inequality and foster social inclusion at a young age;
create a validation system for non-formal and informal forms of knowledge and experience, especially those acquired via voluntary
activities;
enhance the Youth Guarantee at national, regional and local level, and stress its importance for school-to-work transitions;
take account the problem of integration of the long-term unemployed and engage in strategies and actions to reduce poverty and
social exclusion.
Structural reforms in a social and responsible way: Parliament is concerned at the social impact of those fiscal adjustment policies which focus
on cutting expenditure. It pointed out the need to continue prioritising public and private investment and socially and economically balanced
structural reforms that reduce inequalities.
It highlighted that socially responsible reforms must be based on solidarity, integration, social justice and a fair distribution of wealth - a model
that ensures equality and social protection, protects vulnerable groups and improves living standards for all citizens.
The Commission and the Member States are called upon, inter alia, to:
promote and protect the social market economy;
increase their efforts to turn undeclared work into declared work and design measures to enable workers to move from the grey to the
formal economy;
implement measures to improve job quality in order to reduce labour market segmentation, combined with measures raising minimum
wages to an adequate level and fighting in-work poverty;
encourage Member States to implement rates of taxation related to the degree of stability and the quality of the diverse forms of
employment relationship, as one of the incentives for stable contracts;
ensure that labour rights and social security standards are ensured when applying the flexicurity model and modernise their
employment protection legislation in order to promote more stability in employment and security in transitions between jobs;
embrace the shift towards the digital economy in the context of upskilling and training as well as new forms of employment;
gradually shift the tax burden from labour to other sources in a way that hampers neither the most vulnerable groups in society;
increase investment in their current social protection systems, if Europe wants to maintain its main competitive advantage in terms of
highly-skilled workers and productive companies;
strengthen efforts to eradicate the gender pay gap.
Parliament also called on the European Semester to assess the importance of incomes policies, including pensions, revenue indicators and
fiscal policy, in order to guarantee social cohesion and reverse inequality trends. In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, Member
States should retain full responsibility for the organisation of their pension systems and implement policies to guarantee a strong, sustainable
and adequate first pension pillar.
Boosting sustainable growth by relaunching investment: the resolution underlined the need to promote sustainable and inclusive growth
leading to the creation of more and better jobs and tangible prospects for all, including for young people. The Commission and the Member
States should:
focus on micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, as a fundamental key for sustainable and inclusive development;
take steps to provide better information on all European funds and programmes that have the potential to boost entrepreneurship,
investment and access to financing;
develop policies which boost entrepreneurship among young people from an early age, by providing opportunities for internships and
company visits;
reduce administrative burdens in order to support social enterprises.
The European Social Fund should devote more resources to funding the participation of unemployed workers in training programmes in the
EU Member States as well as in programmes in their country of origin.
Better use of European funds: the Commission should ensure that the European Fund for Social Inclusion (EFSI) enables a better social and
economic convergence of Member States and their regions within the EU and that all Member States make use of the possibility of accessing
this fund. A report should be published to audit and measure the economic and social impact of the investment concerned in real terms.
Taking into account Member States difficulties in fully using European funds, the Commission should ensure close monitoring of the use of EU
funds.
Social inclusion: with 12.7% of working-age people suffering in-work poverty in 2014, the Commission should propose an integrated
anti-poverty strategy for the EU as well as an initiative to promote the introduction of minimum incomes in the Member States without
breaching the principle of subsidiarity.
Member States should also implement more effective and inclusive forms of social protection systems and income support. They should also
implement the necessary measures for the social inclusion of refugees, migrants legally residing in the EU and asylum seekers, in line with the
relevant asylum legislation.
Parliament also called on the Commission and the Member States to reinforce their efforts to tackle social and wage dumping in the EU, which
causes significant harm to the workers affected and to Member State welfare systems.
Better coordination of the European Semester: warning about the possibility of development of a two-tier EU, Members believed that the euro
area recommendation needs to be the starting point to strengthen the social dimension in the sense of:
enhanced democratic accountability mechanisms at both EU and national levels, including an interinstitutional agreement with the
European Parliament and ensuring that all euro area national parliaments have the conditions to follow each step of the European
Semester process;
meetings of the euro area Labour and Social Ministers so as to better integrate its social dimension and properly address social
imbalances.
The Commission is called upon to present, as soon as possible, a proposal for establishing a Pillar on social rights capable of ensuring a level
playing field across the EU.
