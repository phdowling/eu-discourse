2015/2005(INI) - 29/07/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Transport and Tourism adopted an own-initiative report by Wim van de CAMP (EPP, NL) on the implementation of the 2011
White Paper on Transport: taking stock and the way forward towards sustainable mobility.
Implementation and mid-term review of the White Paper: the report welcomes the Commissions intention to carry out a mid-term review of the
White Paper. It called for the evaluation of the extent to which the list of actions set out in the White Paper is sufficient to achieve its
overarching goals, and to propose additional legislative measures. In particular, the Commission should:
propose, in line with Parliaments resolution of 5 February 2014, measures aimed at further reduction of transport emissions, in order
to help Member States reach the overall binding EU target of an at least 40% domestic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by
2030 compared to 1990;
propose a comprehensive strategy for the decarbonisation of transport that will allow the achievement of the long-term target of the
White Paper of an at least 60 % reduction of GHG emissions from transport by 2050.
Modal shift and co-modality: Members stressed that a European sustainable mobility policy needs to build on a broad range of policy tools to
shift towards the least polluting and most energy-efficient modes of transport in a cost-efficient manner. This is why they asked that European
transport policy should therefore be based on efficient co-modality, where the use of the most energy-efficient and sustainable transport
modes should be prioritised where possible.
Modern infrastructure and smart funding: the Commission is called on:
to submit proposals to provide for the internalisation of the external costs of all modes of freight and passenger transport (concrete
measures to ensure a wider application of the user pays and polluter pays principles) and for a level playing field to be ensured
between transport modes, abolishing environmentally harmful tax subsidies where appropriate, while maintaining the competitiveness
of all EU regions;
to propose a general framework for national road charging schemes for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles , which should
be non-discriminatory for third-country residents and prioritise distance-based charging. The revenue from infrastructure charges for
the building should be earmarked for the maintenance of safe transport infrastructure and the mitigation of transport-related
environmental problems.
Members considered that the completion of the Trans-European Transport Network remains one of the preconditions for a more sustainable,
efficient, seamless multimodal transport system and a more balanced distribution of freight and passengers among transport modes.
EU funding must reflect the real investment needs for completing the TEN-T core network by 2030. In this regard:

the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) instrument and other means of financing should stimulate investment in transport infrastructure
following the criteria set out in the TEN-T guidelines and CEF, giving priority to sustainable means of transport such as rail, inland
waterways and short sea shipping;
the financing of road infrastructure should be encouraged through various policies and instruments of the Union, particularly in the
cohesion countries;
the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) should give priority to sustainable transport and to infrastructure projects of vital
importance that deliver high societal, economic and environmental value.
Members reaffirmed their support for innovative financial instruments and stress the need for the rapid deployment of intelligent transport
systems to allow a more efficient, sustainable and safe use of vehicles and of the existing infrastructure.
Sustainable transport and urban mobility: stressing that improving energy efficiency should be one of the top priorities of the European
transport policy, Members called for:
promoting electro-mobility and electric public transport systems (electric buses (trolleybuses), electric cars), coupled with the
introduction of renewable energy sources in the electricity sector;
promoting the introduction of alternative fuels and propulsion systems;
setting a new goal of doubling public transport use in urban areas by 2030;
supporting the development and promotion of Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMPs);
support regional programmes for creating and expanding cycling networks in large European regions;
analysing the positive effects on society of new forms of mobility supported by the Sharing Economy model, including ride-sharing.
The Commission should require the Member States to provide conditions of fair competition between, on the one hand, shared transportation
companies (eg, Uber) and, on the other, traditional taxi and intercity transport companies, as regards compliance with tax legislation, safety,
public service obligations and employment conditions, etc.
Placing people at the heart of transport policy: with regard to road safety, a major social problem, the report calls for:
the adoption of a 2020 target of a 40% reduction in the number of people seriously injured as well as action to attain the road safety
target of less than 15000 fatalities in 2020;
actions to reduce accidents among vulnerable users, in particular users of two-wheeled vehicles, pedestrians in urban environments
and older drivers;
a review of the Professional Drivers Training and Qualification Directive;
a proposal to review the General Safety Regulation (661/2009) and the Pedestrian Protection Regulation (78/2009) by 2016;
establishing mandatory rules for heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) cab design and safety, direct vision, crash performance and pedestrian
protection;
improved safety measures for trucks and cars; building safer roads; developing intelligent vehicles;
strengthening driver licensing and training;
a harmonised EU blood alcohol concentration limit of 0.0 for new drivers in the first two years and for professional drivers.
The Commission should ensure that proposals on the opening-up of services in all transport markets go hand in hand with the proper
enforcement of EU social legislation and, where necessary, with support measures to avoid disparities between social conditions in the
different Member States.
A competitive, efficient, safe, integrated and interoperable transport system: emphasising that digitalisation is vital to improving the efficiency
and productivity of the transport sector, Members called on the Commission to put the integrated approach (interoperability, inter-connectivity
and intermodality) at the heart of the review of the White Paper. A European sustainable mobility policy must look at synergies between all
transport modes, corridors and networks.
In the area of aviation, Europe needs to maintain its direct connectivity to all parts of the world, providing direct flights by European carriers
from their hubs to overseas destinations and maintaining jobs and growth in the European aviation sector.
EU policy must ensure an efficient and competitive feeder network to strengthen European hubs by reducing costs to globally competitive
levels and ensuring fair competition with carriers from third countries.
Members considered that the EU Member States need a coherent and common policy in order not to further lose direct connectivity between
Europe, Asia and Africa to hubs in the Gulf and Turkey. They, therefore, asked the Commission, to implement these goals in all EU aviation
legislation and to apply them in negotiations with third countries.
The EU must maintain its leading role in the global efforts to reduce transport emissions in the framework of the 2015 Paris Climate
Conference (COP21).
The report finally makes a series of recommendations for the integration of all transport modes within the vision of a more efficient,
sustainable, competitive, accessible, user- and citizen-friendly transport system. It recommended, inter alia:
a revision of Regulation 868/2004 in order to safeguard fair competition in EU external aviation relations, completion of the internal
market for aviation, coherent and effective development of an EU airport network as well as all necessary actions by the Member
States to accelerate the implementation of the Single European Sky;
the completion of the Single European Railway Area through swift adoption of the 4th Railway Package, as well as the adoption by the
Commission, of a of a rail strategy proposing new measures to reach the 2030 and 2050 modal shift targets laid down in the White
Paper;
setting a global binding target in the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) to reach the objective of the White Paper for an at least
40 % reduction in CO2 emissions from maritime bunker fuels by 2050;
the establishment of an appropriate framework to optimise the internal market for inland waterway transport and to remove barriers
that prevent its increased use.

2015/2005(INI) - 09/09/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading

The European Parliament adopted by 599 votes to 80 with 16 abstentions, a resolution on the implementation of the 2011 White Paper on
Transport: taking stock and the way forward towards sustainable mobility.
Implementation and mid-term review of the White Paper: Parliament welcomes the Commissions intention to carry out a mid-term review of the
White Paper. The mid-term review should maintain at least the level of ambition of the goals set in 2011 and propose concrete measures to
increase efforts to meet them. The Commission should carry out an evaluation of the extent to which the list of actions set out in the White
Paper is sufficient to achieve its overarching goals, and to propose additional legislative measures. In particular, the Commission should:
propose, in line with Parliaments resolution of 5 February 2014, measures aimed at further reduction of transport emissions, in order
to help Member States reach the overall binding EU target of an at least 40% domestic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by
2030 compared to 1990;

prioritised where possible.
Modern infrastructure and smart funding: the Commission is called on:
to submit proposals to provide for the internalisation of the external costs of all modes of freight and passenger transport by applying a
common, coherent and transparent EU methodology and taking into account the specificity of each mode;
concrete measures to ensure a wider application of the user pays and polluter pays principles, including guidelines and best practices,
and for a level playing field to be ensured between transport modes, abolishing environmentally harmful tax subsidies where
appropriate, while maintaining the competitiveness of all EU regions;
to propose a general framework for national road charging schemes for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles , which should
be non-discriminatory for third-country residents and prioritise distance-based charging. The revenue from infrastructure charges for

supporting the development and promotion of Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMPs);
initiatives that motivate and enable users, especially young people, to use safer and more sustainable means of transport (walking,
cycling, including bike sharing and renting, public transport, car sharing, carpooling), which should be deployed within a safe
infrastructure
The Commission should require the Member States to provide conditions of fair competition between, on the one hand, shared transportation
companies (eg, Uber) and, on the other, traditional taxi and intercity transport companies, as regards compliance with tax legislation, safety,
public service obligations and employment conditions, etc.

a review of the Professional Drivers Training and Qualification Directive;
a review of Directive (EU) 2015/413 facilitating cross-border exchange of information on road-safety-related traffic offences, and
efforts to extend its application to the EUs neighbouring countries,
improved safety measures for trucks and cars; building safer roads; developing intelligent vehicles;
strengthening driver licensing and training;
a harmonised EU blood alcohol concentration limit of 0.0 for new drivers in the first two years and for professional drivers.

States to accelerate the implementation of the Single European Sky; enhancement of the negotiations within the International Civil
Aviation Organisation (ICAO) on the development of a global market-based mechanism addressing international aviation emissions
and a thorough review of their strategy and policies on aviation safety;
effective national policy frameworks aimed at the development of the market as regards the use of electric vehicles and alternative
fuels (electricity, hydrogen, natural gas (compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG)), liquefied petroleum gas
(LPG), synthetic and paraffinic fuels, and sustainable biofuels, and the rapid deployment of the necessary refuelling/recharging
infrastructure;
the completion of the Single European Railway Area through swift adoption of the 4th Railway Package, as well as the adoption by the
Commission, of a of a rail strategy proposing new measures to reach the 2030 and 2050 modal shift targets laid down in the White
