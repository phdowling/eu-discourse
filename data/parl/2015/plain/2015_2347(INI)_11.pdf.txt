2015/2347(INI) - 06/10/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Transport and Tourism adopted an own-initiative report by Tomasz Piotr POR?BA (ECR, PL) on improving the connection
and accessibility of the transport infrastructure in Central and Eastern Europe.
The report stressed the need to enhance the connectivity and accessibility of the infrastructure for transport to, from and within the central and
eastern parts of the EU, taking into account the needs of the economy and the principles of sustainable development.
Transversal aspects: the TEN-T objectives consist of bridging missing links, removing bottlenecks and ensuring seamless connections for
long-distance and regional transport, particularly in cross-border regions, for passengers and freight.
Members considered that the use of EU funding must reflect the real investment needs for completing the TEN-T core network by 2030 in the
region. Moreover, the EU should not only create new infrastructure but also invest in the modernisation and completion of existing transport
infrastructures.
Members welcomed the completion of the initial TEN-T core corridor work plans of 2015 and the adoption of the new maps further extending
the TEN-T network to the countries of the Western Balkans. They stressed that the implementation of the core network should also stimulate
the development of the comprehensive network, in particular for connections that have cross-border relevance and have an impact on the
consolidation of corridors.
The report also stressed the need to:
establish a new European corridor that links the Venice port hub directly with north-eastern Europe, by strengthening the current
TEN-T;
underline the importance of coordinated project planning by and among Member States;
improve coordination among European and national authorities, especially with regard to the realisation of the core part of the TEN-T
network while taking account of the specific challenges in the Member States;
make better use of existing policies and instruments for regional cooperation , such as European Territorial Cooperation (ETC),
Interreg and especially European Groupings of Territorial Cooperation (EGTCs), to enhance cross-border transport between regions
and remove bottlenecks;
develop transport hubs to be a key element for interlinking long-distance, regional and urban transport, thus promoting efficiency,
intermodality and regional business development;
ensure synergies and mutual complementarity of funding under the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF), the European Structural and
Investment Funds (ESI), the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance and instruments of the European Investment Bank and the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) when implementing transport infrastructure projects in the central and

eastern EU;
use the means of the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) in a timely manner to advance commercially viable
market-based projects;
use the ESI Funds to increase the administrative capacity of the intermediate bodies and beneficiaries;
pay attentions to east-west and north-south transport corridors within the European TEN-T network;
ensure the integration of the Western Balkans accession countries into the TEN-T network and the cooperation on transport links with
Ukraine, Moldova and other neighbouring countries.
Member States are encouraged to make use of public-private partnerships where appropriate, which can be an advantageous way of investing
in infrastructure, in particular as regards the implementation of complex infrastructure projects requiring extensive expenditure.
Moreover, cooperation under the macro-regional strategies of the EU, using innovative governance mechanism, could help to tackle transport
policy issues which cannot be solved by Member States individually.
Road transport: the Commission and the Member States are asked to address the urgent need to enhance the road infrastructure network
along the eastern border of the EU, starting in Estonia, passing through Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria
and ending in Greece.
Such efforts should build on the long-standing planning done already under the Via Carpatia project. Members considered that the possibility
of opening the Rhine-Danube corridor to the north of the EU through the Via Carpatia should be exploited and that Via Carpatia should receive
a proper budget allocation.
Member States are called upon to continue modernising roads, to continue developing missing links, to build safe and accessible parking lots
and to strengthen regional and local connectivity to the TEN-T network. Road safety should also be assessed when constructing road
infrastructure.
Rail transport: the report stressed the priority of constructing, modernising and maintaining railway lines for the coherent, sustainable growth of
rail transport and cohesion in the central and eastern parts of the EU. Members States are called upon to (re-)establish missing connections
and to remove bottlenecks. Members called on the Commission to continue supporting investment in rolling stock in Central and Eastern
European countries.
Members underlined the common benefits of the Rail Baltica link as one of the priority projects in the North Sea-Baltic Corridor and its
significant strategic importance for all the Member States involved, as well as for the whole region from Finland (with the possible Bothnian
extension), through Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and on to Germany, the Netherlands and southern Europe.
Inland waterways: the report highlighted the importance of inland waterway transport as a cost-effective and sustainable means for multimodal
transport and for logistics across the EU.
Members underscored the role of the Danube River as the key transport waterway in the Danube macro-region. They noted that the region's
potential for inland waterway transport ought to be further utilised and invited the riparian states to ensure the continuous navigability of the
Danube, while taking the environmental aspects into account.
Maritime ports and airports: the report underlined the potential for further developing attractive shipping to ports in the Baltic, Black, and
Adriatic Seas in the context of the Motorways of the Sea concept. It pointed out that sustainable port development in the Baltic, Adriatic and
Black Seas must not be impeded by other undersea infrastructure.
Northern Adriatic ports must strengthen their cooperation through regional coordination for the common promotion of traffic flows for maritime
trade in the North Adriatic and to fully integrate the Italian ports with those of Slovenia (Koper) and Croatia (Rijeka). The Commission is called
upon to include the port of Rijeka in the Baltic-Adriatic corridor in order to enable the full transport connection of northern Adriatic sea ports
towards Central Europe and the Baltic Sea.
The Commission should examine air connectivity in and between Member States and to establish measures to improve air transport services
in terms of quality of services for consumers.
Members noted the enormous potential that small and medium-sized airports have in terms of transport accessibility in Central and Eastern
Europe and stressed the contribution regional airports make to increasing the attractiveness of their regions.
Members maintained that for any new facilities, traffic demand and potential must be duly assessed and use of EU funds strictly limited to
economically viable and sustainable projects.

2015/2347(INI) - 25/10/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 532 votes to 142, with 16 abstentions, a resolution on improving the connection and accessibility of the
transport infrastructure in Central and Eastern Europe.
The resolution stressed the need to enhance the connectivity and accessibility of the infrastructure for transport to, from and within the central
and eastern parts of the EU, taking into account the needs of the economy and the principles of sustainable development.
Transversal aspects: Members considered that the use of EU funding must reflect the real investment needs for completing the TEN-T core
network by 2030 in the region. Moreover, the EU should not only create new infrastructure but also invest in the modernisation and completion
of existing transport infrastructures.
The implementation of the core network should also stimulate the development of the comprehensive network, in particular for connections
that have cross-border relevance.
Parliament recalled the Commission of its obligation under the 2011 White Paper on transport until 2020, to shift 30 % of road transport over
300 km to rail or waterborne transport by 2030, and more than 50 % by 2050, thereby significantly reducing traffic in Central and Eastern
Europe.
The resolution also stressed the need to:

coordinate project planning by and among Member States, taking into account as far as possible national master transport plans and
coordination with candidate countries, while conducting realistic assessments of transport needs, in line with the EU White Paper on
transport and including cost-benefit analysis and stakeholder consultation;
improve coordination among European and national authorities, especially with regard to the realisation of the core part of the TEN-T
network while taking account of the specific challenges in the Member States;
make better use of existing policies and instruments for regional cooperation , such as European Territorial Cooperation (ETC),
Interreg and especially European Groupings of Territorial Cooperation (EGTCs), to enhance cross-border transport between regions
and remove bottlenecks;
develop transport hubs to be a key element for interlinking long-distance, regional and urban transport, thus promoting efficiency,

Such efforts should build on the long-standing planning done already under the Via Carpatia project which should be incorporated into the
TEN-T core network in order to ensure appropriate EU funding. Members considered that the possibility of opening the Rhine-Danube corridor
to the north of the EU through the Via Carpatia should be exploited and that Via Carpatia should receive a proper budget allocation.
Rail transport: Parliament stressed the priority of constructing, modernising and maintaining railway lines for the coherent, sustainable growth
of rail transport and cohesion in the central and eastern parts of the EU.
It reiterated its support for the deployment of the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) on all TEN-T core network corridors.
Member States are called upon to adopt clear, long-term rail transport development strategies and to remove barriers to rail projects
implemented using EU funding.
Members underlined the common benefits of the Rail Baltica link as one of the priority projects in the North Sea-Baltic Corridor and its
significant strategic importance for all the Member States involved, as well as for the whole region from Finland (with the possible Bothnian
extension), through Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and on to Germany, the Netherlands and southern Europe.

Lastly, Members recognised the diverse roles of regional and local airports as well as the contribution regional airports make to increase the
attractiveness of their regions. For any new facilities, traffic demand and potential must be duly assessed and use of EU funds strictly limited to
economically viable and sustainable projects.
