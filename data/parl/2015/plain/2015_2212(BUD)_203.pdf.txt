2015/2212(BUD) - 07/08/2015 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: to mobilise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) to assist Italy following redundancies in its air transport sector.
PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
CONTENT: Article 12 of Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 laying down the multiannual financial framework for the years
2014-2020 provides that the EGF shall not exceed a maximum annual amount of EUR 150 million (2011 prices) over and above the relevant
headings of the financial framework.
The rules applicable to financial contributions from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) are laid down in Regulation (EU) No
1309/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (2014-2020) and repealing
Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006.
The Commission examined the application for mobilisation of the EGF to assist Italy and concluded the following:
Italy:EGF/2015/004 IT/Alitalia: on 24 March 2015, Italy submitted application EGF/2015/004 IT/Alitalia for a financial contribution from the EGF,
following redundancies in Gruppo Alitalia in Italy.
Italy submitted its application within 12 weeks of the date on which the intervention criteria set out in the EGF Regulation were met. The
deadline of 12 weeks of the receipt of the complete application within which the Commission should finalise its assessment of the application's
compliance with the conditions for providing a financial contribution expires on 11 August 2015.
In order to establish the link between the redundancies and major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation, Italy argues
that although globally, the international air transport market is still dominated by European airlines, this sector has undergone serious
economic disruption, in particular a decline of the EUs market share.
Europe grew by 3.8% in 2013 and 5.7% in 2014 compared to the previous year, below the world average (5.2% and 6.3% respectively), and
accounts for 38% of the world traffic (measured in RPK), one percentage point less than in 2012. The Middle East region remains the fastest
growing in the world, expanding by 10.9% in 2013 and 13.4% in 2014 and accounting for 14% of world international traffic.

The huge increase in the number of passengers carried from/to Italy by the Gulf carriers and Turkish airlines was made at the expense of
Alitalia. The decrease in the number of passengers transported in 2014 back to the figures in 2010, which represent a decline by 3.6%
compared to 2013 and by 6.4% compared with 2012 coupled with the losses accumulated since the full privatisation of Alitalia in 2009, which
in Q1 2014 were EUR 1 137 million are the events giving rise to these redundancies in Gruppo Alitalia for which Italy has requested the EGF
support.
Basis of the Italian application: Italy submitted the application under the intervention criteria of Article 4(1)(a) of the EGF Regulation, which
requires at least 500 workers being made redundant over a reference period of four months in an enterprise in a Member State, including
workers made redundant by suppliers and downstream producers and/or selfemployed persons whose activity has ceased.
The reference period of four months for the application runs from 31 August 2014 to 30 December 2014. During the reference period 1 247
workers were made redundant in Gruppo Alitalia.
In view of the Italian request, it is proposed to mobilise the EGF for the amount of EUR 1 414 848 to make a contribution to the package of
personalised services.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: having examined the application in respect of the conditions set out in Article 13(1) of the EGF Regulation, and
having taken into account the number of targeted beneficiaries, the proposed actions and the estimated costs, the Commission proposes to
mobilise the EGF for the amount of EUR 1 414 848, representing 60% of the total costs of the proposed actions, in order to provide a financial
contribution for the application.
The proposed decision to mobilise the EGF will be taken jointly by the European Parliament and the Council, as laid down in point 13 of the
Interinstitutional Agreement of 2 December 2013 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline,
on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management.
At the same time as it presents this proposal for a decision to mobilise the EGF, the Commission will present to the European Parliament and
to the Council a proposal for a transfer to the relevant budgetary line for the required amount.
At the same time as it adopts this proposal for a decision to mobilise the EGF, the Commission will adopt a decision on a financial contribution,
by means of an implementing act, which will enter into force on the date at which the European Parliament and the Council adopt the
proposed decision to mobilise the EGF.

2015/2212(BUD) - 30/09/2015 Budgetary report tabled for plenary, 1st reading
The Committee on Budgets adopted the report by Monika VANA (Greens/EFA, AT) on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament
and of the Council on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for an amount of EUR 1 414 848 in commitment and
payment appropriations in order to assist Italy following redundancies in its air transport sector.
Members recalled that the Union set up legislative and budgetary instruments to provide additional support to workers who are suffering from
the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns and to assist their reintegration into the labour market.
Italian application: Italy submitted application EGF/2015/004 IT/Alitalia for a financial contribution from the EGF following 1 249 redundancies
in Gruppo Alitalia, operating in the NACE Rev. 2 division 51 ('Ait transport') in the NUTS level 2 region of Lazio. Members noted that the
conditions set out in Article 4(1)(a) of the EGF Regulation are met. Therefore, Italy is entitled to a financial contribution of EUR 1 414 848
under that Regulation.
Nature of the redundancies: Members noted that the international air transport market has undergone serious economic disruption, in
particular a decline in the Unions market share and a huge increase in the number of passengers carried by Gulf and Turkish carriers that has
occurred at the expense of European companies such as Alitalia.
A package of personalised services: Members noted that the Italian authorities decided to initiate the implementation of the personalised
services to the affected workers on 1 April 2015, well ahead of the decision on the granting the EGF support for the proposed coordinated
package. Italy is planning five types of measures for redundant workers covered by this application: (i) intake and skill assessment, (ii) active
job search support, (iii) training, (iv) reimbursement of mobility costs, and (v) hiring benefits for over 50s.
The allowances and incentives are limited to mobility costs and hiring benefits and will stay below the allowed maximum amount of 35% of the
total costs for the coordinated package of personalised services, as set out in the EGF Regulation.
Members welcomed that the coordinated package of personalised services has been drawn up in consultation with the social partners, the
accredited agencies which provide job search support and the workers and that the accredited agencies providing active job-search support to
the workers are paid on the basis of the results achieved.
The Italian authorities confirmed that the eligible actions do not receive assistance from other Union financial instruments. In this regard,
Members reiterated their call to the Commission to present a comparative evaluation of those data in its annual reports in order to ensure full
respect for existing regulations and that no duplication of Union-funded services can occur.
Lastly, Members appreciated the improved procedure put in place by the Commission, following the Parliament's request for the accelerated
release of grants and noted the time pressure that the new timetable implies and the potential impact on the effectiveness of case instruction.

2015/2212(BUD) - 06/10/2015 Final act
PURPOSE: to mobilise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) to come to the aid of Italy following redundancies in its civil
aviation sector.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision (EU) 2015/1870 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the mobilisation of the European
Globalisation Adjustment Fund (application from Germany EGF/2015/004 IT/Ford Alitalia).

CONTENT: with this Decision, the European Parliament and Council decide to mobilise the sum of EUR 1 414 848 in commitment and
payment appropriations from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for the general budget for the financial year 2015.
This sum is intended to assist Germany following redundancies in Gruppo Alitalia in Italy.
Noting that the application complies with the requirements for determining a financial contribution from the EGF as laid down in Regulation
(EU) No 1309/2013 (EGF Regulation 2014-2020), Parliament and Council decided to respond by granting the above amount.
To recall, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund aims to provide support for workers made redundant and self-employed persons
whose activity has ceased as a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation, as a result of a continuation of
the global financial and economic crisis, or as a result of a new global financial and economic crisis, and to assist them with their reintegration
into the labour market.
The EGF is not to exceed a maximum annual amount of EUR 150 million as laid down in Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 20.10.2015. The Decision is applicable from 6.10.2015.

2015/2212(BUD) - 06/10/2015 Budgetary text adopted by Parliament
The European Parliament adopted by 605 votes to 77, with 12 abstentions, a resolution on the proposal for a decision of the European
Parliament and of the Council on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for an amount of EUR 1 414 848 in
commitment and payment appropriations in order to assist Italy following redundancies in its air transport sector.
Parliament recalled that the Union set up legislative and budgetary instruments to provide additional support to workers who are suffering from
the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns and to assist their reintegration into the labour market.
Italian application: Italy submitted application EGF/2015/004 IT/Alitalia for a financial contribution from the EGF following 1 249 redundancies
in Gruppo Alitalia, operating in the NACE Rev. 2 division 51 ('Ait transport') in the NUTS level 2 region of Lazio. Parliament noted that the
conditions set out in Article 4(1)(a) of the EGF Regulation are met. Therefore, Italy is entitled to a financial contribution under that Regulation.
Nature of the redundancies: Parliament noted that the international air transport market has undergone serious economic disruption, in
particular a decline in the Unions market share and a huge increase in the number of passengers carried by Gulf and Turkish carriers that has
occurred at the expense of European companies such as Alitalia.
The resolution stressed that, although employment in Lazio has been affected by the effects of the economic and financial crisis to a lesser
extent then employment at national level, each additional increase in unemployment puts the CIG benefit system under pressure.
A package of personalised services: Members noted that the Italian authorities decided to initiate the implementation of the personalised
services to the affected workers on 1 April 2015, well ahead of the decision on the granting the EGF support for the proposed coordinated
package.
Italy is planning five types of measures for redundant workers covered by this application:
intake and skill assessment,
active job search support,
training,
reimbursement of mobility costs, and
hiring benefits for over 50s.
The allowances and incentives are limited to mobility costs and hiring benefits and will stay below the allowed maximum amount of 35% of the
total costs for the coordinated package of personalised services, as set out in the EGF Regulation.
Parliament welcomed the focus on active job search and training measures proposed by the Italian authorities, including the re-employment
scheme targeting dismissed workers over 50 years of age.
Members also welcomed that the coordinated package of personalised services has been drawn up in consultation with the social partners,
the accredited agencies which provide job search support and the workers and that the accredited agencies providing active job-search
support to the workers are paid on the basis of the results achieved.
The Italian authorities confirmed that the eligible actions do not receive assistance from other Union financial instruments. In this regard,
Parliament reiterated its call to the Commission to present a comparative evaluation of those data in its annual reports in order to ensure full
respect for existing regulations and that no duplication of Union-funded services can occur.

release of grants and noted the time pressure that the new timetable implies and the potential impact on the effectiveness of case instruction.
