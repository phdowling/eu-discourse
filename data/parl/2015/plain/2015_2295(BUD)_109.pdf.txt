2015/2295(BUD) - 06/11/2015 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: to mobilise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in order to assist Ireland in dealing with redundancies in its
aviation maintenance sector.
PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
CONTENT: Article 12 of Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 laying down the multiannual financial framework for the years
2014-2020 provides that the EGF is not to exceed a maximum annual amount of EUR 150 million (2011 prices).
The rules applicable to financial contributions from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) are laid down in Regulation (EU) No
1309/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (2014-2020) and repealing
Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006.
In this context, the Commission has assessed the application for the mobilisation of the EGF in order to assist Finland, and has concluded as
follows:
Ireland: EGF/2015/006 IE/PWA International: on 19 June 2015, Ireland submitted application EGF/2015/006 IE/PWA International Ltd for a
financial contribution from the EGF, following redundancies in PWA International (PWAI) and one supplier in Ireland.
Ireland submitted its application within 12 weeks of the date on which the intervention criteria were met. The deadline expired on 6 November
2015.
In order to establish the link between the redundancies and major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation, Ireland
argues that the closure of PWAI, a Maintenance Repair and Overhaul (MRO) enterprise and a joint venture between United Technologies
Corporation's Pratt & Whitney (P&W) and Singapore Airlines Engineering Company (SIAEC), was made to consolidate the companys
operations in North America and Asia by the phased transfer from PWAI to other repair facilities within the P&W network, namely P&W PSD
based in Arkansas (USA) and Eagle Services Asia based in Singapore.

Over the past 10 years Asia-based customers have accounted for approximately 50 % of PWAIs business e.g. Japan Airlines (JAL), JAL
Aeroparts, All Nippon Airways (ANA) and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI). Another 40 % of PWAIs business has been with USA-based
customers, like United Airlines, and just 10 % with European customers e.g. SR Technics in Switzerland and Lufthansa in Germany.
Technological shifts towards new generation aircraft also help to explain the reduced demand for activity by PWAI at an Irish location and the
migration of such activity outside the EU. The future world aircraft fleet is likely to be dominated by single aisle / narrow-body aircraft typical of
Airbus 32. This growth is predicted to emanate from Asia, where the aviation sector is expanding and there is a requirement to replace older
aircraft types with narrow body types.
The trend towards locating MRO activity near centres of global aviation expansion, and the adverse impacts of global trade deals, has
seriously affected Europe and in particular Ireland. To date, the "repair and installation of machinery and equipment" sector has been the
subject of these three EGF applications, two of which based on trade related globalisation ( EGF/2014/0161E/ Lufthansa Technik and the
current application) and one (EGF/2009/021 IE/SR Technics) on the global financial and economic crisis.
The application relates to 108 workers made redundant in PWA International Ltd. and one supplier. The primary enterprise operated in the
economic sector classified under the NACE Revision 2 Division 33 (Repair and installation of machinery and equipment). The redundancies
made by the enterprises are mainly located in the NUTS5 level 2 region of Southern and Eastern (IE 02).
Eligibility of the Irish application: Ireland submitted the application under the intervention criteria of Article 4(2) derogating from the criteria of
Article 4(1)(a) of the EGF Regulation, which requires at least 500 workers being made redundant over a reference period of four months in an
enterprise in a Member State, including workers made redundant by suppliers and downstream producers.
The redundancies during the reference period are 61 workers made redundant by PWA International Ltd and 47 workers made redundant
before or after the reference period of four months. These workers were all made redundant after the general announcement of the projected
redundancies on 10 October 2013. The total number of eligible beneficiaries is therefore 108.
It is proposed to contribute to all personalised services the total of EUR 442 293.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: having examined the application in respect of the conditions set out in Article 13(1) of the EGF Regulation, and
having taken into account the number of targeted beneficiaries, the proposed actions and the estimated costs, the Commission proposes to
mobilise the EGF for the amount of EUR 442 293, representing 60 % of the total costs of the proposed actions, in order to provide a financial
contribution for the application.
The proposed decision to mobilise the EGF will be taken jointly by the European Parliament and the Council, as laid down in point 13 of the
Interinstitutional Agreement of 2 December 2013 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline,
on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management.
At the same time as it presents this proposal for a decision to mobilise the EGF, the Commission will present to the European Parliament and
to the Council a proposal for a transfer to the relevant budgetary line for the amount of EUR 442 293.
Furthermore, at the same time as it adopts this proposal for a decision to mobilise the EGF, the Commission will adopt a decision on a
financial contribution, by means of an implementing act, which will enter into force on the date on which the European Parliament and the
Council adopt the proposed decision to mobilise the EGF.

2015/2295(BUD) - 10/12/2015 Budgetary report tabled for plenary, 1st reading
The Committee on Budgets adopted the report by Victor NEGRESCU (S&D, RO) on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament
and of the Council on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, for an amount of EUR 442 293 in commitment and
payment appropriations in order to assist Ireland in dealing with redundancies in its aviation maintenance sector.
Members recalled that the Union set up legislative and budgetary instruments to provide additional support to workers who are suffering from
the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns or of the global financial and economic crisis and to assist their
reintegration into the labour market.
Irish application: Ireland submitted application EGF/2015/006 IE/PWA International for a financial contribution from the EGF following 108
redundancies in PWA International Ltd (PWAI), operating in the NACE Rev. 2 division 33 ('Repair and installation of machinery equipment') in
the NUTS level 2 region of Southern and Eastern Ireland. All redundant workers are expected to participate in the measures.
Given that the application does not fulfil the traditional eligibility criteria set down by the EGF Regulation in terms of number of redundancies
and is submitted under the intervention criteria of Article 4(2) of that Regulation, which allows for derogation under exceptional circumstances,
Ireland is entitled to a financial contribution under that Regulation.
Nature of the redundancies: Members noted that Ireland specialised in the Maintenance Repair and Overhaul (MRO) sector in the 1990's,
which served it well at that time, but made it particularly vulnerable to the recent trend to locate MRO activity near centres of global aviation
expansion, i.e. Asia. Members also noted that although the South Dublin unemployment rate (11.61 %) is only slightly higher than the national
average (10.83 %), these figures conceal pockets of considerable local disadvantage and that the closure of PWAI has had a serious impact
on employment and on the local, regional or national economy.
According to members, the EGF should be reformed to either clarify the derogation criteria set out in Article 4(1) of the EGF Regulation, or
lower the threshold of 500 workers being made redundant.
A package of personalised services: Members welcomed the fact that, in order to provide workers with speedy assistance, the Irish authorities
decided to initiate the implementation of the personalised services to the affected workers on 22 May 2015, well ahead of the decision on the
granting of EGF support for the proposed coordinated package. They noted that Ireland is planning five types of measures for redundant
workers covered by this application:
1. guidance and career planning and development,
2. EGF Training Grants,
3. Training and Further Education Programmes,
4.

4. Higher Education Programmes,
5. Time Limited Allowances.
They noted that 24.81% of the costs will be used for time limited allowances, which remains much below the maximum allowed 35% of all
costs.
They recalled the importance of improving the employability of all workers by means of adapted training and the recognition of skills and
competences gained throughout a worker's professional career. Members expected the training on offer in the coordinated package to be
adapted not only to the needs of the dismissed workers but also to the actual business environment.
They also noted that the Irish authorities confirm that the eligible actions do not receive assistance from other Union financial instruments.
Smallest number of laid off workers: Members regretted that the EGF mobilisation is proposed for only 108 redundant employees. They
observed that this proposal aims to mobilise the EGF with effectively the smallest number of laid off workers proposed so far. Lastly, Members
pointed out that all 108 redundancies are in the economic sector classified as "repair and installation of machinery and equipment", and more
specifically aviation jet engines, which renders the workers skilled and adaptable to the labour market.

2015/2295(BUD) - 16/12/2015 Budgetary text adopted by Parliament
The European Parliament adopted by 580 votes to 100, with 11 abstentions, a resolution on the proposal for a decision of the European
Parliament and of the Council on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, for an amount of EUR 442 293 in
commitment and payment appropriations in order to assist Ireland in dealing with redundancies in its aviation maintenance sector.
Parliament recalled that the Union set up legislative and budgetary instruments to provide additional support to workers who are suffering from
the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns or of the global financial and economic crisis and to assist their
reintegration into the labour market.
Irish application: Ireland submitted application EGF/2015/006 IE/PWA International for a financial contribution from the EGF following 108
redundancies in PWA International Ltd (PWAI), operating in the NACE Rev. 2 division 33 ('Repair and installation of machinery equipment') in
the NUTS level 2 region of Southern and Eastern Ireland. All redundant workers are expected to participate in the measures.
Given that the application does not fulfil the traditional eligibility criteria set down by the EGF Regulation in terms of number of redundancies
and is submitted under the intervention criteria of Article 4(2) of that Regulation, which allows for derogation under exceptional circumstances,
Ireland is entitled to a financial contribution under that Regulation.
Nature of the redundancies: Parliament noted that Ireland specialised in the Maintenance Repair and Overhaul (MRO) sector in the 1990's,
which served it well at that time, but made it particularly vulnerable to the recent trend to locate MRO activity near centres of global aviation
expansion, i.e. Asia. Members also noted that the situation in South Dublin is worrying given that the closure of PWAI has had a serious
impact on employment and on the local, regional or national economy.
Clarify the ceiling of EGF for exceptional circumstances: Parliament agreed that the pre-existing difficult situation in the area, combined with
the cumulative effect of three major closures in the MRO sector within a short period, and the fact that no employers in this sector remain in
Ireland may justify a derogation from the threshold of 500 redundancies set out in article 4(1) of the EGF regulation. It reiterated, in this regard,
its recommendation to the Commission to either clarify the derogation criteria set out in Article 4(1) of the EGF Regulation, or lower the
threshold of 500 workers being made redundancies.
A package of personalised services: Parliament welcomed the fact that, in order to provide workers with speedy assistance, the Irish

2015/2295(BUD) - 16/12/2015 Final act
PURPOSE: to mobilise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in order to assist Ireland in dealing with redundancies in its
aviation maintenance sector.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision (EU) 2015/2458 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the mobilisation of the European
Globalisation Adjustment Fund (application from Ireland EGF/2015/006 IE/PWA International).

CONTENT: with this Decision, the European Parliament and the Council have decided to mobilise the sum of EUR 442 293 in commitment
and payment appropriations from European Globalisation Adjustment Fund within the framework of the 2015 budget.
This amount aims to obtain a financial contribution from the EGF following redundancies in PWA International Ltd and one supplier in Ireland.
Given that this application complies with the requirements for determining the financial contributions as laid down in Regulation No 1309/2013
(EGF Regulation 2014-2020), the European Parliament and Council have decided to grant the above-mentioned amount.
The application was considered admissible since the redundancies have a serious impact on employment and the local, regional or national
economy. Ireland has also decided to provide personalised services co-financed by the EGF also to 108 young persons not in employment,
education or training (NEETs).
To recall, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) aims to provide support for workers made redundant and self-employed persons
whose activity has ceased as a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation, as a result of a continuation of
the global financial and economic crisis, or as a result of a new global financial and economic crisis, and to assist them with their reintegration
into the labour market.
Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 laying down the multiannual financial framework for the years 2014-2020, allows mobilization
of the EGF upto a maximum annual amount of EUR 150 million.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 16.12.2015.
