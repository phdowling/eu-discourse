2015/2056(BUD) - 23/02/2015 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: to mobilise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) to assist France following redundancies in its transport services.
PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
CONTENT: Article 12 of Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 laying down the multiannual financial framework for the years
2014-2020 provides that the EGF shall not exceed a maximum annual amount of EUR 150 million (2011 prices) over and above the relevant
headings of the financial framework.
The rules applicable to financial contributions from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) are laid down in Regulation (EU) No
1309/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (2014-2020) and repealing
Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 (the 'EGF Regulation').
In this context, the Commission examined the application for mobilisation of the EGF to assist France and concluded the following:
France:EGF/2014/017 FR/Mory-Ducros: the French authorities submitted application EGF/2014/017 FR/Mory-Ducros for a financial
contribution from the EGF, following redundancies in Mory-Ducros SAS in France.
The French authorities submitted the application within 12 weeks of the date on which the intervention criteria set out below were met. The
deadline expired on 23 February 2015.
In order to establish the link between the redundancies and the global financial and economic crisis addressed in Regulation (EC) No
546/2009, France argued that Mory-Ducros is active in the fields of courier services, freight transport and delivery, warehousing and rental of
related materials, and provided these services both within France and abroad.
As a result of the global financial and economic crisis, road haulage in vehicles weighing more than 3.5 tonnes declined by 13.7% in the EU

and by 21% in France between 2007 and 2012 (Eurostat). This decline has been following the general decline of physical output in Europe.
Faced with the reduction in volumes to be transported, a price war broke out within the sector. This has been followed by a wave of
bankruptcies in the road haulage sector, estimated to have increased by 35% annually when comparing 2013 with 2007.
To date, the 'Land transport and transport via pipelines' sector has been the subject of two EGF applications, this one and EGF/2011/001
AT/Nieder- und Oberoesterreich.
Basis of the French application: the French authorities submitted the application under the intervention criteria of Article 4(1)(a) of the EGF
Regulation, which requires at least 500 workers being made redundant or self-employed persons' activity ceasing, over a reference period
from 13 March 2014 to 12 July 2014, including workers made redundant by suppliers and downstream producers and/or self-employed
persons whose activity has ceased.
The application relates to 2 513 workers made redundant in Mory-Ducros SAS which operated in the economic sector classified under NACE
Rev. 2 division 49 ('Land transport and transport via pipelines'). The redundancies made by the enterprise concerned are located throughout
mainland France. The location with the highest number (257) is situated in the NUTS level 2 region of Ile de France.
The Commission therefore proposes to mobilise the EGF for the amount of EUR 6 052 200.
FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: having examined the application in respect of the conditions set out in Article 13(1) of the EGF Regulation, and
having taken into account the number of targeted beneficiaries, the proposed actions and the estimated costs, the Commission proposes to
mobilise the EGF for the amount of EUR 6 052 200, representing 60% of the total costs of the proposed actions, in order to provide a financial
contribution for the application.
The proposed decision to mobilise the EGF will be taken jointly by the European Parliament and the Council, as laid down in point 13 of the
Interinstitutional Agreement of 2 December 2013 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline,
on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management.
At the same time as it presents this proposal for a decision to mobilise the EGF, the Commission will present a proposal for a transfer to the
relevant budgetary line for the amount requested.
At the same time as it adopts this proposal for a decision to mobilise the EGF, the Commission will adopt a decision on a financial contribution,
by means of an implementing act, which will enter into force on the date at which the European Parliament and the Council adopt the
proposed decision to mobilise the EGF.

2015/2056(BUD) - 01/04/2015 Budgetary report tabled for plenary, 1st reading
The Committee on Budgets adopted the report by Jean-Paul DENANOT (S&D, FR) on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament
and of the Council on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, in the amount of EUR 6 052 200 in commitment and
payment appropriations in order to assist France which has been affected by redundancies in the transport sector.
Members recalled that the Union had set up legislative and budgetary instruments to provide additional support to workers who were suffering
from the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns or of the global financial and economic crisis and to assist their
reintegration into the labour market.
Frances application: France submitted application EGF/2014/017 FR/Mory-Ducros for a financial contribution from the EGF, following 2513
redundancies in Mory-Ducros SAS operating in the NACE Rev. 2 division 49 ('Land transport and transport via pipelines'). France was entitled
to a financial contribution under that Regulation.
Members welcomed the fact that, in order to provide workers with speedy assistance, the French authorities decided to initiate the
implementation of the personalised services to the affected workers on 24 February 2014, well ahead of the decision and even the application
on the granting the EGF support for the proposed coordinated package.
Nature of redundancies: Members observed that the redundancies in Mory-Ducros SAS were linked to the general decline in physical output in
Europe, which lead to a the reduction in volumes to be transported and triggered a price war in the road haulage sector, resulting in a steady
deterioration in operating margins and a series of losses for the sector in France since 2007. This was followed by a wave of bankruptcies,
including that of Mory-Ducros. Those events were directly linked to the global financial and economic crisis.
Members underlined that over 17 % of the beneficiaries expected to be targeted by the proposed actions were in the 55-64 age group and that
their participation in the proposed support measures would help them to avoid long-term unemployment and social exclusion.
Personalised services: Members noted that the personalised services to be provided consisted of only one action to be implemented by a
one-stop-shop, which was run by three contracting agencies. France requested only the funding of this one-stop-shop from the EGF. Members
noted that the task of the contractors was to assist and guide the redundant workers and help them find solutions enabling them to remain in
the labour market and start new jobs.
Members considered that workers in the 55-64 age group were at a higher risk of prolonged unemployment and exclusion from the labour
market. These workers had specific needs when it came to providing them with a personalised approach. Members recalled that the design of
the coordinated package of personalised services should anticipate future labour market perspectives and required skills and should be
compatible with the shift towards a resource-efficient and sustainable economy.
They noted that the information provided on the coordinated package of personalised services to be funded from the EGF included information
on complementarity with actions funded by the Structural Funds. The French authorities confirmed that the eligible actions did not receive
assistance from other Union financial instruments.
Lastly, Members called on the Commission to present a comparative evaluation of those data in its annual reports in order to ensure full
respect of the existing regulations and that no duplication of Union-funded services could occur.

2015/2056(BUD) - 15/04/2015 Budgetary text adopted by Parliament

The European Parliament adopted by 535 votes to 79 with 9 abstentions, a resolution on the proposal for a decision of the European
Parliament and of the Council on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, amounting to EUR 6 052 200 in
commitment appropriations in order to assist France which has been affected by redundancies in the transport sector.
Parliament recalled that the Union had set up legislative and budgetary instruments to provide additional support to workers who were
suffering from the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns or of the global financial and economic crisis and to assist
their reintegration into the labour market.
Frances application: France submitted application EGF/2014/017 FR/Mory-Ducros for a financial contribution from the EGF, following 2513
redundancies in Mory-Ducros SAS operating in the NACE Rev. 2 division 49 ('Land transport and transport via pipelines'). France was entitled
to a financial contribution under that Regulation.
Parliament welcomed the fact that, in order to provide workers with speedy assistance, the French authorities decided to initiate the
implementation of the personalised services to the affected workers on 24 February 2014, well ahead of the decision and even the application
on the granting the EGF support for the proposed coordinated package.
Nature of redundancies: Parliament observed that the redundancies in Mory-Ducros SAS were linked to the general decline in physical output
in Europe, which lead to a the reduction in volumes to be transported and triggered a price war in the road haulage sector, resulting in a
steady deterioration in operating margins and a series of losses for the sector in France since 2007. This was followed by a wave of

Members underlined that over 17 % of the beneficiaries expected to be targeted by the proposed actions were in the 55-64 age group and that
their participation in the proposed support measures would help them to avoid long-term unemployment and social exclusion.
Personalised services: Parliament noted that the personalised services to be provided consisted of only one action to be implemented by a
one-stop-shop, which was run by three contracting agencies. France requested only the funding of this one-stop-shop from the EGF.
Contracting agencies: Parliament noted that the task of the contractors was to assist and guide the redundant workers and help them find
solutions enabling them to remain in the labour market and start new jobs. The three contractors operating the Cellule de reclassement were
selected by the judicial administrator following consultations with the representatives of the redundant workers. The monitoring of the activity of
the agencies by means of regular written reports ensured the appropriate use of the EGF funding to provide participants with a personalised
career path, a sufficient number of job offers and mentoring for business creation within the framework of the one-stop-shop system.
Parliament recalled that EGF funding was intended to help the workers find new employment through training and not in any case to support
the agencies and their administrative costs. It also recalled that the design of the coordinated package of personalised services should
anticipate future labour market perspectives and required skills and should be compatible with the shift towards a resource-efficient and
sustainable economy.
Older workers: Parliament considered that workers in the 55-64 age group were at a higher risk of prolonged unemployment and exclusion
from the labour market. These workers had specific needs when it came to providing them with a personalised approach. Members noted that
the information provided on the coordinated package of personalised services to be funded from the EGF included information on
complementarity with actions funded by the Structural Funds. The French authorities confirmed that the eligible actions did not receive
assistance from other Union financial instruments.
Parliament reiterated its call to the Commission to present a comparative evaluation of those data in its annual reports in order to ensure full
respect of the existing regulations and that no duplication of Union-funded services could occur.

2015/2056(BUD) - 29/04/2015 Final act
PURPOSE: to mobilise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) to assist France following redundancies in its transport services.
NON LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision (EU) 2015/738 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the mobilisation of the European
Globalisation Adjustment Fund (application EGF/2014/017 FR/Mory-Ducros, from France)
CONTENT: with this Decision, the European Parliament and Council decide that, for the general budget of the European Union for the
financial year 2015, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund shall be mobilised to provide the sum of EUR 6 052 200 in commitment and
payment appropriations.
This amount is intended to assist France, which has been affected by redundancies in the transport sector at Mory-Ducros SAS.
Noting that the French application complies with the requirements for determining a financial contribution from the EGF as laid down in
Regulation (EU) No 1309/2013 (EGF Regulation 2014-2020) Parliament and Council decided to grant the amount requested.
To recall, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund was established to provide support for workers made redundant and self-employed
persons whose activity has ceased as a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation, as a result of a
continuation of the global financial and economic crisis addressed in Regulation (EC) No 546/2009 of the European Parliament and of the
Council, or as a result of a new global financial and economic crisis and to assist them with their reintegration into the labour market.
Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 allows the mobilisation of the EGF within a maximum annual amount of EUR 150 million.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 29.04.2015.
