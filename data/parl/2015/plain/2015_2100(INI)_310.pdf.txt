2015/2100(INI) - 22/06/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Fisheries adopted the report by Peter Van DALEN (ECR, NL) containing a motion for a non-legislative resolution on the
draft Council decision on the conclusion of the Protocol between the European Union and the Republic of Cape Verde setting out the fishing
opportunities and the financial contribution provided for in the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and this country.
Members recalled that the general aim of the Protocol is to enhance cooperation between the European Union and the Republic of Cape
Verde, thereby creating a partnership framework within which to develop a sustainable fisheries policy and sound exploitation of fishery
resources in the fishing zone of this country.
Noting that both parties are committed to fully respecting all recommendations made by the International Commission for the Conservation of
Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), Members stressed that the new monitoring mechanism, linked with thresholds of 30 % and 40 % of shark catches
which trigger additional measures, is, in particular, a step in the right direction.
Members also noted that some shark species (particularly blue shark and shortfin mako, which represent 99% of total catches) listed in Annex
1 to the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea are main species targeted by the EU surface long-line fleet and that the
Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (SCRS) of ICCAT considers that they are exploited within safe biological limits.
The Commission is called upon to report to Parliament on the actions taken by the Joint Committee in response to the science-based study to
be carried out as described in Article 4, paragraph 6 of the Annex to the Protocol, in order to have guarantees that this fishery is exploited in a
sustainable and responsible way.
Members welcomed this new fisheries protocol between the European Union and the Republic of Cape Verde, adopted in accordance with the
sustainability measures of the new common fisheries policy (CFP).
Member called for the application of transparent measures as regards the implementation of the Protocol. They called on the Commission to:
forward to Parliament the minutes and conclusions of the meetings of the Joint Committee provided for in the Fisheries Partnership
Agreement;
submit to Parliament and the Council, within the last year of application of the protocol and before the opening of negotiations for its
renewal, a full report on its implementation;
keep Parliament immediately and fully informed at all stages of the procedures related to the protocol and its renewal;
communicate annually with Parliament on the additional international agreements of Cape Verde so that Parliament may monitor all
fishing activities in the region, including those that may be contrary to European fisheries policy, for example, shark finning.

2015/2100(INI) - 09/09/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 605 votes to 57, with 26 abstentions, a resolution on the draft Council decision on the conclusion of the
Protocol between the European Union and Cape Verde setting out the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for in the
Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and this country.
Parliament recalled that the general aim of the Protocol is to enhance cooperation between the European Union and the Republic of Cape
Verde, thereby creating a partnership framework within which to develop a sustainable fisheries policy and sound exploitation of fishery
resources in the fishing zone of this country.
Shark catches: noting that both parties are committed to fully respecting all recommendations made by the International Commission for the
Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), Parliament stressed that the new monitoring mechanism, linked with thresholds of 30% and 40% of
shark catches which trigger additional measures, is, in particular, a step in the right direction.
Concerned that there was a significant increase in the catch of shark species during the final years of the previous Protocol, plenary called on
the Commission to report to Parliament on the actions taken by the Joint Committee in response to the science-based study to be carried out
as described in Article 4, paragraph 6 of the Annex to the Protocol, in order to have guarantees that this fishery is exploited in a sustainable
and responsible way.
It also stressed that Parliament should also be informed about the data obtained as regards shark stocks.
At the same time, Members welcomed this new fisheries protocol between the European Union and the Republic of Cape Verde, adopted in
accordance with the sustainability measures of the new common fisheries policy (CFP).
Parliament called for the application of transparent measures as regards the implementation of the Protocol. They called on the Commission
to:
forward to Parliament the minutes and conclusions of the meetings of the Joint Committee provided for in the Fisheries Partnership
Agreement;
submit to Parliament and the Council, within the last year of application of the protocol and before the opening of negotiations for its
renewal, a full report on its implementation;
keep Parliament immediately and fully informed at all stages of the procedures related to the protocol and its renewal;
communicate annually with Parliament on the additional international agreements of Cape Verde so that Parliament may monitor all

fishing activities in the region, including those that may be contrary to European fisheries policy, for example, shark finning.
