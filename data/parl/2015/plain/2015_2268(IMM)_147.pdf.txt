Summary

2015/2268(IMM) - 13/01/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Legal Affairs unanimously adopted the report by Heidi HAUTALA (Greens/EFA, FI) in which it recommended Parliament to
waive the immunity of Czes?aw Adam SIEKIERSKI (EPP, PL).
Members recalled that the Prosecutor-General of Poland forwarded to the President of Parliament a request made by the Polish General

Inspectorate of Road Traffic to grant authorisation to take legal action against a Member of the European Parliament, Czes?aw Adam
Siekierski, in connection with a speeding offence. It is claimed that on 19 April 2015, in the town of Stopnica, Czes?aw Adam Siekierski was
recorded by a speed camera driving a car at 79 km/h in an area with a 50 km/h speed limit.
From the circumstances of the case it appears that the alleged offence and the ensuing prosecution clearly have nothing to do with the
position of Czes?aw Adam Siekierski as a Member of the European Parliament and that there is no evidence of fumus persecutionis (a
sufficiently serious and precise suspicion that the matter is being brought before a court with the intention of causing political damage to the
Member concerned).
Therefore, the committee on Legal Affairs recommended the European Parliament to waive the parliamentary immunity of Czes?aw Adam
Siekierski.
