2015/0295(COD) - 16/12/2015 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to extend the period during which commodity dealers are exempted from certain requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) nº
575/2013 on capital requirements (the 'Capital Requirements Regulation' or 'CRR').
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.

BACKGROUND: Articles 493(1) and 498(1) of Regulation (EU) nº 575/2013 (CRR) exempt commodity dealers from large exposures
requirements and from own funds requirements respectively. Both exemptions expire on 31 December 2017. This 'sunset clause' was
originally included in the CRR in order to allow time for regulators to determine a prudential regulation adapted to the risk profile of commodity
dealers. To this end, the CRR mandates the Commission to prepare reports by the end of 2015. On the basis of those reports, the
Commission may decide to submit proposals to amend the CRR.
The prudential framework applicable to investment firms (including commodity dealers) laid down in the CRR and Directive 2013/36/EC (the
Capital Requirements Directive) is currently under review. The results will determine the appropriate prudential treatment of commodity
dealers. The investment firms review is a complex project. The finalisation of the review and the adoption of new legislation that may be
required in light of that review will be concluded only after 31 December 2017.
It is therefore highly improbable that any legislation that may result from this review can be prepared, adopted and applied before the current
exemptions expire. This has implications for commodity dealers: if no specific prudential framework that may result from the investment firm
review would be in place by then, they would be subject to the full CRR/CRD requirements starting from 1 January 2018. This could force them
to significantly increase the amount of own funds that they need to have in order to continue their activities and could therefore increase the
related costs of performing those activities.
To prevent this situation arising, the Commission feels it opportune to extend the existing exemptions laid down in the CRR, while taking into
account the amount of time that will be necessary to conclude the investment firms review and to prepare, adopt and apply any legislation that
may result from that review.
CONTENT: the proposed provisions aim to extend the exemptions laid down in the CRR for commodity dealers from the large exposures and
own funds requirements and accordingly, amend Regulation 575/2013.
These exemptions apply until 31 December 2020 or the date of entry into force of any amendments, whichever is the earlier.

2015/0295(COD) - 03/03/2016 European Central Bank: opinion, guideline, report
OPINION OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK on a proposal for a regulation amending Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as regards
exemptions for commodity dealers.
The ECB considered that while the large exposures and own funds requirements of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 do not seem to be
tailor-made for commodity dealers, a decision to extend the exemptions from these prudential requirements should take into consideration any
potential systemic risks posed by commodity dealers. Such risks could stem from a number of sources.
The ECB has so far not identified any concrete indications of systemic risk created by commodity dealers that would make it strictly necessary
at this stage to remove the exemptions for requirements concerning large exposures and own funds that apply at present.
Despite the considerable growth of the commodity derivatives markets over the past 15 years, there is no conclusive evidence, according to
the ECB, that commodity derivatives trading has adverse effects on the wider financial system.
However, a detailed impact analysis appears to be a necessary step in terms of taking the most appropriate decision regarding the removal or
the temporary extension of the exemptions. In particular, the ECB stated that consideration should be given to level playing-field issues relative
to credit institutions which trade in commodities.
The ECB considered that the exemptions should indeed only be of temporary nature. The European Commission is expected to present a
proposal for a comprehensive review of the prudential regulation of investment firms. The rationale for, and the objective of, a temporary
extension of the exemptions should be confined to the avoidance of significant regulatory changes before such a comprehensive review, which
should be carried out as soon as possible.

2015/0295(COD) - 21/03/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs adopted the report by Sander LOONES (ECR, BE) on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as regards exemptions for commodity dealers.
The committee recommended that the European Parliament adopt its position at first reading, taking over the Commission proposal.
To recall, the proposed Regulation aims to extend the exemptions laid down in the CRR for commodity dealers from the large exposures and
own funds requirements and accordingly, amend Regulation 575/2013.
The prudential framework applicable to investment firms (including commodity dealers) laid down in the CRR and Directive 2013/36/EC (the
Capital Requirements Directive) is currently under review.
However, it is highly improbable that any legislation that may result from this review can be prepared, adopted and applied before the current
exemptions expire (31 December 2017).
This situation could force them to significantly increase the amount of own funds that they need to have in order to continue their activities and
could therefore increase the related costs of performing those activities.
In order to prevent this situation from arising, the Commission considered it necessary to extend the existing exemptions laid down in the CRR
and that account should be taken of the amount of time that will be necessary to conclude the investment firms review and to prepare, adopt
and apply any legislation that may result from that review.

2015/0295(COD) - 11/05/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading

The European Parliament adopted by 547 votes to 60, with 50 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as regards exemptions for commodity dealers.
Parliament adopted its position at first reading under the ordinary legislative procedure, taking over the Commission proposal.
Regulation (EU) nº 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (CRR) exempt commodity dealers from large exposures
requirements and from own funds requirements respectively. Both exemptions expire on 31 December 2017.
The prudential framework applicable to investment firms (including commodity dealers) is currently under review. The finalisation of the review
and the adoption of new legislation that may be required in light of that review will be concluded only after 31 December 2017.
Therefore, the proposed Regulation seeks to extend the exemptions laid down in the CRR for commodity dealers from the large exposures
and own funds requirements until 31 December 2020 and accordingly, amend Regulation 575/2013.

2015/0295(COD) - 08/06/2016 Final act
PURPOSE: to extend the period during which commodity dealers are exempted from certain requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) nº
575/2013 on capital requirements (the 'Capital Requirements Regulation' or 'CRR').
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Regulation (EU) 2016/1014 of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as
regards exemptions for commodity dealers.
CONTENT: this Regulation amends Regulation (EU) nº 575/2013 in order to extend the exemptions laid down in the CRR for commodity
dealers from the large exposures and own funds requirements. These exemptions apply until 31 December 2020 or the date of entry into force
of any amendments, whichever is the earlier.
To recall, Regulation (EU) nº 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council exempt commodity dealers from large exposures
requirements and from own funds requirements respectively. Both exemptions expire on 31 December 2017.
The prudential framework applicable to investment firms (including commodity dealers) is currently under review. The results will determine the
appropriate prudential treatment of commodity dealers. The finalisation of the review and the adoption of new legislation that may be required
in light of that review will be concluded only after 31 December 2017.
A decision to apply the requirements for large exposures and own funds requirements to commodity dealers should be a thoroughly reasoned
one, based on conclusions of the investment firms review, and should be clearly expressed in legislation.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 19.7.2016.
