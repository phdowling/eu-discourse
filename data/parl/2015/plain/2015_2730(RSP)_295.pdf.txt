Summary

2015/2730(RSP) - 11/06/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a resolution on recent revelations on high-level corruption cases in FIFA, following the arrest of 14 FIFA
officials, including its Vice-President, on 27 May 2015 by Swiss authorities in Zurich.
The resolution was tabled by the Greens/EFA, S&D, ALDE, ECR, EPP, GUE/NGL and EFDD groups.
Parliament condemned the systemic and despicable corruption exposed at FIFA and put on record its view that these allegations were far from
surprising and expressing its long-held view that corruption within FIFA was rampant, systemic and deep-rooted. The organisation had
seriously damaged the integrity of global football, having a devastating impact from the top echelons of professional football to the amateur
grassroots clubs. Members welcomed Joseph Blatters resignation as FIFAs president, and the criminal investigations currently being
conducted. They called on FIFA to select, in a transparent and inclusive way, an appropriate interim leader to replace Joseph Blatter forthwith.
Reforms: Parliament urged FIFAs Executive Committee to implement structural reforms in order to bring transparency and accountability and
to guarantee open, balanced and democratic decision-making processes within FIFA, including in the election process of the new president,
and a zero-tolerance policy on corruption in sport. FIFA must implement strict ethical standards and a code of conduct for its management and
Executive Committee, to be supervised by an independent monitoring body.
Parliament called for an unrestrained commitment from FIFA to a thorough review of:
past and present decisions and for complete transparency going forward, including in respect of the remuneration of executive and
senior management, with a view to establishing internal self-regulatory procedures and effective detection, investigation and
sanctioning mechanisms;
FIFAs statutes, structure, codes and operational policies and practices, the introduction of term limits and independent due diligence
for members of the Executive Committee, including the president, and an external and fully independent financial audit assessing the
reliability of its financial statements.
EU action: Parliament called on the Commission and Member States to:
prioritise work and actions on good governance within the EU Work Plan for sport and to make sure that national sports associations
were fully involved in acting towards better governance at European and international level;
ensure effective enforcement, to tackle any indication of corruption by FIFA and national football association officials on EU territory,
and to enhance European law enforcement cooperation through joint investigation teams and cooperation between prosecution
authorities.
World Cup for 2018 and 2022: Members welcomed the statement by the head of FIFAs Audit and Compliance Committee that the award of the
World Cup for 2018 and 2022 could be invalidated if evidence emerged that the awards only came about as a result of corrupt activities. They
urged the removal of all officials involved in financial misconduct, and a review of decisions linked to corrupt or criminal activities. Parliament
called for the EU to monitor this process closely and to enable the necessary conditions for an unbiased external investigation.
It went on to express concern again about the situation of migrant workers in Qatar, building infrastructure for the 2022 FIFA World Cup,
including: the kafala system, which constituted forced labour, dangerous working conditions, being forced to work in extreme heat six days a
week, and being forced to live in overcrowded and squalid labour camps. Members called on Qatar to enforce fundamental labour rights and
the UNs International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families.
Lastly, Parliament supported the call of the New FIFA Now campaign for the establishment of an independent, non-governmental FIFA Reform
Commission, to be overseen by an independent international authority.
