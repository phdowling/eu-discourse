2015/2167(DEC) - 23/07/2015 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: presentation by the Commission of the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2014 as part of
the 2014 discharge procedure.
Analysis of the accounts of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA).
CONTENT: this Commission document sets out the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2014 as
prepared on the basis of the information presented by the institutions, organisations and bodies of the EU, in accordance with Article 148 (2) of
the Financial Regulation applicable to the EU's General Budget, including the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction
(EMCDDA).
The document contains the figures on which the discharge procedure is based.
On this basis, the Financial Controller of the European Commission ensures the certification of the consolidated accounts as declared by the
institutions, agencies and bodies of the European Union.
Discharge procedure of the EU agencies: the EU Budget finances a wide range of policies and programmes throughout the EU. In accordance
with the priorities set by the European Parliament and the Council in the multi-annual financial framework (MFF), the European Commission
carries out specific programmes, activities and projects in the field with the technical support of some specialised agencies.
The consolidated annual accounts of the EU provide information on the activities of the institutions, agencies and other bodies of the EU from
a budgetary and accrual accounting perspective.

The consolidated reports on the implementation of the general budget of the EU include the budget implementation of all Institutions. Agencies
do not have a separate budget inside the EU budget; and they are partially financed by a Commission budget subsidy.
This document sets out how the Agencies spent and implemented their budget in 2014. Each agency is subject to its own discharge
procedure.
EMCDDA: in 2014, the tasks and budget of this agency were as follows:
description of the Centre's tasks: the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, which is located in Lisbon (PT), was
established by Council Regulation (EEC) No 302/93 and its main task is to collect data on drugs and drug addiction in order to prepare
and publish information at European level that is objective, reliable and comparable;
the Centre's budget for the financial year 2014: the Centres budget for 2014, as presented in the Commission document on the
consolidated annual accounts of the European Union, gives the following figures:
Commitment appropriations :
- committed : EUR 16 million;
- paid : EUR 16 million;
- carried-over : 0.
Payment appropriations :
- committed : EUR 16 million;
- paid : EUR 15 million;
- carried-over : EUR 1 million.
Please refer also to the final accounts of the Monitoring Centre.

2015/2167(DEC) - 08/09/2015 Court of Auditors: opinion, report
PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug
Addiction for the financial year 2014, together with the Centres reply.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit concerned, amongst others, the annual accounts of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA).
Statement of assurance: pursuant to the provisions of Article 287 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the Court
has audited:
the annual accounts of the Agency, which comprise the financial statements and the reports on the implementation of the budget for
the financial year ended 31 December 2014; and
the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying those accounts.
Opinion on the reliability of the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the Centres annual accounts present fairly, in all material respects, its financial
position as at 31 December 2014 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions
of its Financial Regulation and the accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
Opinion on the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the transactions underlying the annual
accounts for the year ended 31 December 2014 are legal and regular in all material respects.
The report also makes a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of the Centre, accompanied by the latters
response. The main observations may be summarised as follows:
The Courts observations:
budgetary management: the Court noted that carry-over of committed appropriations were high for administrative expenditure at 26%
which mainly related to an accelerated implementation of the multiannual ICT strategy.
The Centres replies:
budgetary management: the Centre stated that the carry-forward was the result of a well-founded, structured process aimed at
ensuring the sound management of operations.
Lastly, the Court of Auditors report contains a summary of the Centres activities in 2014. This is focused on the following:
Budget: EUR 15.85 million of which the Union subsidy amounts to 93.4%.
Activities:
running a computerised network for the collection and exchange of information called the European Information Network on Drugs and
Drug Addiction (Reitox);
various publications (e.g. annual report on the state of the drug problem in Europe; statistical bulletin, Drugnet Europe newsletter);
setting-up/updating/content development of public EMCDDA website (best practice portal - exchange on drug demand reduction

action;
publication of promotional brochures, media products, press releases and fact sheets;

2015/2167(DEC) - 27/01/2016 Supplementary non-legislative basic document
Having examined the revenue and expenditure accounts for the financial year 2014 and the balance sheet as at 31 December 2014 of the
European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDD), as well as the Court of Auditors' report on the annual accounts of the
Centre for the financial year 2014, accompanied by the Centre's replies to the Court's observations, the Council recommended the European
Parliament to give a discharge to the Director of the Centre in respect of the implementation of the budget for the financial year 2014.
The Council welcomed the Court's opinion that, in all material respects, the Centre's annual accounts present fairly its financial position as at
31 December 2014 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions of the
Centre's Financial Regulation and the accounting rules adopted by the Commission's accounting officer, and that the underlying transactions
for 2014 are legal and regular in all material respects.
Nevertheless, the Council has made some observations which may be summarised as follows:
financial programming: the Council noted that a high level of commitment appropriations for administrative expenditure was carried
over to 2015. It called on the Centre to continue improving its financial programming and monitoring of the budget implementation in
order to reduce the level of carry-overs to the following financial year to the strict minimum, in line with the budgetary principle of
annuality.

2015/2167(DEC) - 07/04/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Derek VAUGHAN (S&D, UK) on discharge in respect of the implementation of the
budget of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction for the financial year 2014.
The parliamentary committee calls on the European Parliament to grant the Centres Director discharge in respect of the implementation of the
Centres budget for the financial year 2014.
Noting that the Court of Auditors issued a statement of assurance as to the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the
underlying transactions for the financial year 2014, Members call on Parliament to approve the closure of the Centres accounts. They made,
however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is granted, in addition to the general
recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies:
Centres financial statements: Members note the final budget of the Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction for the financial
year 2014 was EUR 15 675 036 representing a decrease of 3.88 % compared to 2013.
Budget and financial management: Members note that the budget monitoring efforts during the financial year 2014 resulted in a
budget implementation rate of 99.62 % and that the payment appropriations execution rate was 94.93 %, representing a slight
decrease of 2.78 % compared to 2013. They note that 26% of administrative expenditure was carried over because they mainly relate
to multiannual projects.
Members also made a series of observations regarding commitments and carryovers, as well as on internal audit and control procedures. In
regard to preventing and managing conflicts of interest, Members remind the Centre that it must adopt binding internal rules on
whistle-blowers; further calls on the Centre to establish clear rules against "revolving doors".
Lastly, Members note that the Centre continued its efforts to find a suitable solution for some areas of its Cais do Sodré Relógio building which
remains partially unused. They acknowledge that the negotiations with the Lisbon Port Authority, the owner of the premises, for the reduction
of the rent are in progress. They call on the Centre to inform the discharge authority on the further progress in this issue.
