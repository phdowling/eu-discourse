2015/2281(INI) - 11/05/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Culture and Education adopted the own-initiative report by Zdzis?aw KRASNOD?BSKI (ECR, PL) on the follow-up of the
Strategic Framework for European cooperation in education and training (ET2020).
While recalling that inclusive and high-quality education and training are essential for Europe´s cultural, economic and social development,
Members regretted that huge problems in terms of quality, accessibility and socio-economic discrimination still remain unsolved in education
and training. More ambitious, coordinated and effective policy actions at both European and national level should be delivered.
The ET2020 Strategic Framework: the report welcomed the narrowing of the number of ET2020 priority areas to six enumerating specific
issues from which Member States can choose to fulfil accordingly their own needs and conditions, but noted that the effectiveness and the
operational aspect of ET2020 need to be enhanced and a work programme adopted.
Members also welcomed the proposed extension of the work cycle from 3 years to 5, in order to better implement the long-term strategic goals
and work on issues such as underachievement of pupils in some study fields, low participation rates in adult learning, early school leaving,
social inclusion, civic engagement, gender gaps and employability rates of graduates. They called on the Commission to improve the
representation of different stakeholders in those groups, notably by including more education experts, youth workers, representatives of civil
society, teachers and faculty members whose experience on the ground is essential to achieving the ET2020 goals.
The report welcomed the strengthening of the steering role of informal bodies within ET2020, as well as the creation of feedback loops linking
the High Level Group, the Director-General groupings and the Working Groups.
Pointing out the risks linked with increasing radicalisation, violence, bullying and behavioural problems starting at the primary level, Members
called on Commission to conduct research at EU level and present an overview of the situation in all Member States.
The report welcomed the new ET2020 priority of improving support for teachers and raising their status, which is essential for them to be able
to command the necessary respect, thus making their profession more attractive.
Members strongly believe that investing in early childhood education and care (ECEC) brings greater returns than investing in any other stage
of education; points out that investing in the early years of education has been proven to reduce later costs.
Quality of education and training: Members called for the development of good practices in assessing qualitative progress and investment in
the use of quality data with stakeholders at local, regional and national level, notwithstanding the relevance of the indicators and benchmarks
used in the ET2020 framework. Concerned that the level of youth unemployment in the EU remains high and that the employment rate of
higher education graduates has decreased, Member States are called upon to channel investment into inclusive education which responds to
societal challenges with regard to ensuring equal access and opportunities for all.
Greater inclusiveness is called for in education and training to cater for people with disabilities or with special needs. Members stressed the
important role of mobility programmes such as Erasmus+ in stimulating the development of transversal skills and competences among young
people.
The report highlighted that the side-effects of the Bologna process and student mobility should be examined and evaluated and that
educational institutions should apply flexibility when using modules and the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS).
The report noted that particular attention should be given to simplifying and rationalising existing EU instruments on skills and qualifications
directed to the wider public.

Migration and education: Members stressed that the challenges posed to education and training systems by intra- and extra-European
migration and the current refugee and humanitarian crisis should be addressed at European, national and regional level. In addition, failure to
provide migrants, refugees and asylum seekers with education and training will negatively influence their future employability and ultimately,
their integration and contribution to society.
In this context, Members called for:
measures to integrate intra- and extra- European migrant, refugee and asylum seeker children into education and training systems;
the creation of differentiated synergies between the ET2020 Working Groups and networks such as the Radicalisation Awareness
Network (RAN) Working Group on Education;
the establishment of the relevant Expert Group as provided for in the European Union Work Plan for Youth for 2016-2018;
the facilitation of measures for migrant, refugee and asylum seeker students enrolling at university level, without prejudice to national
rules and competences on access to education and training;
the creation of education corridors which will enable students who are refugees or come from conflict zones to enrol at European
universities;
support at EU and national level for non-profit institutions providing assistance to migrant, refugee and asylum seeker academics in
science and other professional areas.
Lastly, the report emphasised the need to tackle gender gaps and to recognise the particular needs of young women by including the gender
perspective in ET 2020.

2015/2281(INI) - 23/06/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 409 votes to 108 with 65 abstentions a resolution on the follow-up of the Strategic Framework for
European cooperation in education and training (ET2020).
While recalling that inclusive and high-quality education and training are essential for Europe´s cultural, economic and social development,
Parliament regretted that huge problems in terms of quality, accessibility and socio-economic discrimination still remain unsolved in education
and training. More ambitious, coordinated and effective policy actions at both European and national level should be delivered.

and work on issues such as underachievement of pupils in some study fields, low participation rates in adult learning, early school leaving,
social inclusion, civic engagement, gender gaps and employability rates of graduates.
Parliament acknowledged the role civil society organisations play in reaching out to local, regional and national stakeholders and citizens on
European cooperation in education and training, and calls for them to receive financial support under Erasmus+ (KA3) and the European
Social Fund.
It called on the Commission to improve the representation of different stakeholders in those groups, notably by including more education
experts, youth workers, representatives of civil society, teachers and faculty members whose experience on the ground is essential to
achieving the ET2020 goals. The resolution welcomed the strengthening of the steering role of informal bodies within ET2020, as well as the

people.
It highlighted that the side-effects of the Bologna process and student mobility should be examined and evaluated and that educational
institutions should apply flexibility when using modules and the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS). Parliament stressed the importance
of an overall framework of recognition of qualifications and diplomas as key in ensuring cross-border educational and labour mobility.
It noted that particular attention should be given to simplifying and rationalising existing EU instruments on skills and qualifications directed to
the wider public.
Migration and education: Parliament stressed that the challenges posed to education and training systems by intra- and extra-European
migration and the current refugee and humanitarian crisis should be addressed at European, national and regional level. In addition, failure to
provide migrants, refugees and asylum seekers with education and training will negatively influence their future employability and ultimately,

their integration and contribution to society.
In this context, Parliament called for:
better cooperation between EU and national authorities in order to find the right approach to swiftly, fully and sustainably integrating
refugees and migrants into education and training systems;
measures to integrate intra- and extra- European migrant, refugee and asylum seeker children into education and training systems;
looking at the possibilities of integrating migrant teachers and academics into European education systems and to putting their
language and teaching skills and experience to good use;
advice and support for migrant, refugee and asylum seeker children seeking to access education services through the provision of
clear information and visible contact points;
setting up helpdesks and guidelines for teachers in handling various types of diversity in a positive way and promoting intercultural
dialogue in the classroom, as well as guidance when confronted with students at risk of being radicalised;
the creation of differentiated synergies between the ET2020 Working Groups and networks such as the Radicalisation Awareness
Network (RAN) Working Group on Education;
mechanisms for improving the understanding and identification of the qualifications of migrants, refugees and asylum seekers, since
many entering the EU come with no proof of their formal qualifications;
the establishment of the relevant Expert Group as provided for in the European Union Work Plan for Youth for 2016-2018;
measures for migrant, refugee and asylum seeker students enrolling at university level, without prejudice to national rules and
competences on access to education and training;
stressing the important role of non-formal and informal learning, as well as participation in sports and volunteer activities;
the creation of education corridors which will enable students who are refugees or come from conflict zones to enrol at European
universities;
facilitating enrolment of migrant students at all educational levels;
evaluating the Science4Refugees programme;
support at EU and national level for non-profit institutions providing assistance to migrant, refugee and asylum seeker academics in
science and other professional areas.
Lastly, Parliament emphasised the need to tackle gender gaps and to recognise the particular needs of young women by including the gender
perspective in ET 2020.
