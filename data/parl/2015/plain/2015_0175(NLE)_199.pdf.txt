2015/0175(NLE) - 07/08/2015 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude, on behalf of the European Union, the Amending Protocol to the Agreement between the European Community and
the Principality of Liechtenstein providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in Council Directive 2003/48/EC on taxation of savings
income in the form of interest payments.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to
follow its opinion.
BACKGROUND: following the adoption of Council Directive 2003/48/EC, the Savings Directive, and in order to preserve the level playing field
of economic operators, the EU signed Agreements with Liechtenstein providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in the Directive.
The importance of automatic exchange of information as a means to combat cross-border tax fraud and tax evasion by ensuring full tax
transparency and cooperation between tax administrations worldwide has also been recognised at the international level. In this regard, the
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) was mandated by the G20 to develop a single global standard for
automatic exchange of financial account information. The Global Standard was released by the OECD Council in July 2014.
Following the adoption of a proposal to update the Savings Directive, the Commission adopted on 17 June 2011 a recommendation for a
mandate to initiate negotiations with Liechtenstein in order to upgrade the EUs Agreements with those countries in line with international
developments and to ensure that those countries continue to apply measures equivalent to those in the EU.
On 14 May 2013, the Council reached an agreement on the Negotiating Mandate.
On the basis of a proposal presented by the Commission in June 2013, the Council on 9 December 2014 adopted Directive 2014/107/EU
amending Directive 2011/16/EU and extending the mandatory automatic exchange of information between EU tax authorities to a full range of

financial items in accordance with the Global Standard.
As Directive 2014/107/EU is generally broader in scope than Directive 2003/48/EC and provides that in cases of overlap of scope, Directive
2014/107/EU prevails, the Commission adopted a proposal to repeal Directive 2003/48/EC.
The Commission considered it crucial to ensure that the amendment of the existing Savings Agreement with Liechtenstein is in line with EU
and international developments. This will increase tax transparency in Europe and will be the legal basis for implementing the OECD Global
Standard on automatic exchange of information between Liechtenstein and the EU.
CONTENT: under this proposal, the Council is called upon to approve, on behalf of the European Union, the Amending Protocol to the
Agreement between the European Community and the Principality of Liechtenstein providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in
Council Directive 2003/48/EC on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments.
The Amending Protocol implements the Global Standard between EU Member States and Liechtenstein.
It also replaces the existing articles and Annexes with a new set of provisions comprising 10 Articles, an Annex I that reflects the OECD
Common Reporting Standard which is part of the Global Standard, an Annex II that reflects important parts of the OECD Commentaries to the
Global Standard and an Annex III that lists the Competent Authorities of Liechtenstein and of each Member State.
The new Articles reflect the articles of the OECD Model Competent Authority agreement for the implementation of the Global Standard. They
include, inter alia:
a full set of provisions on exchange of information upon request that follows the latest text of the OECD Model Tax Convention;
a more detailed set of provisions on data protection;
provisions on amendments to the Agreement, including a quick mechanism for provisional application by one of the Contracting
Parties of amendments to the Global Standard, on the condition of consent by the other Party.
The Amending Protocol includes provisions on the entry into force and application. It deals with issues on the transition from the existing
Agreement to the amended Agreement, with regard to requests for information, credits available to beneficial owners for withholding tax, final
payments of withholding tax by Liechtenstein to Member States and final exchange of information under the voluntary disclosure mechanism.
The revised Agreement is supplemented by two Joint Declarations of the contracting parties.

2015/0175(NLE) - 18/11/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs adopted the report by Sander LOONES (ECR, BE) on the proposal for a Council decision
on the conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Amending Protocol to the Agreement between the European Community and the
Principality of Liechtenstein providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in Council Directive 2003/48/EC on taxation of savings
income in the form of interest payments.
The committee recommended the European Parliament to approve the conclusion of the Amending Protocol to the Agreement.
The Amending Protocol seeks to implement the Global Standard between EU Member States and Liechtenstein. It aims at ensuring that
Liechtenstein applies strengthened measures that are equivalent to the EU legal framework and that it complies with the automatic exchange
of financial account information promoted by the 2014 OECD global standards.

2015/0175(NLE) - 02/12/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 562 votes to 30, with 49 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a Council decision on
the conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Amending Protocol to the Agreement between the European Community and the
Principality of Liechtenstein providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in Council Directive 2003/48/EC on taxation of savings
income in the form of interest payments.
Parliament approved the conclusion of the Amending Protocol to the Agreement which seeks to implement the Global Standard for the
automatic exchange of financial account information between EU Member States and Liechtenstein. This Standard was published by the
OECD Council in July 2014.

2015/0175(NLE) - 08/12/2015 Final act
PURPOSE: to conclude an the Amending Protocol to the Agreement between the European Community and Liechtenstein to allow tax
administrations to extend the automatic exchange of information and to improve cross-border access to information on private savers.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Council Decision (EU) 2015/2453 on the conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Amending Protocol to
the Agreement between the European Community and Liechtenstein the providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in Council
Directive 2003/48/EC on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments.
CONTENT: by this Decision, the Council approves the Amending Protocol to the Agreement between the European Community
and Liechtenstein providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in Council Directive 2003/48/EC on taxation of savings income in the
form of interest payments is hereby approved on behalf of the Union. That directive (2003/48/EC) has since been repealed to eliminate an
overlap with Directive 2014/107/EU, which includes strengthened provisions to prevent tax evasion.
The Amending Protocol to the Agreement between the EU and Liechtenstein was signed on 28
October 2015. The text of the Protocol
aligns the Agreement with the latest developments at international level concerning automatic exchange of information, namely the Global
Standard for automatic exchange of financial account information in tax matters developed by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and

Development (OECD).
The text of the Agreement, as amended by the Amending Protocol, will allow the implementation of the Global Standard in relations between
the EU and Liechtenstein, and accordingly, prevent tax fraud and tax evasion.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 08.12.2015.
