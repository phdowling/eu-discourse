Summary

2015/2267(IMM) - 28/01/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Legal Affairs unanimously adopted the report by Laura FERRARA (EFDD, IT) in which it recommended the European
Parliament to waive the immunity of Florian PHILIPPOT (ENF, FR).
Members stated that a French court asked for the immunity of Florian Philippot MEP to be waived for the purposes of criminal proceedings

instituted by Qatar (Mr Philippot is accused of having defamed that country by suggesting, in a radio programme broadcast on 9 January 2015
and in a television programme broadcast on 19 January 2015, that Qatar finances terrorism).
Recalling that Article 8 of Protocol No 7 on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Union stipulates that Members of the European
Parliament may not be subject to any form of inquiry, detention or legal proceedings in respect of opinions expressed or votes cast by them in
the performance of their duties, Members considered that the conditions for the waiver of Mr Philippots immunity are not met.
The committee noted that in general terms the purpose of parliamentary immunity is to allow the legislature to carry out its constitutional tasks
without improper interference from outside, especially from the executive. That principle plainly holds equally good when criminal proceedings
for defamation are instituted against a Member by a country outside the European Union.
Therefore, the committee on legal affairs recommended that the European Parliament should not waive the immunity of Florian Philippot.

2015/2267(IMM) - 02/02/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament decided not to waive the immunity of Florian PHILIPPOT (ENF, FR).
Parliament stated that a French court asked for the immunity of Florian Philippot MEP to be waived for the purposes of criminal proceedings
instituted by Qatar following an accusation of defamation.
Recalling that this immunity implies that opinions cannot be challenged, whether they are expressed during official meetings of Parliament or
elsewhere, for example in the media, when there is a link between the opinion expressed and parliamentary duties, Parliament considered that
the conditions for the waiver of Mr Philippots immunity are not met.
Therefore, the European Parliament decided not to waive the immunity of Florian Philippot.
