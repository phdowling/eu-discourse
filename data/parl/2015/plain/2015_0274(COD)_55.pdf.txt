Briefing

2015/0274(COD) - 02/12/2015 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to improve waste management in the Union in order to facilitate Europes transition to a circular economy.
PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with Council.
BACKGROUND: the Commission considers that recent trends suggest that turning waste into a resource is an essential part of increasing
resource efficiency and closing the loop in a circular economy. The Unions economy currently loses a significant amount of potential
secondary raw materials that are found in waste streams. In 2013, total waste generation in the EU amounted to approximately 2.5 billion tons
of which 1.6 billion tons were not reused or recycled and therefore lost for the European economy. It is estimated that an additional 600 million
tons could be recycled or reused. By way of example, only a limited share (43%) of the municipal waste generated in the Union was recycled,
with the rest being landfilled (31%) or incinerated (26%).
With respect to waste management, the Union also faces large differences amongst its Member States. In 2011, while six Member States
landfilled less than 3% of their municipal waste, 18 landfilled over 50%, with some exceeding 90%. This uneven situation needs to be
redressed.
The proposal aiming to amend Directive 1993/31/EC on waste is part of a series of measures on the circular economy which also includes
proposals to amend:
Directive 2008/98/EC on waste;
Directive 1994/62/EC on package and packaging waste;
Directive 2000/53/EC on end-of-life vehicles;
Directive 2006/66/EC on batteries and accumulators and waste batteries and accumulators;
Directive 2012/19/EU on waste electrical and electronic equipment.
The proposals build in part on the proposal that the Commission tabled in July 2014 and subsequently withdrew in February 2015. They are in
line with the objectives of the Resource Efficiency Roadmap and the 7th Environment Action Programme including:
full implementation of the waste hierarchy in all Member States;
decline in absolute and per capita waste generation;
ensuring high quality recycling and the use of recycled waste as a major, reliable source of raw materials for the Union.
They also contribute to the implementation of the EU Raw Materials Initiative and address the need to prevent food waste.
IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment led to the conclusion that the options envisaged will bring the following benefits:
reduction of the administrative burden in particular for small establishments or undertakings, simplification and better implementation
including by keeping targets fit for purpose;
more than 170,000 direct jobs could be created by 2035, most of them impossible to delocalize outside the EU;
GHG emission reduction more than 600 millions of tons of green house gas could be avoided between 2015 and 2035;
positive effects on the competitiveness of the EU waste management and recycling sectors as well as on the EU manufacturing
sector ;
reinjection into the EU economy of secondary raw materials which in turn will reduce the dependency of the EU on raw materials
imports.
CONTENT: the proposal aims to amend the targets laid down in Council Directive 1999/31/EC14 setting landfill restrictions to make them
better reflect the Union's ambition to move to a circular economy and make progress in the implementation of the Raw Materials Initiative by
reducing landfilling of waste destined for landfills for non-hazardous waste.
The main points are as follows:
Alignment of definitions: it is proposed that municipal waste should be clearly defined in line with the definition used for statistical purposes by
the European Statistical Office and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. The definitions in Directives 1999/31/EC
should be aligned to those of Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council.

Reduction in landfill waste: Member States should take the necessary measures to ensure that by 2030 the amount of municipal waste
landfilled is reduced to 10% of the total amount of municipal waste generated.
Estonia, Greece, Croatia, Latvia, Malta, Romania and Slovakia may obtain five additional years for the attainment of the target. In the event of
an extension, the Member State should take the necessary measures to reduce by 2030 the amount of municipal waste landfilled to 20% of
the total amount of municipal waste generated.
By 31 December 2024 at the latest, the Commission should examine the target with a view to reducing it and introducing restrictions to the
landfilling of non-hazardous waste other than municipal waste. To this end, the Commission should send a report accompanied by a proposal,
if appropriate, shall be sent to the European Parliament and the Council. The proposal prohibits the landfilling of biodegradable waste that has
been separately collected.
Reporting: statistical data reported by Member States are essential for the Commission to assess compliance with waste legislation across the
Member States. Member States shall report the data concerning the implementation of the relevant provisions for each calendar year to the
Commission. They shall report this data electronically within 18 months of the end of the reporting year for which the data are collected.
The Commission shall review the data reported and publish a report on the results of its review.
Early warning system: the proposal establishes an early warning system to detect shortcomings and allow taking action ahead of the deadlines
for meeting the targets. The Commission shall draw up reports three years before each time-limit laid down.
Simplification and streamlining of reporting obligations: it is proposed to repeal provisions obliging Member States to produce implementation
reports every three years and use exclusively the statistical data which Member States report every year to the Commission.
DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of
the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

2015/0274(COD) - 07/02/2017 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety adopted the report by Simona BONAFÈ (S&D, IT) on the proposal for a
directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 1999/31/EC on the landfill of waste.
The committee recommended that the European Parliaments position adopted at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure
should amend the Commission proposal as follows:
Progressive phasing out of landfilling: Members stressed that the revision of the Directive on the landfill of waste will offer the possibility for
waste management to be transformed into sustainable material management. They also proposed to include in the general objective of the
Directive a progressive phasing out (as opposed to a reduction) of landfilling which is considered as a fundamental condition to support the
Union's transition towards a circular economy.
More ambitious goal in 2030: Members proposed that Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that by 2030 the annual
amount of municipal waste landfilled is reduced to 5 % (instead of 10 %) of the total amount of municipal waste generated.
By 31 December 2030, Member States shall accept only residual municipal waste (waste resulting from a treatment or a recovery operation,
including recycling, which cannot be recovered further) in landfills for non-hazardous waste.
Additional transition period: the Commission proposed that Estonia, Greece, Croatia, Latvia, Malta, Romania and Slovakia may obtain five
additional years for the attainment of the target. Members suggested that a Member State may request an extension to attain the target, if it
has landfilled more than 65 % of its municipal waste in 2013. The request for extension shall be accompanied by an implementation plan
which shall be assessed the Commission on the basis of specific criteria.
Waste other than municipal waste: Members called on the Commission, by 31 December 2018 at the latest, to examine the possibility to
introduce a target and restrictions to the landfilling of non-hazardous waste other than municipal waste. By 31 December 2025, Member States
shall map existing landfills and indicate their potential for enhanced landfill mining and share information.
Exchange of best practices and information: Members suggested establishing a platform for a regular and structured exchange of best
practices and information between the Commission and the Member States on the practical implementation of the requirements of this
Directive.
Instruments to promote a shift to a circular economy: Member States shall make use of adequate economic instruments and shall take other
measures to provide incentives for the application of the waste hierarchy.
Uniform technical provisions: Members proposed a very precise wording in order to allow the Commission to develop and adopt implementing
acts as regards: (i) the determination of the permeability coefficient of landfills and for the sampling of waste; (ii) the development of a
European standard for the sampling of waste.

2015/0274(COD) - 14/03/2017 Text adopted by Parliament, partial vote at 1st reading/single
reading
The European Parliament adopted by 583 votes to 95, with 18 abstentions, amendments to the proposal for a directive of the European
Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 1999/31/EC on the landfill of waste.
The matter was referred back to the committee responsible for interinstitutional negotiations. The vote on the legislative resolution was
postponed to later session.
The main amendments adopted in plenary concerned the following issues:

Progressive phasing out of landfilling: Members stressed that the revision of the Directive on the landfill of waste will offer the possibility for
waste management to be transformed into sustainable material management. They also proposed to include in the general objective of the
Directive a progressive phasing out (as opposed to a reduction) of landfilling which is considered as a fundamental condition to support the
Union's transition towards a circular economy.
This objective shall fit into an integrated policy which ensures a sound application of the waste hierarchy, enhances a shift towards prevention,
reuse and recycling, and prevents a shift from landfilling towards incineration.
More ambitious goal in 2030: Parliament proposed that Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that by 2030 the annual
amount of municipal waste landfilled is reduced to 5 % (instead of 10 %) of the total amount of municipal waste generated.
By 31 December 2030, Member States shall accept only residual municipal waste (waste resulting from a treatment or a recovery operation,
including recycling, which cannot be recovered further) in landfills for non-hazardous waste.
Additional transition period: the Commission proposed that seven countries (Estonia, Greece, Croatia, Latvia, Malta, Romania and Slovakia)
may obtain five additional years for the attainment of the target. Parliament suggested that a Member State may request an extension to attain
the target, if it has landfilled more than 65 % of its municipal waste in 2013 . The request for extension shall be accompanied by an
implementation plan which shall be assessed the Commission on the basis of specific criteria.
Waste other than municipal waste: Parliament called on the Commission to:
examine, by 31 December 2018 at the latest, the possibility to introduce a target and restrictions to the landfilling of non-hazardous
waste other than municipal waste. To this end, its report shall be accompanied by a legislative proposal, if appropriate;
further examine the feasibility of proposing a regulatory framework for enhanced landfill mining so as to permit the retrieval of
secondary raw materials that are present in existing landfills. By 31 December 2025 Member States shall map existing landfills and
indicate their potential for enhanced landfill mining and share information.
Exchange of best practices and information: Parliament suggested establishing a platform for a regular and structured exchange of best
practices and information between the Commission and the Member States on the practical implementation of the requirements of this
Directive.
Instruments to promote a shift to a circular economy: Member States shall make use of adequate economic instruments and shall take other
measures to provide incentives for the application of the waste hierarchy.
Uniform technical provisions: lastly, Parliament proposed a very precise wording in order to allow the Commission to develop and adopt
implementing acts as regards: (i) the determination of the permeability coefficient of landfills and for the sampling of waste; (ii) the
development of a European standard for the sampling of waste.
