Summary

The European Parliament adopted by 626 votes to 4 with 11 abstentions a resolution on South Sudan, including recent child abductions. The
resolution was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ECR, ALDE, GUE/NGL, Greens/EFA, EFDD groups.
Parliament stated that it was deeply concerned by the worsening security and humanitarian situation in South Sudan, which could destabilise
the whole East Africa region. It called for a cessation of violence and for the formation of a transitional government of national unity, and full
access to humanitarian assistance. All parties to the conflict were urged to reach a power-sharing agreement and to engage in unconditional
and all-inclusive political talks in good faith with a view to the successful conclusion of the negotiations. Parliament expressed deep
disappointment that after more than a year of negotiations under the auspices of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), no
significant progress had been made.
Recruitment of children: Reminding all parties that the recruitment of children in armed forces was a grave violation of international law,
Members called for the immediate release and safe return of all children recruited by armed forces since the beginning of the conflict in
December 2013. They recalled also the commitment made in 2009, and renewed in 2012, by the South Sudanese authorities to end the
recruitment of children in conflict, and deplored the fact that this commitment had not been fully respected.
The Commission was asked to assist in mobilising resources to help with the long-term reintegration of children recruited into armed forces
and those affected by the conflict, in coordination with the Office of the UN Special Representative for Children in Armed Conflict, UNICEF and
other agencies;
Arms embargo: the resolution underlined the need for the adoption of a comprehensive arms embargo at regional and international level to
halt the supply of weapons to individuals and groups that had committed serious violations of human rights, war crimes and crimes against
humanity, and to protect civilians who are at grave risk. It welcomed the adoption of UN Security Council resolution 2206, which would impose
targeted sanctions directly affecting those who have fuelled the conflict, and called for its immediate implementation.
AUCISS report: the AU Peace and Security Council was asked to publish the report of the AU Commission of Inquiry on South Sudan
(AUCISS) on human rights abuses in the country and to follow up on its findings without further delay. Parliament felt that the fact that
publication of the report was a crucial step towards peace and reconciliation. It requested that the Commission and the European External
Action Service actively support the implementation of recommendations by the committee of inquiry, including as regards the possible
establishment of a hybrid court to deal with the atrocities. It also recalled the IGAD Protocol of 25 August 2014, which stated specifically that
individuals identified by the AUCISS as being responsible for serious crimes would not be eligible for participation in the Transitional
Government.
Lastly, Members urged responsible management of South Sudans natural resources to ensure that oil revenues did not fuel the conflict. They
asked the negotiating parties to include transparency and public scrutiny in the oil sector in the peace talks and any final agreement, in such a
way as to allow for the revenue from this resource to be used for the sustainable development of the country and to improve the livelihood of
its population.
