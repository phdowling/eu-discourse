2015/2252(BUD) - 30/09/2015 Commission draft budget
PURPOSE: to present Draft Amending Budget No 7 to the general budget 2015 to ensure the proper management of the refugee crisis.
CONTENT: the purpose of Draft Amending Budget (DAB) No 7 for the year 2015, is to introduce the necessary changes for immediate
budgetary measures under the European Agenda on Migration in the remaining months of 2015, making use of any possibilities for
redeployment of appropriations at this stage of the year, without undermining the implementation of other spending programmes.
It includes the following:
a reinforcement of emergency assistance provided under the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) and the Internal Security
Fund (ISF), for a total amount of EUR 100 million in commitment appropriations;
an increase in the number of establishment plan posts for FRONTEX (+60 posts), EASO (+30) and EUROPOL (+30) to increase their
capacity on the ground. The related reinforcement of salary expenditure amounts to EUR 1.3 million in commitment and payment
appropriations for the three agencies combined;
additional funding for the European Neighbourhood Instrument (EUR 300 million in commitment appropriations), so that the EU
Regional Trust Fund in response to the Syrian crisis ("Madad Fund") can reach at least EUR 500 million;
an increase in payment appropriations for Humanitarian Aid of EUR 55.7 million through redeployment. A request for the transfer of
commitment appropriations for Humanitarian Aid from the Emergency Aid Reserve (EAR) will be made separately, in order to reach
EUR 200 million of humanitarian aid for refugees in need.
Reinforcements requested for the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF), the Internal Security Fund (ISF), and Humanitarian Aid in
this DAB 7/2015 are partly offset by redeployment of EUR 70.5 million in commitment appropriations and EUR 57 million in payment
appropriations currently available in the 2015 budget:

notably from the EU Solidarity Fund (EUR 33.7 million in commitment and payment appropriations); from various budget lines in
heading 2 (EUR 24.8 million in commitment appropriations and EUR 19.8 million in payment appropriations);
EUR 12 million in commitment appropriations and EUR 3.5 million in payment appropriations from the Food and Feed programme.
In addition to redeployment, the reinforcement in commitment appropriations is to be achieved by using the existing margins under the
expenditure ceilings of heading 3 (Security and Citizenship, for the full available amount of EUR 23.2 million) and heading 4 (Global Europe,
for an amount of EUR 300 million), as well as by mobilising the Flexibility Instrument for an amount of EUR 66.1 million to finance emergency
measures under AMIF in heading 3. A proposal to mobilise the Flexibility Instrument is presented in parallel with this DAB.
Overall, the additional measures proposed in this draft amending budget lead to a net increase in the level of commitment appropriations in the
2015 budget of EUR 330.7 million. The level of payment appropriations remains unchanged in 2015, as a large part of the payments will be
made in 2016. Additional needs mentioned in the Communication on Managing the refugee crisis, as compared to the Commission's draft
budget (DB) proposal for 2016, will be included in an amending letter to the 2016 draft budget, to be presented in mid-October. This amending
letter will also include updated estimates for agricultural expenditure.

2015/2252(BUD) - 08/10/2015 Council position on draft budget
On 30 September 2015, the Commission submitted to the Council draft amending budget (DAB) No 7 to the general budget for 2015.
This DAB introduces additional financial measures (in commitment (c/a) and in payment appropriations (p/a)) to be provided in 2015 in
response to the migration crisis.
It includes the following reinforcements:
+EUR 100 million in c/a for the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund and for the Internal Security Fund; - +EUR 300 million in c/a for
the European Neighbourhood Instrument;
+EUR 55.7 million in p/a for Humanitarian Aid;
+120 establishment plan posts for the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders (+60
posts), the European Asylum Support Office (+30 posts) and EUROPOL (+30 posts) and the corresponding additional salary
expenditure of EUR 1.3 million in c/a and in p/a.
The reinforcements in c/a are partly offset by redeployments for an amount of EUR 70.5 million. Therefore, the net effect of this DAB on the
2015 general budget is an increase of c/a for a total amount of EUR 330.7 million.
The Commission has submitted a separate proposal to mobilise the Flexibility Instrument in 2015 to cover the proposed amount of EUR 66.1
million that cannot be financed under the ceiling of heading 3 (Security and Citizenship).
The needs in p/a are entirely covered by redeployments.
On 8 October 2015, the Council adopted its position on DAB No 7/2015 as set out in the explanatory memorandum to the Council position
(see Council document 12511/15).

2015/2252(BUD) - 12/10/2015 Budgetary report tabled for plenary, 1st reading
The Committee on Budgets adopted the report by Eider GARDIAZABAL RUBIAL (S&D, ES) on the Council position on Draft amending budget
No 7/2015 of the European Union for the financial year 2015, Managing the refugee crisis: immediate budgetary measures under the
European Agenda on Migration.
Members recalled that Draft amending budget No 7/2015 aims to reinforce the Union's resources to deal with the current refugee and migrant
crisis, thereby addressing current underfunding in both headings 3 and 4.
Objectives of the Draft amending budget No 7/2015: Members stressed that Draft amending budget No 7/2015 provides a reinforcement of
emergency assistance provided under the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) and the Internal Security Fund for a total amount of
EUR 100 million in commitment appropriations while maintaining the necessary resources, and other programmes financed by AMIF.
DAB No 7/2015 furthermore provides for:
an increase in the number of posts for FRONTEX, EASO and EUROPOL of 120 in total as well as the related appropriations for
salaries until year-end of EUR 1.3 million in commitment and payment appropriations;
additional funding for the European Neighbourhood Instrument for a total amount of EUR 300 million;
an increase in payment appropriations for Humanitarian Aid for an amount of EUR 55.7 million through redeployment.
This DAB is accompanied by a proposal for a decision on the mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument for immediate budgetary measures
under the European Agenda on Migration for an amount of EUR 66.1 million in commitment appropriations.
Provision of structural measures: Members noted the increase in the number of refugees and migrants was not foreseeable when adopting the
current Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020, and it cannot be considered a temporary phenomenon and therefore requires longer
term solutions which need to be addressed in the upcoming annual budgetary procedures and the revision of the Multiannual Financial
Framework.
Acting in due time: whilst welcoming the swift response from the Commission in dealing with the current refugee crisis, Members reiterated the
readiness of the European Parliament to act in due time in accordance with its budgetary responsibilities. They pointed out that the proposed
measures have to be coupled with initiatives aimed at addressing the root causes of the migration and refugees crisis.
Members are convinced that the Union needs to do more to address the current migration and refugee crisis and to help stabilise countries of
origin and assist countries of transit as the proposed measures will certainly not be sufficient, given the overall number of persons seeking

protection in the Union.
The Commission is invited to present a long-term financial plan to respond to the migration and refugee crisis, including search and rescue
operations, and to propose a revision of the Multiannual Financial Framework accordingly.
Intensifying existing measures: Members welcomed the commitment of Member States, made during the informal European Council of 23
September 2015, to mobilise EUR 1 billion in response to the humanitarian situation of migrants and refugees. They called on Member States
to extend and increase their commitment to provide the necessary funds also in the coming years.
2016 budget measures: Members recalled that this issue needs primarily to be addressed in the 2016 budget and called on the Council to
match its words with the corresponding funding in Conciliation. They urged the Council to agree from the outset on an adequate 2016 budget,
including for headings 3 and 4, which will provide sufficient appropriations to manage the current refugee and migration crisis.
Members reminded the Commission and the Council of the recent agreement for a payment plan aimed at putting the Union budget back on a
sustainable track. They noted that the Commission did not propose any additional overall payment appropriations in the 2015 budget but
reverted to the redeployment of already existing resources. According to members, this could increase the burden on payment appropriations
in 2016 which may not be sufficient to meet the actual needs of financial programmes across headings.
Members expected therefore the Commission to come forward in its Amending Letter 2/2016 with an adequate increase in payment
appropriations which corresponds to the commitments undertaken. They stressed that, should additional reinforcements be needed in the
course of the current year to address the migration and refugee crisis. Members called on the Parliament to be ready to accept a further
mobilisation of the flexibility provisions provided for in the Multiannual Financial Framework.
Lastly, Members affirmed their willingness to adopt Draft amending budget No 7/2015 as presented by the Commission as quickly as possible,
given the urgency of the situation and called on Parliament to approve the Council position on Draft amending budget No 7/2015.

2015/2252(BUD) - 14/10/2015 Final act
PURPOSE: adoption of Amending Budget No 7 to the general budget 2015 to ensure the proper management of the refugee crisis.

European Agenda on Migration in the remaining months of 2015, making use of any possibilities for redeployment of appropriations at this
stage of the year under the expenditure ceilings of heading 3 and heading 4 of the Financial Regulation.
Objectives of the Draft amending budget No 7/2015: AB No 7/2015 provides a reinforcement of emergency assistance provided under the

This DAB is accompanied by a proposal for a decision on the mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument for immediate budgetary measures
under the European Agenda on Migration for an amount of EUR 66.1 million in commitment appropriations.

Provision of structural measures: Parliament noted the increase in the number of refugees and migrants was not foreseeable when adopting
the current Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020, and it cannot be considered a temporary phenomenon and therefore requires longer
term solutions which need to be addressed in the upcoming annual budgetary procedures and the revision of the Multiannual Financial
Framework.
Intensify efforts to resolve the crisis: whilst welcoming the swift response from the Commission in dealing with the current refugee crisis,
Parliament reiterated its readiness to act in due time in accordance with its budgetary responsibilities. It pointed out that the proposed
measures have to be coupled with initiatives aimed at addressing the root causes of the migration and refugees crisis.
Parliament is convinced that the Union needs to do more to address the current migration and refugee crisis and to help stabilise countries of

The Commission is invited to present a long-term financial plan to respond to the migration and refugee crisis, including search and rescue
operations, and to propose a revision of the Multiannual Financial Framework accordingly.
Strengthen and intensify existing measures: Parliament welcomed the commitment of Member States, made during the informal European
Council of 23 September 2015, to mobilise EUR 1 billion in response to the humanitarian situation of migrants and refugees. It called on
Member States to extend and increase their commitment to provide the necessary funds also in the coming years.
2016 budget measures: Parliament recalled that this issue needs primarily to be addressed in the 2016 budget and called on the Council to
match its words with the corresponding funding in Conciliation. It urged the Council to agree from the outset on an adequate 2016 budget,
including for headings 3 and 4, which will provide sufficient appropriations to manage the current refugee and migration crisis.
Parliament reminded the Commission and the Council of the recent agreement for a payment plan aimed at putting the Union budget back on
a sustainable track. It noted that the Commission did not propose any additional overall payment appropriations in the 2015 budget but
reverted to the redeployment of already existing resources. According to Parliament, this could increase the burden on payment appropriations
in 2016 which may not be sufficient to meet the actual needs of financial programmes across headings.
Parliament expected therefore the Commission to come forward in its Amending Letter 2/2016 with an adequate increase in payment
appropriations which corresponds to the commitments undertaken. It stressed that, should additional reinforcements be needed in the course
of the current year to address the migration and refugee crisis. Parliament is called upon to be ready to accept a further mobilisation of the
flexibility provisions provided for in the Multiannual Financial Framework.
Hot spots: Parliament welcomed the additional 120 establishment plan posts for agencies and expected this decision to also impact the 2016
budget as well as the budgets for the following years.
It urged the Commission to:
provide updated and consolidated information about the agencies' needs before budgetary Conciliation;
propose a medium-term and long-term strategy for the justice and home affairs agencies' actions: objectives, missions, coordination,
development of hot spots and financial resources.
In an amendment adopted in plenary, Parliament stressed that the European Asylum Support Office
(EASO) should get more staff than is now proposed by the Commission, as it is tasked with assuming a key role in the implementation of the
Common European Asylum System, such as assisting in the processing of asylum applications and in the relocation efforts.
In parallel, the European Parliament adopted the Council position on Draft amending budget No 7/2015.
