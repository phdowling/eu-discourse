Summary

2015/2313(IMM) - 28/01/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Legal Affairs unanimously adopted the report by Kostas CHRYSOGONOS (GUE/NGL, EL) in which it recommended the
European Parliament to waive the immunity of Robert Jaros?aw IWASZKIEWICZ (EFD, PL).

Members recalled that the Prosecutor-General of the Republic of Poland forwarded a request from the Polish General Inspectorate of Road
Traffic for waiver of the immunity of a Polish Member of the European Parliament, in connection with a speeding offence. The Polish General
Inspectorate of Road Traffic claimed that on 7 September 2014, Mr Iwaszkiewicz failed to respect the speed limit in a built-up area where a 50
km/h speed limit was therefore in force by driving the aforementioned vehicle at a speed of 79 km/h, thus exceeding the speed limit by 29
km/h.
From the circumstances of the case it appears that the alleged offence and the ensuing prosecution clearly have nothing to do with the
position of Mr Iwaszkiewicz as a Member of the European Parliament and that there is no evidence of fumus persecutionis (that is to say, a
sufficiently serious and precise suspicion that the request has been brought with the intention of causing political damage to the Member
concerned). Therefore, the committee recommended the European Parliament to waive the parliamentary immunity of Robert Jaros?aw
Iwaszkiewicz.
