Parliament decided to set up a special committee on tax rulings and other measures similar in nature or effect (TAXE 2) to continue and
complete the work of the TAXE 1 special committee and, in particular, examine the outstanding issues outlined the its resolution of 25
November 2015 and to follow up on the implementation, by Member States and the European institutions, of the recommendations contained
in the resolution:
The TAXE 2 special committee shall have 45 members (as the TAXE 1 special committee had) and shall keep the TAXE 1 special committee
structure. The term of office of the TAXE 2 special committee shall be 6 months, beginning on 2 December 2015.
The TAXE 2 special committee shall be vested with the following powers:

to analyse and examine practice in the application of Article 107(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)
regarding tax rulings and other measures similar in nature or effect issued by Member States since 1 January 1991;
to analyse and assess the Commission's practice of keeping under constant review, pursuant to Article 108 TFEU, all systems of aid
existing in Member States;
to analyse and examine compliance by Member States since 1 January 1991 with obligations set out in Council Regulation (EC) No
659/1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Article 108 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
regarding the obligation to cooperate and provide all necessary documents;
to analyse and assess the Commission's practice as regards the proper application of Council Directives 77/799/EEC concerning
mutual assistance by the competent authorities of the Member States in the field of direct taxation and taxation of insurance premiums
and 2011/16/EU on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation regarding communication by Member States to other Member
States, by spontaneous exchange, of information on tax rulings;
analyse and assess compliance by the Member States with the principle of sincere cooperation enshrined in Article 4(3) of the Treaty
on European Union, such as fulfilment of the obligations to facilitate the achievement of the Union's tasks;
to analyse and assess aggressive tax planning carried out by companies established or incorporated in the Member States, also
regarding the third-country dimension including the exchange of information with third countries in this respect.
Lastly, the special committee shall make any recommendations that it deems necessary in this matter.
