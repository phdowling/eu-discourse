OJ L 052 27.02.2016, p. 0001 Summary

2015/0062(NLE) - 05/03/2015 Initial legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude the Agreement between the European Union and the United Arab Emirates on the short-stay visa waiver.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council amended Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing
the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders of the Member States and those whose
nationals are exempt from that requirement. The Regulation was adopted on 20 May 2014 and entered into force on 9 June 2014.
In July 2014, the Commission presented a Recommendation to the Council to authorise it to start negotiations on visa waiver agreements with
each of the following 17 countries: Dominica, Grenada, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the
Grenadines, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, the United Arab Emirates and Vanuatu. On 9
October 2014, the Council addressed negotiating directives to the Commission. The negotiations on the visa waiver agreement with the United

Arab Emirates (UAE) were opened on 5 November 2014 in Brussels. The agreement was initialled by the chief negotiators on 20 November
2014. The Commission considers that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives were attained and that the draft visa waiver
agreement is acceptable to the Union.
CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve the Agreement between the European Union andthe United Arab Emirates on
the short-stay visa waiver.
The content of the agreement may be summarised as follows:
Purpose and duration of stay: the agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of the
United Arab Emirates when travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period.
The agreement takes into account the situation of the Member States that do not yet apply the Schengen acquis in full. As long as they are not
part of the Schengen area without internal borders, the visa waiver confers a right for the nationals of the United Arab Emirates to stay for 90
days in any 180-day on the territory of each of those Member States (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania), independently of the period
calculated for the whole Schengen area.
A provision has been included in the agreement stating that the United Arab Emirates may suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect
of all the Member States of the European Union and that the Union may also only suspend or terminate the agreement in respect of all of its
Member States.
Scope: the visa waiver covers all categories of persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all
kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. For this latter category, each Member State and also the United Arab
Emirates remain free to impose the visa requirement on the citizens of the other Party in accordance with the applicable Union or national law.
The Member States and the United Arab Emirates reserve the right to refuse entry into and short stay in their territories if one or more of these
conditions are not met.
Territorial application: in the case of France and the Netherlands, the visa waiver would entitle nationals of the United Arab Emirates to stay
only in those Member States? European territories.
The provisions of the Agreement do not apply to the United Kingdom and Ireland.
The Agreement establishes a Joint Committee for the management of the Agreement, which shall adopt its rules of procedure.

2015/0062(NLE) - 15/04/2015 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude the Agreement between the European Union and the United Arab Emirates on the short-stay visa waiver.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: the Commission has negotiated on behalf of the EU, an Agreement with the United Arab Emirates on the short-stay visa
waiver.
In accordance with a Council Decision, the Agreement has been signed and is applied on a provisional basis.
It is now necessary to approve this Agreement on behalf of the European Union.
CONTENT: under this proposal, the Council is invited to approve the Agreement between the European Union and the United Arab Emirates
on the short-stay visa waiver.
For further details on the content of the Agreement, please refer to the summary of the initial legislative proposal dated 5.3.2015.
Territorial provisions: the provisions of the Agreement do not apply to the United Kingdom and Ireland.
The Agreement sets up a Joint Committee of experts for the management of the Agreement. The Union is to be represented within that Joint
Committee by the Commission, which should be assisted by the representatives of the Member States.

2015/0062(NLE) - 16/11/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs adopted the report by Mariya GABRIEL (EPP, BG) on the draft Council decision on
the conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Agreement between the European Union and the United Arab Emirates on the
short-stay visa waiver.
The committee recommended the European Parliament to give its consent to the conclusion of the Agreement.
To recall, the Agreement signed on 6 May 2015 provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of the
United Arab Emirates when travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period .
The visa waiver covers all categories of persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all kinds of
purposes, except for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity.
The report is accompanied by a short justification stating that this Agreement on the waiver of short-stay visas represents a culmination of the
deepening of relations between the European Union and the United Arab Emirates and is an additional way of stepping up economic and
cultural relations and intensifying political dialogue on various issues, including human rights and fundamental freedoms.
In the economic sphere, the United Arab Emirates are the only one to be classified as a high-income industrialised country. More than
150 000 European nationals live in the United Arab Emirates, the vast majority of whom have seized opportunities to engage in

economic activities. As regards trade relations, the EU is currently the principal trading partner of the United Arab Emirates, while the
UAE is ranked 14th among the trading partners of the EU and its Member States. Trade was valued at EUR 51 million in 2014. Trade
relations are therefore highly developed, and can only benefit from the visa waiver agreement.
Concerning political relations between the European Union and the United Arab Emirates, they have been based on the cooperation
agreement between the European Union and the Gulf Cooperation Council since 1988. The visa waiver agreement must be viewed in
a wider context as a tool for intensifying cooperation, in which context both parties have a shared interest in stabilising the
macro-region and acting as sound and reliable partners in various fields such as combating terrorism, trafficking in persons and
climate change.
With regard to mobility, the UAE does not present any risk of clandestine immigration or threat to public policy or security, and it has
supplied the European Institutions with the necessary evidence to this effect. In addition, the UAE issues biometric passports to its
citizens.
As regards the implementation and monitoring of the agreement, the rapporteur:
called on the Commission to observe any developments in relation to the criteria regarding clandestine immigration, public policy and
security, including, considerations relating to human rights and fundamental freedoms;
urged the Commission and the authorities of the United Arab Emirates to ensure full reciprocity of the visa waiver, which should permit
equal treatment of all citizens, particularly all citizens of the Union;
encouraged the Commission to review the composition of the joint management committees for future agreements to enable the
European Parliament to be involved in the work of these committees.
Lastly, the rapporteur also queried the practice of signing visa waiver agreements and applying them provisionally before the European
Parliament has approved them, a practice which is liable to reduce Parliaments room for manoeuvre.

2015/0062(NLE) - 15/12/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 537 votes to 80 with 59 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the draft Council decision on the
conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Agreement between the European Union and the United Arab Emirates on the short-stay
visa waiver.
Following the recommendation of its Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, Parliament gave its consent to the conclusion of
the Agreement.
The Agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of the United Arab Emirates when
travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period . The visa waiver covers all
categories of persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all kinds of purposes, except for the
purpose of carrying out a paid activity.

2015/0062(NLE) - 12/02/2016 Final act
PURPOSE: to conclude the Agreement between the European Union and the United Arab Emirates on the short-stay visa waiver.

European Union and the United Arab Emirates on the short-stay visa waiver.
CONTENT: under this Decision, the Agreement between the European Union and the United Arab Emirates on the short-stay visa waiver is
approved on behalf of the Union.
To recall, the Commission negotiated on behalf of the European Union an agreement with the United Arab Emirates on the short-stay visa
waiver. The Agreement has been signed and is applied on a provisional basis as from 6 May 2015.
The Agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of the United Arab Emirates when
travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period . A joint statement on the
interpretation of this duration of 90 days is annexed to the Agreement.
The visa waiver covers all categories of persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all kinds of
purposes, except for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. For this latter category, each Member State and also the United Arab Emirates

Committee by the Commission, which should be assisted by the representatives of the Member States.
This Decision constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in which Ireland and the United Kingdom do not take part.
