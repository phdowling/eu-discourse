Summary

The European Parliament adopted resolution on the situation in Yemen.
The resolution was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ECR, ALDE, GUE/NGL and Greens/EFA groups.
Seriously concerned at the rapidly deteriorating situation in Yemen, Parliament urged all warring parties to end the use of violence immediately
and reaffirmed its strong support for the unity, sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Yemen.
Members condemned the destabilising and violent unilateral actions taken by the Houthis and military units loyal to ex-President Saleh as well
as the air strikes by the Saudi-led coalition and the naval blockade it has imposed on Yemen.
Parliament urged all Yemeni parties, in particular the Houthis, to work towards resolving their differences through dialogue and consultation in
order to enable a de-escalation of the crisis.
Parties are urged to refrain from targeting cultural heritage sites and buildings.
The resolution emphasised that the UN-brokered inclusive political dialogue must be a Yemeni-led process , with the intention of brokering a
consensusbased political solution to Yemens crisis. It condemned in the strongest possible terms the terrorist attacks carried out by
ISIS/Daesh against Shiite mosques in Sanaa and Saada.
Parliament also condemned the recruitment and use of children by the parties to the conflict.
Political negotiated solution: recalling the efforts of the UN and of the UN Secretary-Generals Special Envoy to Yemen, Ismail Ould Cheikh
Ahmed, to broker peace negotiations between the parties, Parliament supports Omans efforts in achieving a ceasefire between the Houthis
and forces loyal to the Government of Yemen as a first step towards a negotiated political solution. According to members, there can only be a
political, inclusive and negotiated solution to the conflict.
Parliament called for a humanitarian pause in order to allow life-saving assistance to reach the Yemeni people as a matter of urgency and
urged all parties to facilitate the urgent delivery of humanitarian assistance to all parts of Yemen, as well as rapid, safe and unhindered access
for humanitarian actors to reach people in need of humanitarian assistance. It stressed the need for coordinated humanitarian action under UN
leadership and called on the international community to contribute to the UNs revised humanitarian appeal.
International investigation: Parliament called for the independent international investigation of all alleged violations of international human
rights and international humanitarian law. It called on the VP/HR, together with the Member States, to gather support within the UN, as a
matter of urgency, for a grand international plan to secure Yemens water supply, since such a move could be essential in bringing a potential
peace process to a successful conclusion.
