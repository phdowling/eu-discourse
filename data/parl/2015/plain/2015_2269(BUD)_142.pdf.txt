2015/2269(BUD) - 19/10/2015 Commission draft budget
PURPOSE: to present Draft Amending Budget No 8 to the general budget 2015.
CONTENT: this Draft Amending Budget (DAB) No 8 for the year 2015 concerns the following:
a revision of the forecast of Traditional Own Resources (customs duties);
the budgeting of the remainder of the 2014 VAT and GNI own resources balances;
the budgeting of the 2015 VAT and GNI own resources balances;
an update of the forecast for other revenue;
a reduction of EUR 123 474 in both commitment and payment appropriation in the budget of the European Data Protection
Supervisor. On this matter, it was decided to take a prudent approach and request the necessary appropriations to cover for the most
expensive scenario, i.e. the replacement of both EDPS members (the new European Data Protection Supervisor and the Assistant).
However, the former Assistant EDPS was appointed as the new EDPS, and consequently a part of the temporary allowances will
remain unused (EUR 56 160). Furthermore the Management Board of the Translation Centre reimbursed a total of EUR 67 314 to the
EDPS this year. This extra assigned revenue was not foreseen in its estimates, and will reduce accordingly the need for fresh
appropriations.
Accordingly, the overall impact in terms of revenue, is a decrease in the GNI based contribution of EUR 9.4 billion.

2015/2269(BUD) - 10/11/2015 Council position on draft budget
On 20 October 2015, the Commission submitted to the Council draft amending budget (DAB) No 8 to the general budget for 2015.
This DAB concerns mainly the revision of the forecast of own resources that the Commission undertakes before the end of October each year.
As a result of this revision, the proposed DAB includes the following elements:
the upward revision (EUR 800 million) of the forecast of traditional own resources (customs duties);
the budgeting of the remainder of the 2014 VAT and GNI own resources balances (EUR 5.7 billion);
the budgeting of the 2015 VAT and GNI own resources balances (EUR 1.4 billion).
an update of the forecast for other revenue (EUR 1.5 billion);
a reduction of EUR 123 474 in both commitment and payment appropriations in the budget of the European Data Protection
Supervisor is also included in this DAB.

The overall impact in terms of revenue is a decrease in the GNI based contribution of EUR 9.4 billion.
On 10 November 2015, the Council adopted its position on DAB No 8/2015 as set out in the annex to the explanatory memorandum to the
Council position on DAB 8/2015 (see technical annex to the Council position).
