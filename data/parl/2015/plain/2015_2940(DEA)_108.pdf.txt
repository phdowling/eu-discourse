Summary

2015/2940(DEA) - 16/12/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament decided to raise no objections to the Commission delegated regulation of 30 October 2015 amending Delegated
Regulation (EU) No 110/2014 on the model financial regulation for public-private partnership bodies referred to in Article 209 of Regulation
(EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council.
In its resolution, Parliament recalled that Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 (The Financial Regulation) was modified by Regulation (EU,
Euratom) 2015/1929, which modified Articles 209 and 60 thereof, aligning the rules on discharge, external audit and annual reporting of the
bodies operating under Article 209 of the Financial Regulation with those of the bodies operating under Article 208.
On 30 October 2015, the Commission adopted the delegated regulation updating Delegated Regulation (EU) No 110/2014 on the model
financial regulation for public-private partnership bodies referred to in Article 209 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 (aligning it with the
corresponding provisions of Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1271/2013 applying to the bodies referred to in Article 208 of the Financial
Regulation) with a view to its application from the beginning of the financial year, ensuring a clear-cut transition to the new rules.
