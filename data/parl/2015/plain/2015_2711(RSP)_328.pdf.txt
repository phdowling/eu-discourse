Summary

2015/2711(RSP) - 21/05/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a resolution on the plight of Rohingya refugees, including the mass graves in Thailand.
The resolution was tabled by the EFDD, Greens/EFA, ALDE, ECR, GUE/NGL, EPP and S&D groups.
Recalling that on 1 and 4 May 2015 the bodies of at least 30 ethnic Rohingya Muslims were found in a suspected human trafficking camp
close to the Thai-Malaysian border, Parliament expressed its deepest concern over the plight of Rohingya refugees and the humanitarian crisis
taking place at the moment on the high seas and in the territorial waters between Myanmar, Bangladesh, Thailand and Indonesia. It called on
the Thai authorities to hold immediate, full and credible criminal investigations into the mass graves of Rohingya Muslims and, if necessary
with UN assistance, to ensure that those responsible are brought to justice. It also wanted to see the end of the complicity of certain corrupt
authorities with the criminal gangs trafficking Rohingya people and other migrants in Thailand.
Parliament welcomed the aid provided by the European Union and international organisations such as the UNHCR to the Rohingya in
Myanmar/Burma and Thailand, and the EU humanitarian assistance provided to internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Arakan/Rakhine State,
to undocumented Rohingya and vulnerable host populations in Bangladesh and to Rohingya and Bangladeshi migrants currently being held in
immigration detention centres (men) or social welfare centres (women and children) in Thailand. It called on the VP/HR to address this issue at
the highest possible political level in her contacts with Thailand and Burma/Myanmar and with other ASEAN member countries.
All countries in the region must strengthen cooperation on counter-smuggling and counter-trafficking measures and also provide Rohingya
asylum seekers at least with temporary protection, while supporting the Burmese Government in finding long-term, equitable solutions to the
underlying causes. The resolution called on the Government of Burma/Myanmar to change its policy and take all necessary measures to end
persecution of the Rohingya minority, and amend the 1982 Citizenship Law in order to give Rohingyas equal access to Burmese citizenship. In
this regard, it welcomed the long overdue statement of 18 May 2015 by the spokesperson for Aung San Suu Kyis opposition party, the
National League for Democracy (NLD), that the Government of Burma/Myanmar should grant citizenship to the Rohingya minority.
Parliament encouraged the governments of states in the region to participate in the upcoming regional meeting on the migrant situation, which
would be hosted by Thailand on 29 May 2015 in Bangkok. Stressing the important role that ASEAN played, Members welcomed the drafting of
the ASEAN Convention Against Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children (ACTIP).
Lastly, Parliament welcomed the declaration by Malaysia and Indonesia of 20 May 2015 that they would give temporary sanctuary to migrants
found at sea.
