2015/2004(INI) - 17/07/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Development adopted an own-initiative report by Eleni THEOCHAROUS (EPP, CY) on the role of local authorities in
developing countries in development cooperation.
Members considered that strategic planning at national and local level was absolutely essential to the promotion and integration of the three
main dimensions of development: the social, economic and environmental dimensions.
The report highlighted the need for translating the Commissions new guidelines on local authorities and on recognising their role as state
stakeholders into the effective implementation of European cooperation, both in terms of the 11th European Development Fund (EDF) and in
terms of the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI).
Members urged the EU to promote decentralised cooperation as a way of implementing the development framework post 2015.
To this end, they called on the Commission to (i) consider the possibility of making decentralisation a priority funding sector for its external aid
financing instruments, starting with the DCI and the EDF, and to (ii) step up efforts to include local authorities as full stakeholders in the
implementation of the 11th EDF in partner countries, regions, and in relation to sectorial and budgetary assistance.
For their part, Member States should accord an appropriate role in their development programmes to local authorities and to coordinate their
activities with those of the Commission and of other Member States.
The report stressed the importance of the following points:
ensuring a fairer transfer of resources from national level to sub-regions, towns and municipalities, ensuring also that some European
budgetary assistance be allocated to funding local authorities, and establishing a genuine political dialogue among local authorities as
part of European cooperation;
bearing in mind the role of local authorities in the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals: the MDGs revealed the
crucial role of LAs in the fight against poverty and in the delivery of community services, such as water and sanitation, primary
healthcare and education; additional resources should be allocated to strengthening the capacities of decentralised authorities so that
they could provide high-quality public services;
setting reliable targets and indicators for the Sustainable Development Goals that match the contexts, needs and worries of local
populations; the post-2015 process should provide a clear vision for an implementation of Rio+20 outcomes that recognises the role of
local authorities;
establish a renewed effective global partnership (with civil society, the private sector, etc.) with a clear definition and division of
responsibilities among partners;
strengthening partnerships with the private sector by supporting: (i) the emergence of a middle class through the promotion of private
entrepreneurship; (ii) local, micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in job creation and promoting sustainable and inclusive
economic growth, notably through public-private policies; (iii) effective implementation of accountability mechanisms and definitions of
mandatory social and environmental safeguards;
strengthening partnership with civil society: the post-2015 global development agenda needed to change the role and impact of civil
society organisations (CSOs). The report wanted to see the setting up mechanisms for regular dialogue between CSOs and Member
States;
supporting domestic accountability and capacity building: governments must be accountable both to domestic stakeholders and to the
international community. The report stressed the importance of promoting good governance at local level by promoting the principles
of accountability, transparency, participation, responsiveness and the rule of law; strong efforts needed to be made to improve the
capacity of LAs to deliver public services;
engaging indigenous people in the preparation of local and regional development and investment plans;
creating an enabling environment for the transfer of technologies through cooperation that should also include longer-term
investments;
providing in the Commissions partnership plans support for the management of a sustainable urbanisation process adopting a

territorial approach to address issues such as waste management and urban poverty
stepping up international cooperation to tackle illicit financial flows and decentralising power to combat corruption, including corruption
originating from multinational companies;
strengthening the mobilisation of resources: the report stressed the urgent need to consolidate LA capacities in partner countries in
the area of municipal taxation and budgetary planning. It asked the Commission to encourage the mobilisation of innovative sources of
financing for decentralised cooperation, and urges the European Union to hence bolster the decentralised budgets that are a
prerequisite for local development.

2015/2004(INI) - 06/10/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 556 votes to 56, with 65 abstentions, a resolution on the role of local authorities in developing countries

conditions for communities, especially in rural areas. Lastly, it called on the World Bank and the international financial institutions to
update environmental and social safeguard policies.
