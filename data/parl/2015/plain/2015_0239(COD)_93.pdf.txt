2015/0239(COD) - 18/11/2015 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to establish a common framework for the development, production and dissemination of comparable European statistics on
natural gas and electricity prices for household and final non-household customers in the EU.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an

equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: high quality, comparable, up-to-date, reliable and harmonised information on natural gas and electricity prices charged to
final customers are needed in order to draft Energy Union policy and monitor the Member States energy markets.
Up to the present date, Directive 2008/92/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council has provided a common framework for
producing, transmitting and disseminating comparable statistics on the natural gas and electricity retail prices charged to industrial customers
in the Union. National authorities collect price data for household customers on the basis of a voluntary agreement.
The growing complexity of the internal energy market make it increasingly difficult to obtain reliable and up-to-date price data for natural gas
and electricity in the absence of legally binding obligations to provide such data, in particular for the household sector.
In order to guarantee the reporting of high quality price data for the household sector and for the non-household sector , the Commission
considered that the collection of both types of data should be covered by a legal act.
The European Commission adopted on 25 February 2015 the Energy Union Package. One of the actions of the Energy Union Package under
the chapter of the internal energy market defines an analysis of energy prices and costs to be carried out in 2016 and every 2 years thereafter.
CONTENT: the proposed Regulation seeks to establish a common framework for the development, production and dissemination of
comparable European statistics on natural gas and electricity prices for household and final non-household customers in the EU. It repeals
Directive 2008/92/EC.
While applying the principle of maintaining a reduced burden on respondents and of administrative simplification, Member States shall compile
data on natural gas and electricity prices and their sub-components on network costs and taxes, levies, fees and charges as referred to in
Annexes I and II and on consumption volumes.
The system of consumption bands used by the Commission (Eurostat) in its price publications should ensure the transparency of the market
and the broad dissemination of non-confidential price data and should enable the calculation of European aggregates.
Detailed data on the breakdown of consumption bands and their respective market shares are an essential part of natural gas and electricity
price statistics.
Members States should regularly prepare quality reports and assessments of the quality of the price data.
Member States shall not be obliged to transmit data on natural gas prices for household customers to the Commission (Eurostat) if the
consumption of natural gas in the household sector is below a threshold of 1 % of national total energy consumption in the household sector.
Based on a justified request from a Member State, the Commission may grant derogations to Member States in relation to those specific
obligations for which the application of this Regulation to the national statistical system of a Member State requires major adaptations and is
likely to lead to a significant additional burden on respondents.
DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of
the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

2015/0239(COD) - 26/05/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Industry, Research and Energy adopted the report by Barbara KAPPEL (ENF, AT) on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council on European statistics on natural gas and electricity prices and repealing Directive 2008/92/EC of the
European Parliament and of the Council concerning a Community procedure to improve the transparency of gas and electricity prices charged
to industrial end-users.
The committee recommended that the European Parliaments position adopted at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure
should amend the Commission proposal as follows:
Data collection and compilation system: Members stated that the Member States shall ensure that data collection and compilation system in
place provides comprehensible and comparable high quality data that represent prices of natural gas and electricity.
Assessing the quality of data: where the Commission (Eurostat) identifies statistically significant anomalies or inconsistencies in data provided,
it may request from the national authorities an appropriate breakdown of the data as well as the calculation or evaluation methods upon which
the data provided are based, in order to assess the data and, if necessary request that any data or any information deemed to be inaccurate is
corrected or amended and then resubmitted by the Member State concerned.
Dissemination of statistics: the Commission (Eurostat) shall disseminate natural gas and electricity price statistics no later than three months
after the end of each reference period/
Delegated acts: Members deleted the provisions of the proposal empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts with a view to adjusting
the thresholds that may apply to the natural gas market.

2015/0239(COD) - 13/09/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 375 votes to 161, with 60 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council on European statistics on natural gas and electricity prices and repealing Directive 2008/92/EC of the
European Parliament and of the Council concerning a Community procedure to improve the transparency of gas and electricity prices charged
to industrial end-users.
Parliaments position, adopted at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure, amended the Commission proposal as follows:
Aim of the Regulation: it is stated that the objective of this Regulation, namely the establishment of a common legal framework for the

systematic production of European statistics on natural gas and electricity prices, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but
can rather, be better achieved at Union level.
The amended text also stated that:
this Regulation does not entail any harmonisation of the structure of prices or charges across Member States;
the collection of data on natural gas and electricity prices should follow the established practices within the European Statistical
System;
Member States should compile the data on natural gas and electricity prices by using the most appropriate sources and methods to
provide the required information;
the data on prices and conditions of sale to final customers, and the breakdown of the number of final customers by consumption in
each consumption band, should contain all the information necessary to enable the Commission to decide on appropriate measures or
proposals in relation to energy policy.
Coverage: Parliament stated that Member States shall ensure that the data collection and compilation provide comprehensible and
comparable high-quality data that are representative of their respective natural gas and electricity prices and consumption.
Member States shall not be obliged to transmit data on natural gas prices for household customers if the consumption of natural gas in the
household sector accounts for less than 1.5 % of national final energy consumption in the household sector. At least every three years, the
Commission (Eurostat) shall review which Member States are not obliged to transmit data.
Transmission of data: Member States shall provide statistics to the Commission (Eurostat) within three months of the end of the relevant
reference period. The reference periods for the data specified in Annexes I and II shall be annual (January to December) or biannual (January
to June and July to December).
Quality assurance: every three years, Member States shall provide Eurostat with a standard quality report on the data in accordance with the
quality criteria laid down in Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 on European statistics. The Commission shall assess the quality of the data provided
and shall use that assessment and an analysis of the quality reports in order to prepare and publish a report on the quality of European
statistics covered by this Regulation. It shall adopt implementing acts establishing technical quality assurance requirements regarding the
content of the quality reports.

2015/0239(COD) - 26/10/2016 Final act
PURPOSE: to establish a common framework for the production of European statistics on natural gas and electricity prices.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Regulation (EU) 2016/1952 of the European Parliament and of the Council on European statistics on natural gas and
electricity prices and repealing Directive 2008/92/EC.
CONTENT: the Regulation establishes a common framework for the development, production and dissemination of comparable European
statistics on natural gas and electricity prices for household and final non-household customers in the EU.
High-quality, comparable, up-to-date, reliable and harmonised data on natural gas and electricity prices charged to final customers are needed
in order to draft energy union policy and monitor the Member States energy markets.
The collection of data on natural gas and electricity prices charged to final customers in the household sector has so far been carried out on
the basis of a voluntary agreement.
Data sources, coverage and transmission: Member States shall compile data on natural gas and electricity prices, and their components and
sub-components concerning network costs, taxes, fees, levies and charges, and on consumption volumes, in accordance with Annexes I and
II. Data shall be sent to Eurostat on an annual or bi-annual basis.
Member States shall not be obliged to transmit data on natural gas prices for household customers if the consumption of natural gas in the
household sector accounts for less than 1.5 % of national final energy consumption in the household sector.
Quality assurance: every three years, Member States shall provide Eurostat with a standard quality report on the data in accordance with the
quality criteria laid down in Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 on European statistics. Eurostat shall assess the quality of the data provided and
shall use that assessment and an analysis of the quality reports in order to prepare and publish a report on the quality of European statistics
covered by this Regulation.
Derogations: based on a reasoned request from a Member State, the Commission should be entitled to grant derogations to that Member
State in relation to specific obligations for which the application of this Regulation to the national statistical system of that Member State
requires major adaptations or is likely to lead to a significant additional burden on respondents.
Directive 2008/92/EC is repealed with effect from 1 March 2017.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 7.12.2016.
