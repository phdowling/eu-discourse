Summary

The European Parliament adopted by 403 votes to 238 with 50 abstentions, a resolution on Commission Implementing Decision (EU)
2015/2279 of 4 December 2015 authorising the placing on the market of products containing, consisting of, or produced from genetically
modified maize NK603 × T25 (MON-ØØ6Ø3-6 × ACS-ZMØØ3-2) pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and
of the Council.
Parliament noted that the genetically modified MON-ØØ6Ø3-6 × ACS-ZMØØ3-2 maize, as described in the application presented by
Monsanto Europe S.A to the competent authority of the Netherlands, expressed the CP4 EPSPS protein which confers tolerance to glyphosate
herbicides and PAT protein which confers tolerance to glufosinate ammonium herbicides. However, the International Agency for Research on
Cancer the specialised cancer agency of the World Health Organisation classified glyphosate as probably carcinogenic to humans.
The Commission, despite the adoption on 1 December 2015 of a motion for a resolution by Parliaments Committee on the Environment, Public
Health and Food Safety in which it objected to the draft implementing decision authorising the placing on the market of products containing,
consisting of, or produced from genetically modified maize NK603 × T25, decided to disrespect the principle of sincere cooperation between
EU institutions by adopting the implementing decision on 4 December 2015.
Parliament also noted that since the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 the authorisation decisions have been adopted by the
Commission, in accordance with applicable legislation, without the support of the Member States committee opinion and that the return of the
dossier to the Commission for final decision, very much the exception for the procedure as a whole, has become the norm for decision-making
on genetically modified (GM) food and feed authorisations.
On the basis of these considerations, Members considered that:
Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/2279 exceeds the implementing powers provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003
. The Commissions decision to proceed with the adoption of Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/2279, despite its draft
having been rejected by the committee responsible before the relevant vote in plenary, is in breach of Article 13(2) of the Treaty on
European Union as regards the mutual sincere cooperation between the institutions;
any implementing decision authorising the placing on the market of products containing, consisting of, or produced from genetically
modified organisms in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 in its current non-functioning version, should be suspended
until a new regulation is adopted;
the Commission implementing decision is not consistent with Union law to provide the basis for ensuring a high level of protection of
human life and health, animal health and welfare, environment and consumer interests in relation to genetically modified food and
feed, whilst ensuring the effective functioning of the internal market.
Therefore, Parliament called on the Commission to repeal Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/2279.
Lastly, the Commission is called upon to submit a new legislative proposal on the basis of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European
Union, amending Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 and taking into account often expressed national concerns which do not relate only to issues
associated with the safety of GMOs for health or the environment.
