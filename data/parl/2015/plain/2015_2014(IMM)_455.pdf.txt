Summary

2015/2014(IMM) - 11/05/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Legal Affairs adopted the report by Heidi HAUTALA (Greens/EFA, FI) and recommended that Parliament waive the
immunity of Jérôme LAVRILLEUX (EPP, FR).
Members recalled that the Chief Prosecutor at the Paris Court of Appeal has requested the waiver of immunity of Jérôme Lavrilleux, Member

of the European Parliament, in connection with an ongoing judicial investigation into charges of forgery, use of forged documents, breach of
trust, attempted fraud and complicity in and concealment of those offences, illegal financing of an election campaign and concealment of and
complicity in that offence.
More specifically, Jérôme Lavrilleux is suspected of having taken part in a system of false invoicing for campaign expenditure. The French
judges would like, in this context, to take a custodial or semi-custodial measure against Jérôme Lavrilleux.
Given that the alleged charges are not related to the position of Jérôme Lavrilleux as a Member of the European Parliament and arise from his
former position as a deputy campaign director in the last presidential election in France, Members considered that the prosecution does not
concern opinions expressed or votes cast by Jérôme Lavrilleux as a Member of the European Parliament in the performance of his duties
within the meaning of Article 8 of Protocol No 7 on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Union.
Moreover, Parliament has found no evidence of fumus persecutionis, that is to say, a sufficiently serious and precise presumption that the
proceedings were initiated with the intention of causing political damage to the Member.
Consequently, the Legal Affairs Committee recommended that Parliament waive the immunity of Jérôme Lavrilleux.
