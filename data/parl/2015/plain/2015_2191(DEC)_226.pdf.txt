2015/2191(DEC) - 23/07/2015 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: presentation by the Commission of the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2014, as part of
the 2014 discharge procedure.
Analysis of the accounts of the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER).
CONTENT: this Commission document sets out the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2014 as
prepared on the basis of the information presented by the institutions, organisations and bodies of the EU, in accordance with Article 148 (2) of
the Financial Regulation applicable to the EU's General Budget, including the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER).
The document contains the figures on which the discharge procedure is based.
On this basis, the Financial Controller of the European Commission ensures the certification of the consolidated accounts as declared by the
institutions, agencies and bodies of the European Union.
Discharge procedure of the EU agencies: the EU Budget finances a wide range of policies and programmes throughout the EU. In accordance
with the priorities set by the European Parliament and the Council in the multi-annual financial framework (MFF), the European Commission
carries out specific programmes, activities and projects in the field with the technical support of some specialised agencies.
The consolidated annual accounts of the EU provide information on the activities of the institutions, agencies and other bodies of the EU from
a budgetary and accrual accounting perspective.
The consolidated reports on the implementation of the general budget of the EU include the budget implementation of all Institutions. Agencies
do not have a separate budget inside the EU budget; and they are partially financed by a Commission budget subsidy.
This document sets out how the Agencies spent and implemented their budget in 2014. Each agency is subject to its own discharge
procedure.
ACER: in 2014, the tasks and budget of this agency were as follows:

description of ACER's tasks: ACER, which is located in Ljubljana (SI), was set up by Regulation (EU) No 713/2009 of the European
Parliament and of the Council with a view to helping the Member States regulatory authorities in the areas of electricity and natural
gas. Its aim is to give an opinion on any of the issues relating to the purpose for which it has been established;
ACER's budget for the 2014 financial year: ACERs budget for 2014, as presented in the Commission document on the consolidated
annual accounts of the European Union, gives the following figures:
Commitment appropriations :
- committed : EUR 11 million;
- paid : EUR 10 million;
- carried-over : 0.
Payment appropriations :
- committed : EUR 16 million;
- paid : EUR 13 million;
- carried-over : EUR 3 million.
Please refer also to the final accounts of the Agency for cooperation of Energy Regulators.

2015/2191(DEC) - 08/09/2015 Court of Auditors: opinion, report
PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the Agency for Cooperation of Energy Regulators
(ACER) for the year 2013, together with the Agencys reply.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit concerned, amongst others, the annual accounts of the Agency for Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER).
Statement of assurance: pursuant to the provisions of Article 287 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the Court
has audited:
the annual accounts of the Authority, which comprise the financial statements and the reports on the implementation of the budget for
the financial year ended 31 December 2014; and
the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying those accounts.
Opinion on the reliability of the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the Agencys annual accounts present fairly, in all material respects, its
financial position as at 31 December 2014 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the
provisions of its Financial Regulation and the accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
Opinion on the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the transactions underlying the annual
accounts for the year ended 31 December 2014 are legal and regular in all material respects.
The report also makes a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of the Agency, accompanied by the latters
response. The main observations may be summarised as follows:
The Courts observations:
budgetary management: the Agency carried over 62 % of committed appropriations for operational expenditure. In October 2013,
through a budget amendment, the Agency received an additional EUR 3 million in appropriations to implement REMIT, which it carried
over to 2014. However, according to the Implementing Regulation the REMIT framework will only become operational in October
2015. According to the Court, although this will allow the Agency to finance its future REMIT-related activities, this is in contradiction
with the budgetary principle of annuality;
seat agreement: the Seat Agreement between the Agency and the Slovenian government a European School will be established in
Slovenia. However, more than four years after the agreement no European School has been set up.
The Agencys reply:
budgetary management: the Agency stated that it did its best to ensure the proper and effective implementation of REMIT, by
committing the received amended budget before the end of the year 2013 towards the required investment in infrastructure to host the
Agencys REMIT Information System (ARIS);
seat agreement: the establishment of a European School in Ljubljana has been discussed several times with the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs and the Ministry of Education. Until now, adequate schooling has been provided to the children of Agencys staff through the
public and private educational establishments.
Lastly, the Court of Auditors report contains a summary of the Authoritys activities in 2014. This is focused on the following:
Budget: EUR 10.88 million.
Activities:
network codes: two opinions on network codes (in the field of electricity);
opinions related to ENTSOs: guidelines for the European Network of Transmission System Operators, cost benefit analysis of grid
development projects;

decision on the investment request including cross-border cost allocation for the Gas Interconnection Poland-Lithuania Project of
Common Interest No 8.5 (GIPL);
REMIT-related documents: mechanisms for sharing information, market monitoring handbook;
two on-line Gas Regional initiative (GRI) and two on-line Electricity Regional Initiative (ERI) progress reports also published;
organisation of the Agencys 3rd Annual Conference REMITage: The age of REMIT? in Ljubljana.

2015/2191(DEC) - 27/01/2016 Supplementary non-legislative basic document
Having examined the revenue and expenditure accounts for the financial year 2014 and the balance sheet as at 31 December 2014 of the
Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER), as well as the Court of Auditors' report on the annual accounts of the Agency for
the financial year 2014, accompanied by the Agency's replies to the Court's observations, the Council recommended the European Parliament
to give a discharge to the Director of the Agency in respect of the implementation of the budget for the financial year 2014.
The Council welcomed the Court's opinion that, in all material respects, the Agency's annual accounts present fairly its financial position as at
31 December 2014 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions of the
Agency's Financial Regulation, and that the underlying transactions for 2014 are legal and regular in all material respects.
Nevertheless, the Council has made some observations which may be summarised as follows:
financial programming: the Council reiterated its call on the Agency to continue improving its financial programming and monitoring of
the budget implementation, in order to reduce the level of commitments carried over to the next financial year to the strict minimum, in
line with the budgetary principle of annuality. It recognised the multiannual nature of its operations, however, in particular the very high
level of carry-overs in Title III in relation to the implementation of the REMIT regulation, and the pre-financing payments made in that
regard at the end of 2014, contradict that principle.

2015/2191(DEC) - 07/04/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Derek VAUGHAN (S&D, UK) on discharge in respect of the implementation of the
budget of the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators for the financial year 2014.
The parliamentary committee calls on the European Parliament to grant the Director of the Agency discharge in respect of the implementation
of the Agencys budget for the financial year 2014.
Noting that the Court of Auditors issued a statement of assurance as to the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the
underlying transactions for the financial year 2014, Members call on Parliament to approve the closure of the Agencys accounts. They made,
however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is granted, in addition to the general
recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies:
·

Agencys financial statements: Members noted that the final budget of the Agency for the financial year 2014 was EUR 10 880 000,
representing a decrease of 8.80 % compared to 2013. The entire budget of Agency derives from the Union budget.

·

Budget and financial management: Members note that budget monitoring efforts during the financial year 2014 resulted in a budget
implementation rate of 95 %, reaching the Agencys planned target and representing a decrease of 2.53 % compared with 2013.
They note furthermore that the payment appropriations execution rate was at 69.84 %, representing an increase of 14.84 %
compared with 2013. They find that the payment appropriations execution rate is below the Agencys target of 75 %, mainly due to
the renewal or negotiation of the Agencys annual contracts towards the end of the year, as well as due to the multiannual nature of
the REMIT project.

Members also made a series of observations regarding commitments and carryovers, contract awards, recruitment and audit procedures.
They point out that, according to the Seat Agreement between the Agency and the host Member State, a European School is to be established
in the host Member State. They regret that more than four years after the entry into force of that agreement, no European School has been set
up and call on the Agency to inform the discharge authority of state of play of the negotiations.
Lastly, in respect to performance, Members recall that the Agency reviewed its system of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), by which it
introduced a distinction between performance indicators and KPIs intended to give management a clearer indication of whether the Agencys
overall objectives were being met.

2015/2191(DEC) - 28/04/2016 Final act
PURPOSE: to grant discharge to the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) for the financial year 2014.
NON LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision (EU) 2016/1486 of the European Parliament on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of
the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators for the financial year 2014.
CONTENT: with the present decision, the European Parliament grants discharge to the Director of the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy
Regulators discharge in respect of the implementation of the Agency's budget for the financial year 2014.
This decision is in line with the European Parliament's resolution adopted on 28 April 2016 and comprises a series of observations that form
an integral part of the discharge decision (please refer to the summary of the opinion of 28 April 2016).
Amongst Parliaments main observations in the resolution accompanying the discharge decision, the latter regretted that more than four years
after the entry into force of the Seat Agreement, no European School has been set up. It encouraged the Agency and the host Member State
to resolve that issue and called on the Agency to inform the discharge authority of state of play of the negotiations.

2015/2191(DEC) - 28/04/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading

2014 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Parliament adopted by 515 votes to 112 with 17 abstentions, a

and management and prevention of conflicts of interest.
It pointed out that, according to the Seat Agreement between the Agency and the host Member State, a European School is to be established

Lastly, in respect to performance, Parliament recalled that the Agency reviewed its system of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), by which it
introduced a distinction between performance indicators and KPIs intended to give management a clearer indication of whether the Agencys
overall objectives were being met.
