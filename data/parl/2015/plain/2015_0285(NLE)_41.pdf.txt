2015/0285(NLE) - 11/12/2015 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude, on behalf of the European Union, the Amending Protocol to the Agreement between the European Community and
the Principality of Andorra providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in Council Directive 2003/48/EC on taxation of savings income
in the form of interest payments.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to
follow its opinion.
BACKGROUND : following the adoption of Council Directive 2003/48/EC (the Savings Directive), and in order to preserve the level playing
field of economic operators, the EU signed Agreements with Switzerland, Andorra, Liechtenstein, Monaco and San Marino providing for
measures equivalent to those laid down in the Directive. Member States also signed agreements with the dependent territories of the United
Kingdom and the Netherlands.
The importance of automatic exchange of information as a means to combat cross-border tax fraud and tax evasion has been recognised at
international level. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) was mandated by the G20 to develop a single
global standard for automatic exchange of financial account information. The OECD Council released the Global Standard in July 2014.

Following the adoption of a proposal to update the Savings Directive, the Commission adopted on 17 June 2011 a recommendation for a
mandate to initiate negotiations with several countries, including Andorra, in order to upgrade the EUs Agreements with those countries in line
with international developments and to ensure that those countries continue to apply measures equivalent to those in the EU.
On the basis of a proposal presented by the Commission in June 2013, the Council adopted Directive 2014/107/EU amending Directive
2011/16/EU and extending the mandatory automatic exchange of information between EU tax authorities to a full range of financial items in
accordance with the Global Standard.
As Directive 2014/107/EU is generally broader in scope than Directive 2003/48/EC and provides that in cases of overlap of scope, Directive
2014/107/EU prevails, on 18 March 2015 the Commission adopted a proposal to repeal Directive 2003/48/EC.
The Commission considers it crucial to ensure that the amendment of the existing Savings Agreement with Andorra is in line with EU and
international developments.
This will be the legal basis for implementing the OCDE Global Standard on automatic exchange of information between Andorra and the EU.
CONTENT: the proposal calls upon the Council to approve, on behalf of the EU, the Amending Protocol to the Agreement between the
European Community and Andorra providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in Council Directive 2003/48/EC on taxation of
savings income in the form of interest payments.
The Amending Protocol implements the Global Standard between EU Member States and Andorra. Its introduces a new set of provisions
comprising 10 Articles, an Annex I that reflects the OECD Common Reporting Standard (CRS) which is part of the Global Standard, an Annex
II that reflects important parts of the OECD Commentaries to the Global Standard and an Annex III that lists the Competent Authorities of
Andorra and of each Member State.
The new Articles reflect the articles of the OECD Model Competent Authority agreement for the implementation of the Global Standard. They
include, inter alia:
a full set of provisions on exchange of information upon request that follows the latest text of the OECD Model Tax Convention;
a more detailed set of provisions on data protection;
an additional stage of consultation before any Member State or Andorra undertakes to suspend the Agreement.
Furthermore, the Protocol:
deals with issues on the transition from the existing Agreement to the amended Agreement, with regard to requests for information,
credits available to beneficial owners for withholding tax, final payments of withholding tax by Andorra to Member States and final
exchanges of information under the voluntary disclosure mechanism;
includes a Protocol on additional safeguards related to the exchange of information on request. The text specifies that exchanges on
the basis of a group request are not excluded.
The revised Agreement is supplemented by four Joint Declarations of the contracting parties and one Unilateral Declaration by Andorra.

2015/0285(NLE) - 29/02/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs adopted the report by Miguel VIEGAS (GUE/NGL, PT) on the proposal for a Council
decision on the conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Amending Protocol to the Agreement between the European Community
and the Principality of Andorra providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in Council Directive 2003/48/EC on taxation of savings
income in the form of interest payments.
The committee called on the European Parliament to approve the conclusion of the Amending Protocol to the Agreement.
To recall, the European Union and Andorra signed an agreement on 12 February 2016 on the automatic exchange of financial account
information, aimed at improving international tax cooperation and compliance.
Under the new agreement, the EU Member States and Andorra will automatically exchange information on the financial accounts held on their
territories by each other's residents, starting in 2018 for information collected since 1 January 2017. The aim is to address situations where a
taxpayer seeks to hide capital representing income or assets for which taxes have not been paid.
The agreement aims at ensuring that Andorra applies strengthened measures that are equivalent to the EU legal framework and that comply
with the procedures for automatic exchange of financial account information promoted by the 2014 OECD Global standard.
As a result of the new agreement, tax administrations in the Member States and in Andorra will be able to:
identify correctly and unequivocally the taxpayers concerned;
administer and enforce their tax laws in cross-border situations;
assess the likelihood of tax evasion being perpetrated;
avoid unnecessary further investigations.
The EU and Andorra have agreed for the agreement to have an entry into force on 1 January 2017, subject to the completion of their
respective internal procedures. The committee strongly urged that the agreement is concluded and ratified as soon as possible in order to
ensure a timely entry into force.

2015/0285(NLE) - 09/03/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 647 votes to 29, with 21 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a Council decision on

Principality of Andorra providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in Council Directive 2003/48/EC on taxation of savings income in

the form of interest payments.
Parliament approved the conclusion of the Amending Protocol to the Agreement.
To recall, the European Union and Andorra signed an agreement on 12 February 2016 on the automatic exchange of financial account
information, aimed at improving international tax cooperation and compliance.

2015/0285(NLE) - 20/09/2016 Final act
PURPOSE: to approve the conclusion of an Agreement between the EU and Andorra aiming to improve tax compliance by private savers.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Council Decision (EU) 2016/1751 on the conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Amending Protocol to
the Agreement between the European Community and the Principality of Andorra providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in
Council Directive 2003/48/EC on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments.
CONTENT: the Council approved, on behalf of the European Union, the Amending Protocol to the Agreement between the European
Community and the Principality of Andorra providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in Council Directive 2003/48/EC on taxation of
savings income in the form of interest payments.
The Amending Protocol to the Agreement between the European Community and the Principality of Andorra was signed on 12 February 2016.
It aligns the Agreement with the latest developments at international level concerning automatic exchange of information, namely with the
Global Standard for automatic exchange of financial account information in tax matters developed by the Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD).
The text of the Agreement, as amended by the Amending Protocol, is the legal basis for implementing the OCDE Global Standard on
automatic exchange of information between Andorra and the EU. It will extend the automatic exchange of information on financial accounts in
order to prevent taxpayers from hiding capital representing income or assets for which tax has not been paid.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 21.10.2016.
