Summary

2015/2865(RSP) - 27/10/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 493 to 145 votes with 25 abstentions a resolution on emission measurements in the automotive sector.
Recalling the notice of violation of the pollution rules issued against Volkswagen in the United States, Parliament strongly condemned any
fraud by automobile manufacturers and urged companies to take full responsibility for their actions and to cooperate fully with the authorities in
any investigations. It demanded that where defeat devices were found, Member State authorities take all necessary action to remedy the
situation and apply the appropriate sanctions in accordance with Directive 2007/46/EC and Regulation (EC) No 715/2007. It recalled that the
automotive industry was one of the key contributors to growth and innovation, and contributed to employment in a significant number of
Member States. Unless decisive actions were taken, the present scandal risked undermining the reputation and competiveness of the whole
sector.
Consumers and employees: Members deplored the fact that millions of consumers had been deceived and misled by false information
regarding emissions from their vehicles. They emphasised its solidarity with the employees concerned, and were worried about the impact
along the supply chain, especially on SMEs, which currently were innocently facing huge challenges caused by the fraud. Members stressed
that employees should not ultimately be the ones who pay the price for emission measurement manipulation.
Investigations: Parliament welcomed the investigations being undertaken in several Member States and other countries globally regarding
vehicle emissions test results manipulation. It supported the Commissions call to national surveillance authorities to proceed with extensive
checks on a wide variety of makes and models of vehicles. Any such investigation should involve the Commission and be conducted in a
transparent and effective manner. Members demanded that the Commission report back to Parliament on the results of these investigations, in
writing, by 31 March 2016.
Real Driving Emissions test cycle: Parliament urged the Commission to adopt and implement the new Real Driving Emissions test cycle
without any further delay, and to bring it into force for regulatory purposes. It noted that according to the Commissions current plans, the Real
Driving Emissions tests would be used only for NOx emissions, but Members called for the RDE tests to be implemented for all pollutants.
Members also welcomed the report on the reduction of pollutant emissions from road vehicles adopted by Parliaments Committee on the
Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on 23 September 2015, and in particular the requirement that the Commission introduce a real
driving emissions test for all vehicles type-approved or registered from 2015 to ensure the effectiveness of emission control systems.
Type-approval: recalling that the current EU type-approval regime did not allow the Commission or other Member States authorities to
reassess vehicles type approvals or certificates of conformity, to recall vehicles or to suspend their placement on the market if they were
type-approved by another Member State, Parliament called on the Commission to redesign the current regime in order to guarantee that type
approvals and certificates by national competent authorities could be checked independently and reassessed by the Commission, if
appropriate. It stated that it was of utmost importance that the Commission and all Member State competent authorities had the right to
reassess type approval and certificates of conformity, to require recalls and stop the placing on the market of vehicles when they had evidence
of non-compliance with the EU emissions limit values under the Euro 5 and 6 Regulation or any other requirement provided for by the
type-approval regime.
Parliament also considered that the upcoming review of the Type Approval Framework Directive must consider expanding and specifying the
conformity-of-production requirements in order to ensure that a sufficient and representative sample of new models taken off production lines
at random are tested on an annual basis, using RDE tests to check their compliance with EU pollutant and CO2 limit values. Furthermore,
Members wanted to see improved in-service testing of vehicles already in use on the road , also on the basis of the RDE procedure, in order to
verify the in-service conformity of vehicles at different mileages as required under the regulation. They called for the improvement of on-road
surveillance through periodic technical inspections to identify and repair vehicles which are found not to be in compliance with EU law.
EU-level surveillance authority: Parliament called for consideration to be given to the establishment of an EU-level surveillance authority as
part of the need to significantly strengthening the current EU type-approval regime, including greater EU oversight, in particular as regards the
market surveillance, coordination and follow-up regime for vehicles sold in the Union, the power to require Member States to launch control
procedures based on evidence, and the ability to adopt appropriate measures in the event of breaches of EU law.
In-lab testing: lastly, Parliament called on national authorities to show no tolerance towards vehicle testing optimisation, whereby practices
such as the over-inflation of tyres, the removal of side-mirrors, taping up of gaps between body panels to reduce aerodynamic drag, the use of
special engine and gearbox lubricants that were otherwise not used in engines, the removal of auxiliary equipment such as stereos, and
testing at the maximum allowed ambient temperature are common, thus unacceptably accentuating the difference between in-lab testing and
the consumers experience on the road.
