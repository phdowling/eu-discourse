2015/0210(NLE) - 16/09/2015 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: accession of Croatia to the Convention on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests as well as its Protocols.
PROPOSED ACT: Recommendation for a Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to
follow its opinion.
BACKGROUND: the Act concerning the conditions of accession of Croatia to the European Union has introduced a simplified system for the
accession of Croatia to the conventions (and protocols) concluded by the Member States on the basis of Art. 34 TEU (previously Art. K.3
TEU). It is provided that the Act of Accession provides that, to that effect, the Council shall adopt a decision in order to determine the date on
which these conventions shall enter into force for Croatia and to make all the necessary adjustments to these conventions required by reason
of the accession of the new Member State (which would include, in any event, the adoption of the conventions in the Croatian language, so
that these versions can be "equally authentic"). The Council shall act on a recommendation of the Commission, after consulting the European
Parliament.
The Convention on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests, signed on 26 July 1995 and drawn up on the basis of
Article K.3 of the Treaty on European Union, entered into force on 17 October 2002. It was complemented by the Protocol of 27 September
1996 and the Protocol of 29 November 1996, then by the Second Protocol of 19 June 1997.
CONTENT: under this present proposal, the Commission recommended that the Council adopt a decision concerning the access of Croatia to
the Convention on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests as well as its Protocols.

2015/0210(NLE) - 01/02/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs adopted the report by Tomá ZDECHOVSKÝ (EPP, CZ) on the recommendation for
a Council decision concerning the accession of Croatia to the Convention of 26 July 1995, drawn up on the basis of Article K.3 of the Treaty on
European Union, on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests, as well as its protocols.
The committee recommended the European Parliament to approve the Commission proposal.
To recall, the 2011 Accession Treaty of the Republic of Croatia has introduced a simplified system for the accession of Croatia to the

conventions (and protocols) concluded by the Member States on the basis of Art. 34 TEU (previously Art. K.3 TEU).
Article 3(4) and 3(5) of the Act provides that Croatia accedes to these conventions and protocols by virtue of the Act of Accession.
Article 3(5) of the Act of Accession provide that, to that effect, the Council shall adopt a decision in order to determine the date on which these
conventions shall enter into force for Croatia and to make all the necessary adjustments to these conventions required by reason of the
accession of the new Member State (which would include, in any event, the adoption of the conventions in the Croatian language, so that
these versions can be "equally authentic"). The Council shall act on a recommendation of the Commission, after consulting the European
Parliament.

2015/0210(NLE) - 25/02/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 599 votes to 26, with 26 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the recommendation for a Council
decision concerning the accession of Croatia to the Convention of 26 July 1995, drawn up on the basis of Article K.3 of the Treaty on
European Union, on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests, as well as its Protocols.
In line with its Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, Parliament approved the Commission recommendation.
