2015/2174(DEC) - 27/01/2016 Supplementary non-legislative basic document
Having examined the revenue and expenditure accounts for the financial year 2014 and the balance sheet as at 31 December 2014 of the
European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA), as well as the Court of Auditors' report on the annual accounts of the Agency for the financial year
2014, accompanied by the Agency's replies to the Court's observations, the Council recommended the European Parliament to give a

discharge to the Executive Director of the Agency in respect of the implementation of the budget for the financial year 2014.
The implementation of the budget of the Agency is such as to allow a discharge to be given in respect of that implementation. The Council
welcomed the fact that the observations in the Court of Auditors' report in relation to the financial year 2014 do not call for any comments.

2015/2174(DEC) - 07/04/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Derek VAUGHAN (S&D, UK) on discharge in respect of the implementation of the
budget of the European Maritime Safety Agency for the financial year 2014.
The parliamentary committee calls on the European Parliament to grant the Executive Director of the Agency discharge in respect of the
implementation of the Agencys budget for the financial year 2014.
Noting that the Court of Auditors issued a statement of assurance as to the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the
underlying transactions for the financial year 2014, Members call on Parliament to approve the closure of the Agencys accounts. They made,
however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is granted, in addition to the general
recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies:
·

Agencys financial statements: Members note the final budget of the European Maritime Safety Agency for the financial year 2014
was EUR 52 403 276, representing a decrease of 9.37 % compared to 2013.

·

Budget and financial management: Members note that the budget monitoring efforts during the financial year 2014 resulted in a
budget implementation rate of 94.78 %.

Members also made a series of observations regarding commitments and carryovers, preventing and managing conflicts of interest, as well as
on contract award, recruitment and internal audit procedures.
Members note with satisfaction that the Agency actively sought potential synergies with other agencies. They note in particular that the Agency
is sharing its Business Continuity Facility in Madrid with the Joint Undertaking for ITER and the Development of Fusion Energy and with the
European Fisheries Control Agency. It also cooperates with the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction in the area of
human resources and ICT.
Lastly, Members highlight the Agencys contribution to maritime safety, the prevention of ship pollution in Europe, and the assistance provided
to Member States and the Commission under international and Union law. They deplore the fact that, while extending its competences, staff
reduction and budgetary cuts became applicable in 2014. They welcome and encourage the Agency's collaboration with other European
Agencies regarding the refugee crisis and reaffirm that the Agency has to be given the financial, material and human resources it needs to
perform its tasks effectively, including when dealing with critically important activities outside its mandate, that is, its contribution in the form of
know-how and operational support, through its staff, to managing the refugees crisis.

2015/2174(DEC) - 28/04/2016 Final act
PURPOSE: to grant discharge to the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) in respect of the Agencys budget for the financial year 2014.
NON LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision (EU) 2016/1540 of the European Parliament on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of
the European Maritime Safety Agency for the financial year 2014.
CONTENT: with the present decision, the European Parliament grants discharge to the Director of the European Maritime Safety Agency for
the implementation of its budget for the financial year 2014.
This decision is in line with the European Parliament's resolution adopted on 28 April 2016 and comprises a series of observations that form
an integral part of the discharge decision (please refer to the summary of the opinion of 28 April 2016).
Amongst Parliaments main observations in the resolution accompanying the discharge decision, it noted that the Agency actively sought
potential synergies with other agencies in particular by sharing its business continuity facility in Madrid with the Joint Undertaking for ITER and
the Development of Fusion Energy and with the European Fisheries Control Agency. It called on the Agency to enhance its procedures and
practices aimed at contributing to a results-oriented discharge process.

2015/2174(DEC) - 28/04/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament decided to grant discharge to the Executive Director of the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) in respect of
the implementation of its budget for the financial year 2014. The vote on the decision on discharge covers the closure of the accounts (in
accordance with Annex V, Article 5 (1)(a) to Parliaments Rules of Procedure.
Noting that the Court of Auditors has stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the Agencys annual accounts for the financial year
2014 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Parliament adopted by 510 votes to 116 with 11 abstentions, a
resolution containing a series of recommendations, which form an integral part of the decision on discharge and which add to the general
recommendations set out in the resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies:
Agencys financial statements: Parliament noted the final budget of the European Maritime Safety Agency for the financial year 2014
was EUR 52 403 276, representing a decrease of 9.37 % compared to 2013.
Budget and financial management: Parliament noted that the budget monitoring efforts during the financial year 2014 resulted in a
budget implementation rate of 94.78 %.
Parliament also made a series of observations regarding commitments and carryovers, preventing and managing conflicts of interest,
as well as on contract award, recruitment and internal audit procedures.

Performance: Parliament welcomed the fact that the Agency is developing medium-term objectives and action plans to improve its
performance towards the achievement of the strategic goals set in the 5-year strategy adopted by the Administrative Board in 2013. It
regretted, in this context that the multi-annual financial framework of the Union for the period 2014-2020, in clear contrast with the new
legal remit for the Agency, may impose an adaptation of the strategy of the Agency due to financial constraints.
Parliament noted with satisfaction that the Agency actively sought potential synergies with other agencies. It noted in particular that the Agency
is sharing its Business Continuity Facility in Madrid with the Joint Undertaking for ITER and the Development of Fusion Energy and with the
European Fisheries Control Agency. It also cooperates with the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction in the area of
human resources and ICT.
Lastly, Parliament highlighted the Agencys contribution to maritime safety, the prevention of ship pollution in Europe, and the assistance
provided to Member States and the Commission under international and Union law. It deplored the fact that, while extending its competences,
staff reduction and budgetary cuts became applicable in 2014. It welcomed and encouraged the Agency's collaboration with other European
Agencies regarding the refugee crisis and reaffirm that the Agency has to be given the financial, material and human resources it needs to
perform its tasks effectively, including when dealing with critically important activities outside its mandate, that is, its contribution in the form of
know-how and operational support, through its staff, to managing the refugees crisis.
