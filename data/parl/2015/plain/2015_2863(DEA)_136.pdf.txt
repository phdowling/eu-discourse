2015/2863(DEA) - 20/01/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 355 votes to 308, with 44 abstentions, a resolution objecting to Commission Delegated Regulation of 25
September 2015 supplementing Regulation (EU) No 609/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the specific
compositional and information requirements for processed cereal-based food and baby food.
The reasons which motivated Parliaments objection to the Commission delegated regulation are the following:
Obesity: Parliament considered that the delegated regulation does not contain sufficient measures to protect infants and young
children against obesity and that the allowed maximum sugar level should be substantially lowered in line with WHO
recommendations. The delegated regulation allows 30 % of the energy in baby foods to be provided by sugar (7.5 g sugar/100 kcal is
equivalent to 30 kcal from sugar in 100 kcal energy). These are contrary to all health advice from the WHO which recommends
limiting the intake of free sugars to less than 10 % of total energy intake, with a further reduction to less than 5 % of total energy intake
for additional health benefits.
Emerging technologies: Parliament considered that, in line with the precautionary principle, emerging technologies such as GMOs and
nanotechnologies, whose long-term risks are not known, should be prohibited in processed cereal-based food and baby food.
Labelling: taking the view that, in consideration of global public health recommendations, including World Health Assembly (WHA)
resolution 63.23, the WHA Global Strategy on Infant and Young Child Feeding and the global impact of exports from the Union to third
countries, the labelling and marketing of processed baby foods should make it clear that these products are not adequate for use by
infants of less than six months of age and should not undermine the six-month exclusive breastfeeding recommendation. Therefore,
the labelling and marketing should be revised in line with WHA recommendations for foods for infants and young children.
Transparency: in order to build public trust in Union institutions and EU decision making, Parliament is of the opinion that the list of
bilateral meetings (including the dates thereof and participants) which the Commission has held with interested parties during the
process of drafting the delegated regulation should be made public.
