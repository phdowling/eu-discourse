Summary

2015/2339(IMM) - 26/04/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Legal Affairs adopted the report by Gilles LEBRETON (ENF, FR) in which it recommended the European Parliament to
waive the immunity of Boles?aw G. PIECHA (ECR, PL).
Members stated that the Prosecutor-General of the Republic of Poland forwarded a request from the Polish General Inspector of Road
Transport for waiver of the immunity of Boles?aw G. Piecha concerning an offence under Article 92a of the Code of Petty Offences of 20 May

1971 in conjunction with Article 20(1) of the Road Traffic Act of 20 June 1997. In particular, the alleged offence involves exceeding the
permitted speed limit in a built-up area.
Members recalled that Articles 105(2) and 108 of the Constitution of the Republic of Poland state that a deputy or a senator shall not be
subject to criminal accountability without the consent of the Sejm or of the Senate respectively.
Recalling that the alleged offence took place before Boles?aw G. Piecha became a Member of the European Parliament and that it has no
direct or obvious bearing on Boles?aw G. Piechas exercise of his duties at the European Parliament, Members called on the European
Parliament to waive its parliamentary immunity.

2015/2339(IMM) - 28/04/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament decided to waive the immunity of Boles?aw G. PIECHA (ECR, PL).
To recall, the Prosecutor-General of the Republic of Poland forwarded a request from the Polish General Inspector of Road Transport for
waiver of the immunity of Boles?aw G. Piecha concerning an offence under Article 92a of the Code of Petty Offences of 20 May 1971 in
conjunction with Article 20(1) of the Road Traffic Act of 20 June 1997. In particular, the alleged offence involves exceeding the permitted speed
limit in a built-up area.
The alleged offence took place before Boles?aw G. Piecha became a Member of the European Parliament and Parliament stated that it has no
direct or obvious bearing on Boles?aw G. Piechas exercise of his duties at the European Parliament.
Moreover, Boles?aw G. Piecha sent a statement to the Polish General Inspectorate of Road Transport, in response to the report of the offence
by the Inspector General of that Inspectorate, in which he agreed to pay the fine for the offence under Article 92a of the Code of Petty
Offences. Therefore, in this case it is difficult to establish evidence of fumus persecutionis, that is to say, a sufficiently serious and precise
suspicion that the request has been made with the intention of causing political damage to the Member concerned.
Under these conditions, Parliament decided to waive the immunity of Boles?aw G. Piecha.
