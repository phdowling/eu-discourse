2015/2201(DEC) - 23/07/2015 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: presentation by the Commission of the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2014, as part of
the 2014 discharge procedure.
Analysis of the accounts of the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen 2 Joint Undertaking (FCH 2 Joint Undertaking).
CONTENT: this Commission document sets out the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2014 as
prepared on the basis of the information presented by the institutions, organisations and bodies of the EU, in accordance with Article 148 (2) of
the Financial Regulation applicable to the EU's General Budget, including the FCH 2 Joint Undertaking.
The document contains the figures on which the discharge procedure is based.
On this basis, the Financial Controller of the European Commission ensures the certification of the consolidated accounts as declared by the
institutions, agencies and bodies of the European Union.
Discharge procedure of the EU Joint Undertakings: the EU Budget finances a wide range of policies and programmes throughout the EU. In
accordance with the priorities set by the European Parliament and the Council in the multi-annual financial framework (MFF), the European
Commission carries out specific programmes, activities and projects in the field with the technical support of some specialised agencies.
The consolidated annual accounts of the EU provide information on the activities of the institutions, agencies and other bodies of the EU from
a budgetary and accrual accounting perspective.
The consolidated reports on the implementation of the general budget of the EU include the budget implementation of all Institutions. Agencies
and Joint Undertakings (JUs) do not have a separate budget inside the EU budget ; and they are partially financed by a Commission budget
subsidy.
This document sets out how the JUs spent and implemented their budget in 2014. Each agency is subject to its own discharge procedure.

FCH 2 JU: in 2014, the tasks and budget of the Joint Undertaking were as follows:
description of the tasks of the Joint Undertaking: the FCH 2 Joint Undertaking, located in Brussels (BE), was set up by Council
Regulation (EU) No 559/2014 until 31 December 2024. The FCH 2 Joint Undertaking shall replace and succeed the FCH Joint
Undertaking as established by Regulation (EC) No 521/2008. It aims to reduce the production cost of fuel cell systems to be used in
transport applications, while increasing their lifetime to levels which can compete with conventional technologies;
accounts of the JU: The ownership participation at year-end is as follows 70.85% in FCH 2. In order to take into account the duration
of Horizon 2020, calls for proposals by the FCH 2 Joint Undertaking shall be launched at the latest by 31 December 2020.
Please also consult the final accounts of FCH 2 Joint Undertaking.

2015/2201(DEC) - 06/10/2015 Court of Auditors: opinion, report
PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen 2 (FCH 2) for the financial
year 2014, together with the Joint Undertakings reply.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit concerned, amongst others, the annual accounts of the FCH 2 Joint Undertaking (fuel cells and hydrogen technologies).
Statement of assurance: pursuant to the provisions of Article 287 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the Court
has audited:
the annual accounts of the FCH 2, which comprise the financial statements and the reports on the implementation of the budget for
the financial year ended 31 December 2014;
the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying those accounts.
Opinion on the reliability of the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the Joint Undertakings annual accounts present fairly, in all material respects,
its financial position as at 31 December 2014, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with
the provisions of its financial rules and the rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
Opinion on the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the transactions underlying the annual
accounts for the year ended 31 December 2014 are, in all material respects, legal and regular.
The audit also revealed the following points:
budgetary management: the budgetary implementation rate for commitment appropriations ranged between 90 % and 100 % for most
Joint Undertakings including FCH 2 and the rate for payment appropriations ranged between 74 % and 100 %;
procurement: the Court notes that with regard to calls for proposals, the final rate of appropriations committed achieved a figure
between 90 % and 100 %, including FCH 2.
Cross-cutting remarks for all the Joint undertakings: the monitoring and reporting of research results is laid down in the Seventh Framework
Programme (FP7). In the grant agreements signed with members and other beneficiaries, the Joint Undertakings have included specific
provisions governing intellectual property rights and the dissemination of research activities and results. The implementation of these
provisions is monitored by the Joint Undertakings at different stages of the funded projects and significant progress has been achieved in
2014. However, in order to meet the requirements of Horizon 2020 and to better contribute to the dissemination of FP7 research results, the
Court considers that cooperation between the Joint Undertakings and the Commission must be developed as much as possible with special
regard to the further integration of some of the Joint Undertakings data into the Commissions systems.
The Court also indicates that there is room to improve procedures, in particular in the implementation of the ex-post audit strategy, and
cooperation with the Commission as regards the integration of the research results.
Replies of the Joint Undertaking: the Joint Undertaking welcomes the positive opinion of the European Court of Auditors on FCH 2 Joint
Undertakings annual accounts and underlying transactions for the financial year 2014 and takes note of the comments.
With regard to the activities of the Joint Undertaking in 2014, the report refers to the Joint Undertakings latest available annual activity report
for 2014 available at the following address: http://www.fch.europa.eu/page/documents.
It should be noted that the budget for FCH 2 was EUR 112 million.

2015/2201(DEC) - 27/01/2016 Supplementary non-legislative basic document
Having examined the revenue and expenditure accounts for the financial year 2014 and the balance sheet as at 31 December 2014 of the
Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking and the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen 2 Joint Undertaking, as well as the Court of Auditors' report on
the annual accounts of the Joint Undertaking for the financial year 2014, accompanied by the Joint Undertaking's replies to the Court's
observations, the Council recommended the European Parliament to give a discharge to the Executive Director of the successor Joint
Undertaking in respect of the implementation of the budget of the Joint Undertaking for the financial year 2014.
The Council recalled that the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen 2 Joint Undertaking has replaced and succeeded the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint
Undertaking and should be given to the Executive Director of the successor Joint Undertaking.
The Council welcomed the Court's opinion that, in all material respects, the Joint Undertaking's annual accounts present fairly its financial
position as at 31 December 2014 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions

of the Joint Undertaking's Financial Rules, and that the underlying transactions for 2014 are legal and regular in all material respects.
Nevertheless, the Council made the following observation:
research results: the Council took note of the recommendation to improve the reporting and dissemination of research results and
called on the successor Joint Undertaking to enhance its cooperation with the Commission in this regard.

2015/2201(DEC) - 07/04/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Marian-Jean MARINESCU (EPP, RO) on discharge in respect of the
implementation of the budget of the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen (FCH) Joint Undertaking for the financial year 2014.
The parliamentary committee calls on the European Parliament to grant the joint undertakings Executive Director discharge in respect of the
implementation of the joint undertakings budget for the financial year 2014.
Noting that the Court of Auditors issued a statement of assurance as to the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the
underlying transactions for the financial year 2014, Members call on Parliament to approve the closure of the joint undertakings accounts.
They made, however, a number of recommendations that need to be taken into account when the discharge is granted. They may be
summarised as follows:
General remark: Members note that the Court of Auditors' report is based on too many general remarks to the detriment of viable,
specific ones. They therefore call for an audit with a sharper focus on the annual financial performance, on the implementation status
of multiannual projects (including a clear presentation of the implementation of the budget for the respective year and for previous
years) and on the results and their implementation. They note that the Institutions and Bodies are required to produce each year a
Report on Budgetary and Financial Management and that the information provided by the Joint Undertaking in this report lacked
harmonisation and was often incomplete. They call on the Commission to provide guidance as to the nature and content of the report.
Budget and financial management: Members note that FCH's final budget for the financial year 2014 included commitment
appropriations of EUR 112 064 990 and payment appropriations of EUR 95 952 176. They point out that the budget execution by year
end for all fund sources reached 98.48 % as regards commitment appropriations and 74.52 % in terms of payment executions. They
consider that, in the absence of a clear separation between FP7 and Horizon 2020, implementation-related information, those
indicators do not assure a real evaluation of performance. They call on the Court to include in future reports information regarding,
separately, the execution of the budget under FP7 and Horizon 2020. They also regret the absence of information regarding in-kind
and cash contributions.
Lastly, Members issue a series of observations on the undertaking's legal framework, and procurement and internal control procedures.
