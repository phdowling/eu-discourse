2015/0057(NLE) - 05/03/2015 Initial legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude the Agreement between the European Union and Grenada on the short-stay visa waiver.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council amended Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing
the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders of the Member States and those whose
nationals are exempt from that requirement. The Regulation was adopted on 20 May 2014 and entered into force on 9 June 2014.
In July 2014, the Commission presented a Recommendation to the Council to authorise it to start negotiations on visa waiver agreements with
each of the following 17 countries: Dominica, Grenada, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the
Grenadines, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, the United Arab Emirates and Vanuatu. On 9
October 2014, the Council addressed negotiating directives to the Commission. The negotiations on the visa waiver agreement with Grenada
were opened on 12 November 2014 in Brussels. The agreement was initialled by the chief negotiators on 9 December 2014 . The Commission
considers that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives were attained and that the draft visa waiver agreement is
acceptable to the Union.
CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve the Agreement between the European Union andGrenada on the short-stay
visa waiver.

The content of the agreement may be summarised as follows:
Purpose and duration of stay: the agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of
Grenada when travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period.
The agreement takes into account the situation of the Member States that do not yet apply the Schengen acquis in full. As long as they are not
part of the Schengen area without internal borders, the visa waiver confers a right for the nationals of Grenada to stay for 90 days in any
180-day on the territory of each of those Member States (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania), independently of the period calculated for
the whole Schengen area.
A provision has been included in the agreement stating that Grenada may suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all the
Member States of the European Union and that the Union may also only suspend or terminate the agreement in respect of all of its Member
States.
Scope: the visa waiver covers all categories of persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all
kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. For this latter category, each Member State and also Grenada remain
free to impose the visa requirement on the citizens of the other Party in accordance with the applicable Union or national law.
The Member States and Grenada reserve the right to refuse entry into and short stay in their territories if one or more of these conditions are
not met.
Territorial application: in the case of France and the Netherlands, the visa waiver would entitle nationals of Grenada to stay only in those
Member States? European territories.
The provisions of the Agreement do not apply to the United Kingdom and Ireland.
The Agreement establishes a Joint Committee for the management of the Agreement, which shall adopt its rules of procedure.

2015/0057(NLE) - 28/04/2015 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude the Agreement between the European Union and Grenada.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: the Commission negotiated on behalf of the European Union an agreement with Grenada on the short-stay visa waiver.
In accordance with a Council Decision, the Agreement has been signed and is applied on a provisional basis.
It is now necessary to approve the Agreement on behalf of the EU.
CONTENT: the Council is invited to approve the Agreement between the European Union and Grenada on the short-stay visa waiver.
For further details of the Agreement, please refer to the summary of the initial Commission proposal dated 5.3.2015 .
Territorial provisions: the provisions of the future Agreement shall not apply to the United Kingdom and Ireland.
The Agreement sets up a Joint Committee of experts for the management of the Agreement. The Union is to be represented within that Joint
Committee by the Commission, which should be assisted by the representatives of the Member States.

2015/0057(NLE) - 16/11/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs adopted the report by Mariya GABRIEL (EPP, BG) on the draft Council decision on
the conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Agreement between the European Union and Grenada on the short-stay visa waiver.
The committee recommended the European Parliament to give its consent to the conclusion of the Agreement.
To recall, the Agreement signed on 28 May 2015 provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of
Grenada when travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period. The visa waiver
covers all categories of persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all kinds of purposes, except
for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity.
The report is accompanied by a short justification stating that this Agreement on the waiver of short-stay visas simultaneously represents a
culmination of the deepening of relations between the European Union and Grenada which is politically highly significant in the context of the
Cotonou Agreement and is an additional way of stepping up economic and cultural relations and intensifying political dialogue on various
issues, including human rights and fundamental freedoms.
In the economic sphere, Grenada, whose economy is heavily dependent on exports of bananas and spices, has taken measures to
transform and substantially diversify the economy, in particular with tourism and construction gaining ground. Like all small island
developing countries, Grenada faces many challenges because of its size, remoteness from markets. Visa liberalisation will simplify
travel and make it possible to dynamise tourism and impart fresh impetus to trade.
As regards the political and institutional situation, Grenada is a stable, democratic country, which, like the European Union, defends
the values and principles of democracy, good governance and respect for human rights and the rule of law. The country stresses its
commitment to human rights and is committed to improving its human rights machinery. Recent proposals for constitutional reform to
promote and protect human rights, and the legislative reforms which have been undertaken, particularly the adoption of the new law
on family violence and a new law on child protection. The conclusion of this agreement will make it possible to step up cooperation
and intensify dialogue in many fields, including that of human rights.

With regard to mobility, with the rate of refusal of visas being low, the country does not present any threat in terms either of irregular
migration or of security and public policy.
As regards the implementation and monitoring of the agreement, the rapporteur:
called on the Commission to observe any developments in relation to the criteria regarding clandestine immigration, public policy and
security, including, considerations relating to human rights and fundamental freedoms;
urged the Commission and the authorities of Grenada to ensure full reciprocity of the visa waiver, which should permit equal treatment
of all citizens, particularly all citizens of the Union;
encouraged the Commission to review the composition of the joint management committees for future agreements to enable the
European Parliament to be involved in the work of these committees.
Lastly, the rapporteur also queried the practice of signing visa waiver agreements and applying them provisionally before the European
Parliament has approved them, a practice which is liable to reduce Parliaments room for manoeuvre.

2015/0057(NLE) - 15/12/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 578 votes to 66 with 24 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the draft Council decision on the
conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Agreement between the European Union and Grenada on the short-stay visa waiver.

the Agreement.
The Agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of Grenada when travelling to the
territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period. The visa waiver covers all categories of
persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of
carrying out a paid activity.
