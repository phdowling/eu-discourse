Summary

2015/2152(REG) - 09/09/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament decided to append the following interpretation to Rule 130(3) of the Rules of Procedure concerning the questions for
written answer:
The expression "by way of exception" is to be interpreted as meaning that the additional question concerns a matter of urgency and that the
submission of that question cannot wait until the following month. Furthermore, the number of questions tabled under the second
subparagraph of paragraph 3 must be smaller than the norm of five questions per month.
