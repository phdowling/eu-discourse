Summary

2015/2652(RSP) - 20/05/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 507 votes to 115, with 37 abstentions, a resolution on the outbreak of Xylella fastidiosa affecting olive
trees.
The resolution was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ECR and ALDE groups.
Members recalled that the Xylella fastidiosa is a highly dangerous immediate threat to the production in southern Europe of certain crops,
including olive, almond and peach trees and ornamental plants. It is a potential threat to vineyards, citrus trees and other crops and could lead
to unprecedented and devastating losses, with dramatic economic, environmental and social consequences.
The strain infecting olive trees in the Apulia region is different from the isolates causing disease in grapevine or citrus in other parts of the
world.
Noting that the implementing decisions taken before April 2015 by the Commission focused mainly on internal actions to fight the outbreak,
Members stressed that they did not include strong measures to prevent the entry of the disease into the EU from third countries.
Therefore, Parliament called on the Commission to take targeted measures against Xylella fastidiosa in order to prevent the import of infected
material into the EU.
They regretted the fact that very often the Commission does not react quickly enough to prevent the entry into the EU of plant diseases from
third countries. It considered that, especially in view of the onset of summer, the Commission should take effective measures to avoid the
spread of Xylella fastidiosa within the EU, in particular by targeting the crops most at risk, while not neglecting other crops that could also be
seriously affected by the disease.
Further measures called for include:
compensating producers for eradication measures and loss of revenue;
identifying incentives for producers implementing preventive measures and ensuring that sufficient financial and human resources are
available to implement the relevant strategies;
promoting intensified research efforts on Xylella fastidiosa;
running information campaigns in potentially affected areas of the EU;
warning travellers about the risks of introducing infected plants from countries affected by Xylella fastidiosa into the EU.
The Commission is called upon to draft, in a transparent manner, comprehensive guidelines for the implementation of preventive and disease
control measures, with clear indications of their scope and duration that can be used as a support tool by the competent authorities and
services in the Member States.
Lastly, Parliament called on the Commission to establish an annual report on the measures taken on this issue.
