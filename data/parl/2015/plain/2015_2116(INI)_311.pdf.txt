2015/2116(INI) - 01/07/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs adopted the own initiative report by Renate WEBER (ADLE, RO) on the application of
Council Directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation
(Employment Equality Directive). Whilst welcoming the fact that almost all Member States have included the general principle of equal
treatment on specific grounds of discrimination in their constitutions, Members regretted that only a few Member States have systematically
ensured that all existing legal texts are in line with the principle of equal treatment , and even fewer implement them systematically.
In particular, they regretted the increase in experiences of discrimination and harassment, including at the workplace and especially with
regard to gender, nationality, social background, disability, discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity, ethnic
origin, and religion, particularly with regard to Muslim women and LGBTI people. Members called on the Commission to include a specific
focus on all types of discrimination when monitoring the implementation of Directive 2000/78/EC, and to speed up the adoption of the EU
horizontal anti-discrimination directive proposed by the Commission in 2008, which was voted for by Parliament.
Members noted that non-discrimination in the field of occupation and employment is only effective if discrimination is comprehensively
combated in all areas of life through, for example, community support, legislation and coordination tools such as strategies and frameworks at
both Member State and EU levels, including the possibility of introducing positive action measures.
Religion and belief: studies showed that the most discriminated religious groups in the area of employment include Jews, Sikhs and Muslims
(and especially women). Members recommended the adoption of European frameworks for national strategies to combat anti-Semitism and
Islamophobia.
Whilst acknowledging the role played by the European Court of Human Rights through its decisions in the interpretation of the Directive in its
entirety, Members expressed regret regarding the low number of cases referred to courts, which contrasts with the high number of

discrimination occurrences that emerge from victimisation surveys but are not pursued in law.
Given the increasingly xenophobic and Islamophobic context, Members considered that the consistent application of anti-discrimination
legislation should be viewed as an important element in radicalisation prevention strategies. Furthermore, they felt that further harmonisation is
needed when assessing the principle of the secularity of the state against the provisions of Article 4(2) of the Employment Equality Directive
regarding the ethos.
The report called upon Member States to recognise the fundamental right to freedom of conscience, and noted that restrictions imposed by
employers to the wearing of religious symbols are not always in line with international human rights standards.
Disability: noting that Directive 2000/78 in itself does not contain any definition of the concept of disability, Members encouraged Member
States to interpret EU law in such a way as to provide a basis for a concept of disability in line with the Convention on the Rights of Persons
with Disabilities (CRPD),
Deploring the fact that the employment rate among women with disabilities is less than 5%, the report stressed the importance of protecting
disabled workers, including those with a terminal illness, from any form of discrimination in the workplace, as well as the need to protect these
workers from unfair dismissal.
Members encouraged Member States to: (i) develop and implement an all-encompassing framework for measures enabling access to quality
employment for persons with disabilities, including the possibility of using, for example, fines imposed for failure to comply with
anti-discrimination legislation; (ii) provide ongoing support to employers that hire persons with disabilities; (iii) combat prejudice against
persons with disabilities, especially persons with psychosocial or intellectual disabilities.
Age: underlining the important contributions that older workers make to society and the competitiveness of companies, Members called on
Member States to promote access to employment and integration into the labour market of all workers regardless of their age, and to apply
measures in order to protect all workers in the workplace
The report stressed the need to study the increasing problem of unemployment among people over the age of 50 and to develop effective
tools, such as vocational training and incentives or subsidies for employers, in order to reintegrate older workers into the labour market and
protect them against unfair dismissal. It underlined the need to upscale digital skills among the working population to help older people and
workers with disabilities remain longer in the labour market.
Members welcomed the Commission's initiative on work-life balance. They recommended that the initiative fully include measures to support
informal carers and grandparents of working age, as well as young parents.
Sexual orientation: Members recalled that the scope of protection from discrimination available to trans people remains uncertain in many
Member States. They called for measures to implement effectively national legislation transposing the Gender Equality Directive (recast). Such
measures could improve legal definitions to ensure that protection includes all transgender people and not only trans people who are
undergoing or have undergone gender reassignment.
In general, the report recommended, inter alia:
developing harmonised and homogeneous statistics designed to fill in all gaps in the collection of gender equality data;
strengthening the role of the national equality bodies, ensuring their impartiality, developing their activities and enhancing their
capacities, including through the provision of adequate funding;
displaying greater commitment in implementing the principle of equality between women and men in employment policies;
enhancing the reconciliation of work and private life by concrete measures, such as urgently proposing new legislative proposals on
the Maternity Leave Directive so as to guarantee the right for women to return to work after pregnancy and maternity leave and
parental leave;
improving complaint mechanisms at national level by strengthening national equality bodies;
paying close attention to the rules applicable to sanctions and redress in the Member States;
ensuring adequate training is provided for employees of national, regional and local authorities, law enforcement bodies and labour
inspectorates;
involving social partners (trade unions and employers) and civil society, including equality bodies, in the effective application of
equality in employment and occupation.

2015/2116(INI) - 15/09/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 475 votes to 63 with 74 abstentions a resolution on the application of Council Directive 2000/78/EC of 27
November 2000 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation (Employment Equality Directive).
Prohibit discrimination: Parliament welcomed the fact that almost all Member States have included the general principle of equal treatment on
specific grounds of discrimination in their constitutions. However, it regretted that only a few Member States have systematically ensured that
all existing legal texts are in line with the principle of equal treatment.
regretting the increase in experiences of discrimination and harassment, Members called on the Commission to include a specific focus on all
types of discrimination when monitoring the implementation of Directive 2000/78/EC, and to speed up the adoption of the EU horizontal
anti-discrimination directive proposed by the Commission in 2008, which was voted for by Parliament.
Members noted that non-discrimination in the field of occupation and employment is only effective if discrimination is comprehensively
combated in all areas of life through, for example, community support, legislation and coordination tools such as strategies and frameworks at
both Member State and EU levels, including the possibility of introducing positive action measures.
Religion and belief: studies showed that the most discriminated religious groups in the area of employment include Jews, Sikhs and Muslims
(and especially women). Members recommended the adoption of European frameworks for national strategies to combat anti-Semitism and
Islamophobia.
Given the increasingly xenophobic and Islamophobic context, Members considered that the consistent application of anti-discrimination
legislation should be viewed as an important element in radicalisation prevention strategies. Whilst acknowledging the role played by the

European Court of Human Rights through its decisions in the interpretation of the Directive in its entirety, Members expressed regret regarding
the low number of cases referred to courts, which contrasts with the high number of discrimination occurrences that emerge from victimisation
surveys but are not pursued in justice. Parliament called upon Member States to recognise the fundamental right to freedom of conscience. It
insisted that religious freedom is an important principle that should be respected by employers, underlining, however, that the implementation
of this principle is a question of subsidiarity.
Disability: Members encouraged Member States to interpret EU law in such a way as to provide a basis for a concept of disability in line with
the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). They stressed the importance of:
protecting disabled workers, including those with a terminal illness, from any form of discrimination in the workplace
ensuring that socially responsible public procurement might be used as an instrument to integrate people with disabilities and other
vulnerable groups into the labour market;
using structural funds, in particular the European Social Fund, to adapt workplaces and to provide necessary assistance for persons
with disabilities at work;
implementing an all-encompassing framework for measures enabling access to quality employment for persons with disabilities.
Members encouraged Member States to: (i) develop and implement an all-encompassing framework for measures enabling access to quality
employment for persons with disabilities, including the possibility of using, for example, fines imposed for failure to comply with
anti-discrimination legislation; (ii) provide ongoing support to employers that hire persons with disabilities; (iii) combat prejudice against
persons with disabilities, especially persons with psychosocial or intellectual disabilities.
Age: underlining the important contributions that older workers make to society and the competitiveness of companies, Parliament stressed the
need to:

order to protect all workers in the workplace
study the increasing problem of unemployment among people over the age of 50 and to develop effective tools in order to reintegrate
older workers into the labour market and protect them against unfair dismissal;
upscale digital skills among the working population to help older people and workers with disabilities remain longer in the labour
market;
promote free high-quality public services that provide proper and necessary care and assistance for children, the sick and the elderly.
Members welcomed the Commission's initiative on work-life balance. They recommended that the initiative fully include measures to support
informal carers and grandparents of working age, as well as young parents.
Sexual orientation: Members recalled that the scope of protection from discrimination available to trans people remains uncertain in many
Member States. They called for measures to implement effectively national legislation transposing the Gender Equality Directive (recast). They
also regretted the general under-reporting of all forms of discrimination against LGBTI people and highlighted the role of national LGBTI
organisations as key partners in raising awareness.
In general terms, Parliament recommended, inter alia:
developing harmonised and homogeneous statistics designed to fill in all gaps in the collection of gender equality data;
strengthening the role of the national equality bodies, ensuring their impartiality, developing their activities and enhancing their
capacities, including through the provision of adequate funding;
displaying greater commitment in implementing the principle of equality between women and men in employment policies;
enhancing the reconciliation of work and private life by concrete measures, such as urgently proposing new legislative proposals on
the Maternity Leave Directive so as to guarantee the right for women to return to work after pregnancy and maternity leave and
