OJ L 136 25.05.2016, p. 0001 Summary

2015/0152(NLE) - 16/07/2015 Initial legislative proposal
PURPOSE: the conclusion of a protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Fisheries Partnership
Agreement between the European Community on the one hand, and the Government of Denmark and the Home Rule Government of

Greenland, on the other.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: on the basis of a mandate granted to it by the Council, the European Commission on behalf of the Union negotiated with the
Government of Denmark and Government of Greenland in view of renewing the Protocol to the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the
European Union and these two territorial entities.
Following these negotiations, a new Protocol was initialled on 20 March 2015.
The new Protocol is in line with the objectives of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement, strengthens the cooperation between the Union and
Greenland and promotes a partnership framework in which to develop a sustainable fisheries policy and responsible exploitation of fishery
resources in the Greenlandic fishing zone in the interest of both Parties.
CONTENT: with this proposal for a Decision, the Commission proposes the conclusion of a protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and
financial contribution provided for in the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community on the one hand, and the
Government of Denmark and the Home Rule Government of Greenland, on the other.
Period of application: the Fishing Protocol would cover a period of five years from the date of provisional application ? i.e. from the date of its
signature and from 1 January 2016 at the earliest.
Fishing opportunities: the Protocol grants fishing opportunities to Union vessels in the fishing zone of Greenland, in line with relevant
conservation and management measures and within the limits of the available surplus.
To this effect, the protocol sets an indicative annual level of fishing opportunities granted by Greenland (in tonnes) to Union vessels by
species:
cod;
pelagic redfish;
demersal redfish;
halibut;
northern prawn;
capelin;
grenadier;
by-catch (catches of all marine living organisms where these are not mentioned as target species on the fishing authorization of the
vessel or do not meet the minimum size requirements; these are limited to a rate of 5% in the Northern prawn fisheries and 10% in
other fisheries.
Following results to be assessed by the ICES Advisory Committee on the ongoing investigations and surveys at sea carried out on the
different components of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in Greenland waters and more particularly on spawners located West Greenland inshore,
West Greenland offshore and East Greenland offshore, the Joint Committee may revise or adjust the indicative fishing opportunities for cod.
Financial contribution: the Protocol provides for a total annual financial contribution of EUR 17.799.978 per year for its duration.
This amount corresponds to:
EUR 13.168.978 per year for the access to the Greenlandic fishing zone,
EUR 2.931.000 per year, corresponding to the additional envelope paid by the EU in support of Greenland's fisheries policy and
EUR 1.700.000 as an annual reserve for additional and new fishing opportunities that may be accepted by the EU subject to scientific
advice and surplus resources.
The two Parties have agreed to cooperate to implement Greenlandic sectorial fisheries policy and to that end shall continue the policy dialogue
on the relevant programming.
Specific provisions: provision is made for the setting of principles for responsible fisheries management. Provision is also made for an
experimental fisheries programme for species not included in the protocol, as well as scientific cooperation on sustainable fishery exploitation.

2015/0152(NLE) - 30/10/2015 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for by the Fisheries
Partnership Agreement between the European Community on the one hand, and the Government of Denmark and the Home Rule
Government of Greenland, on the other hand.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: on 28 June 2007, the Council adopted Regulation (EC) No 753/2007 concerning the conclusion of the Fisheries Partnership
Agreement between the European Community on the one hand, and the Government of Denmark and the Home Rule Government of
Greenland, on the other hand.
The current Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for by the Partnership Agreement expires on 31
December 2015.
The Union has negotiated with the Government of Denmark and the Government of Greenland a new protocol to the Partnership Agreement
setting out the fishing possibilities and financial contribution. The Protocol was signed in accordance with a Council Decision and has been
applied on provisional basis.

It is now necessary to approve the Protocol on behalf of the Union.
CONTENT, with this proposed Decision, the Council is called upon to conclude the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and the
financial contribution provided for by the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community on the one hand, Denmark and
Greenland, on the other hand, on behalf of the Union (for further details as regards the fishing opportunities provided for in this Fisheries
Partnership Agreement, please refer to the summary of the initial legislative proposal dated 16.7.2015 ).
Simplified procedure to define the EUs position within the EU-Greenland Joint Committee: the Agreement sets up a Joint Committee to
monitor the application of the Partnership Agreement and ensure its implementation. Furthermore, in accordance with the Protocol, the Joint
Committee may approve certain modifications to the Protocol. In order to facilitate the approval of such modifications, it is appropriate to
empower the Commission, subject to specific conditions, to approve them under a simplified procedure.
Annex: the draft Decision lays down the powers conferred on the Commission as well as the procedure for the establishment of the EUs
position within the Joint Committee. The Commission shall be authorised to negotiate with Greenland and, modifications to the Protocol in
respect of the following issues:
fixing of fishing opportunities of the Protocol, including fixing the reference price and the authorisation fees;
decision on the modalities of the sectoral support;
adoption of measures to ensure sustainable exploitation of the fishery resources in accordance with the Protocol.
In the Joint Committee, the Union shall act in accordance with the objectives pursued by the Union within the framework of the Common
Fisheries Policy. It shall also promote positions that are consistent with the relevant rules adopted by Regional Fisheries Management
Organisations and in the context of joint management by coastal States.
When a decision on modifications to the Protocol is foreseen to be adopted during a Joint Committee Meeting, the necessary steps shall be
taken so as to ensure that the position to be expressed on behalf of the Union takes account of the latest statistical, biological and other
relevant information transmitted to the Commission.
Technical provisions are foreseen in order to set the framework and the practical conditions as regards the approval of the amendments to the
Protocol.
To this effect, and based on that information, a document setting out the particulars of the proposed Union position shall be transmitted by the
Commission services, in sufficient time before the relevant Joint Committee Meeting, to the Council or to its preparatory bodies for
consideration and approval.

2015/0152(NLE) - 23/03/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Fisheries adopted the report by Marco AFFRONTE (EFDD, IT) on the draft Council decision on the conclusion, on behalf of
the European Union, of the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for by the Fisheries Partnership
Agreement between the European Community on the one hand, and the Government of Denmark and the Home Rule Government of
Greenland, on the other hand.
The committee recommended the European Parliament to give its consent to the conclusion of the Agreement.
Members approved the new Protocol as it strengthens the cooperation between the Union and Greenland. However, they drew attention to
some aspects that need to be improved such as establishing the sustainable exploitation of fish stocks; following scientific advice and the EU
interests in fisheries arrangements with Northern partners as well as more control and adjustment to the EU's financial compensation,
according to the ex-post assessment of the protocol.
Members also stressed the importance of respecting the principles and objectives covering the Common Fisheries Policies and the Fisheries
Partnership Agreements as regards fish stocks.
Lastly, Members regretted that the European Parliament has a limited role in the adoption of the Fisheries Partnership agreements through
only a consent procedure. They believe that the European Parliament should have a more active role and should be immediately and fully
informed at all stages of the procedures concerning the FPAs or its renewals in order to increase transparency and democratic accountability
of the protocols.

2015/0152(NLE) - 12/04/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 666 votes to 32, with 4 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the draft Council decision on the
conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for by
the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community on the one hand, and the Government of Denmark and the Home
Rule Government of Greenland, on the other hand.
In line with the recommendation made by the Committee on Fisheries, Parliament gave its consent to the conclusion of the Protocol.
To recall, on 16 July 2015, the European Commission adopted the proposals for renewing the Protocol to the Fisheries Partnership Agreement
between the European Union on the one hand and the Government of Denmark and the Home Rule Government of Greenland, on the other
hand.
The New Protocol provides for an EU financial contribution of EUR 17.8 million per year, comprising:
·

an annual amount for the access to the Greenlandic EEZ of EUR 13.17 million (calculated based on reference prices for each
species) including a financial reserve of EUR 1.7 million for additional quantities of species made available by Greenland;

·

a specific amount of EUR 2.931 million provided to support Greenlandic sectoral fisheries policy. The sectoral policy support is
broken down into three main areas: administration (e.g. capacity development); control and enforcement; and scientific research and

advice.
