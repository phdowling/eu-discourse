2015/2162(DEC) - 23/07/2015 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: presentation by the Commission of the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2014, as part of
the 2014 discharge procedure.
Analysis of the accounts of the EU Institutions: European Data Protection Supervisor.
Legal reminder: the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the year 2014 have been prepared on the basis of the
information presented by the institutions and bodies under Article 148(2) of the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the
European Union.
(1) Purpose: the document helps to bring insight into the EU budget mechanism and the way in which the budget has been managed and
spent in 2014, including the different expenses of the European institutions. It should be recalled that only the Commission budget contains
administrative appropriations and operating appropriations. The other Institutions have only administrative appropriations.
The document also presents the different financial actors involved in the budget process (accounting officers, internal officers and authorising
officers) and recalls their respective roles in the context of the tasks of sound financial management.
Amongst the other legal elements relating to the implementation of the EU budget presented in this document, the paper focuses on the
following issues:
accounting principles applicable to the management of EU spending (business continuity, consistency of accounting methods,
comparability of information ...);
consolidation methods of figures for all major controlled entities (the consolidated financial statements of the EU comprise all
significant controlled entities institutions, organisations and agencies);
the recognition of financial assets in the EU (tangible and intangible assets, financial assets and other miscellaneous investments);
the way in which EU public expenditure is committed and spent, including pre-financing (cash advances intended for the benefit of an

EU organ);
the means of recovery following irregularities detected;
the performance indicators in the framework of the financial implementation;
the modus operandi of the accounting system;
the audit process followed by the European Parliament's granting of the discharge.
Discharge procedure: the final control is the discharge of the budget for a given financial year. The discharge represents the political aspect of
the external control of budget implementation and is the decision by which the European Parliament, acting on a Council recommendation,
"releases" the Commission from its responsibility for management of a given budget by marking the end of that budget's existence. When
granting discharge, Parliament may make observations which it considers important and often recommends the Commission and the other
institutions to take actions concerning these matters.
The document also details specific expenditure of the institutions, in particular: (i) pensions of former Members and officials of institutions; (ii)
joint sickness insurance scheme and (iii) buildings.
The document also presents a series of tables and detailed technical indicators on (i) the balance sheet; (ii) the economic outturn account; (iii)
cashflow tables; (iv) technical annexes concerning the financial statements.
(2) Implementation of the EDPSs appropriations for the financial year 2014: the document comprises a series of detailed annexes, the most
important concerning the implementation of the budget. As regards the EDPSs expenditure, the information is drawn from the Budgetary and
Financial Management Report 2014. The appropriations available for 2014 amounted to 9 million with 82.2% of these committed.
The implementation of the EDPSs budget in 2014 was marked by the following:
Supervision: the EDPS monitors the processing of personal data in the EU administration and ensures compliance with the data
protection rules. The supervisory tasks range from prior checking processing operations likely to present specific risks, to handling
complaints and conducting enquiries.
Consultation: the EDPS advises the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council on proposals for new legislation
and a wide range of other issues having an impact on data protection.
Cooperation: the EDPS cooperates with other data protection authorities in order to promote consistent data protection throughout
Europe.
The EDPS regularly expresses its positions in different types of publications such as policy and strategy documents, particularly as regards its
advisory role, the relationship between access to documents and data protection and the role of data protection officers (DPOs).
In its annual reports, the EDPS presents the main results and developments which marked the previous year. The reports cover the three main
areas of activity of the Supervisor (supervision, consultation and cooperation) and developments in the areas of communication,
administrative, budgetary and human resources.
The EDPS and the Assistant EDSP also participate in conferences and meetings. Information brochures were handed out to inform the public
on the role of the EDPS and the rights of individuals, as well as fact sheets.
The 2014 Annual Report reviews the activities of the European Data Protection Supervisor and our focus on increasing the capacity of EU
bodies for accountable data processing and for more proactive integration of data protection rules and principles in policy making.

2015/2162(DEC) - 02/02/2016 Supplementary non-legislative basic document
On the basis of the observations made by the Court of Auditors, the Council recommended the European Parliament to give a discharge to all
the Union institutions in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Union for the financial year 2014 .
The Council welcomed that the administrative and related expenditure of the institutions and bodies of the EU remained free from material
error and that the estimated level of error reported by the Court for this policy area decreased to 0.5 %. It noted with satisfaction that the Court
did not detect any significant weaknesses in the examined systems.
However, the Council took note of the issues identified by the Court in some of the institutions and bodies audited. It invited the institutions and
bodies concerned to further pursue the measures already taken and encouraged them to address the remaining weaknesses pointed out by
the Court without delay.
In addition, the Council highlighted the need to remedy the weaknesses detected by the Court in the calculation of staff costs and the
management of family allowances in several institutions, in close collaboration with the Office for the Administration and Payment of Individual
Entitlements.

2015/2162(DEC) - 08/04/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Monica MACOVEI (ECR, RO) calling on the European Parliament to give
discharge to the European Data Protection Supervisor in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Union for the
financial year 2014.
It welcomed the fact that the Court of Auditors observed that no significant weaknesses had been identified in respect of the audited topics
relating to human resources and procurement for the Supervisor. The Court concluded that the payments as a whole for the year ended on 31
December 2014 for administrative and other expenditure of the institutions and bodies were free from material error.
Budget and financial management: Members note that in 2014 the Supervisor had a total allocated budget of EUR 8 012 953 (EUR 7 661 409
in 2013) and that the implementation rate was 92 % (84.7 % in 2013). They welcome the improved result.
Members note that all open recommendations made by the Internal Audit Service were closed in 2014, including that on securing the

data contained in complaints.
Further to the recommendations, a Procurement Plan was adopted for the first time for the year 2014. Members encourage the
Supervisor to improve its financial autonomy.
Members regret that the Supervisor did not make available full information about its policy on conflicts of interest. They urge the
Supervisor to adhere to the rules covered by the Staff Regulations and to lay down clear, binding rules regarding "revolving doors".
They note the cut to the budget lines for translation, publications and activities of the Supervisor.
They call on the Supervisor to reduce appropriations allocated to missions, travel and other ancillary expenditure.
They ask the Supervisor to include in its Annual Activity Report (AAR) for 2015 information on
-

internal rules concerning whistleblowing,
a list of all contracts awarded in which it has participated, even if launched by other institutions, and their procedures and
selection criteria

-

a scoreboard on the results of its use of key performance indicators to assess the efficient use of resources

-

its building policy, since it is important that the costs of such a policy be properly rationalised and not excessive

-

an exhaustive table of all human resources.
