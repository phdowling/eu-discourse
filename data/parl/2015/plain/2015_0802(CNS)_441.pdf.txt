2015/0802(CNS) - 12/01/2015 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to establish a social protection committee.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to
follow its opinion.
BACKGROUND: in its Resolution of 16 February 2000, the European Parliament welcomed the Commission's communication and the creation
of such a group in order to enhance cooperation in the field of social protection by, among other things, setting up a group of high-level
officials.
In its Conclusions of 17 December 1999 on the strengthening of cooperation for modernising and improving social protection, the Council
supported the Commission's proposal to establish a mechanism for enhanced cooperation, brought about by the work of the group of
high-level officials, for the implementation of this action.
The Social Protection Committee set up by Council Decision 2000/436/EC repealed and replaced by Decision 2004/689/EC clearly
demonstrated its utility as an advisory body for both the Council and the Commission and has contributed actively to the development of the
Open Method of Coordination (OMC), as established by the Lisbon European Council on 23 and 24 March 2000.

In its Conclusions of June 2013, the European Council stated that the social dimension of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) should be
strengthened. It is also important to ensure better coordination of employment and social policies, while fully respecting national competences.
In October 2013, it held that the coordination of economic, employment and social policies will be further enhanced in line with existing
procedures while fully respecting national competences.
CONTENT: the proposed Council Decision aims to establish a Social Protection Committee, with advisory status, to promote cooperation on
social protection policies between Member States and with the Commission.
Functions and tasks: the tasks of the Committee shall be:
to monitor the social situation and the development of social protection policies in the Member States and the Union;
to promote exchanges of information, experience and good practice between Member States and with the Commission;
to prepare reports, formulate opinions or undertake other work within its fields of competence, at the request of either the Council or
the Commission or on its own initiative.
To fulfil its tasks the Committee may, inter alia:
make use of the open method of coordination, including by applying jointly agreed monitoring instruments and implementing mutually
agreed evaluation arrangements in the implementation of common objectives agreed by the Council;
contribute to all aspects of the European Semester within its field of competence and report on them to the Council;
work, as appropriate, in cooperation with other relevant bodies and committees dealing with social and economic policy matters, such
as the Employment Committee, the Economic and Financial Committee, the Economic Policy Committee and the Working Party on
Public Health at Senior Level.
In fulfilling its mandate, the Committee shall cooperate with the social partners. The European Parliament shall be informed regarding the
activities of the Committee.
Membership and operation: the Committee's membership shall consist of two representatives appointed by each Member State and two
representatives of the Commission. The Committee shall elect its Chairperson from among the members appointed by the Member States for
a term of two years, which shall be renewable once.
Decision 2004/689/EC shall be repealed as from the date of the first meeting of the Committee following the entry into force of this decision.

2015/0802(CNS) - 26/03/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, within the framework of a special legislative framework, (consultation of Parliament),
adopted the report by Marita ULVSKOG (ADLE, SE) on the draft Council decision establishing the Social Protection Committee and repealing
Decision 2004/689/EC.
The parliamentary committee recommended that the European Parliament approve, as amended, the proposed Council Decision to establish
a Social Protection Committee, with advisory status, to promote cooperation on social protection policies between Member States and with the
Commission.
The parliamentary committee said that the guarantee of high quality and sustainable health care for all should figure among the four broad
objectives identified by the Commission within the overall challenge of modernising social protection systems.
With regard to strengthening the social dimension of the economic and monetary union (EMU), the Members stressed the importance of
ensuring better coordination of employment, social and socio-economic policies, while fully respecting national competences.

2015/0802(CNS) - 15/04/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 542 votes to 80, with 15 abstentions, within the framework of a special procedure (consultation of
Parliament), a legislative resolution on the draft Council decision establishing the Social Protection Committee and repealing Decision
2004/689/EC.
The European Parliament approved, as amended, the proposed Council Decision to establish a Social Protection Committee, with advisory
status, to promote cooperation on social protection policies between Member States and with the Commission.
Parliament stated, in a recital, that the Council had approved the four broad objectives identified by the Commission within the overall
challenge of modernising social protection systems, namely:
路

to make work pay and provide secure income,

路

to make pensions safe and pension systems sustainable,

路

to promote social inclusion, and

路

to ensure high quality and sustainable health care for all.

With regard to strengthening the social dimension of the economic and monetary union (EMU), the Parliament stressed the importance of
ensuring better coordination of employment, social and socio-economic policies, while fully respecting national competences.
