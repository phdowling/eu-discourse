OJ L 284 30.10.2015, p. 0001 Summary

2015/0029(NLE) - 06/02/2015 Initial legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude, on behalf of the European Union, of the protocol amending the Marrakesh agreement establishing the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: the World Trade Organization (WTO) launched the Doha Round of trade negotiations, known as the Doha Development
Agenda in November 2001.
The negotiations on trade facilitation were launched in July 2004, based on a commitment to clarify and improve several articles of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (GATT 1994): such as those concerning: (i) freedom of transit); (ii) fees and formalities connected with

importation and exportation); (iii) publication and administration of trade regulations.
Moreover, the mandate referred to provisions for effective cooperation between customs or any other appropriate authorities on trade
facilitation and customs compliance issues.
The 9th WTO Ministerial Conference held in Bali on 3-6 December 2013 adopted the Ministerial Decision on Trade Facilitation, which
concluded negotiations on the Agreement on Trade Facilitation subject to the legal review of the text.
At its meeting on 26 November 2014, the WTO's General Council adopted the Protocol amending the Marrakesh Agreement establishing the
World Trade Organisation and opened it for acceptance by the WTO Members. The Protocol should now be concluded on behalf of the Union.
CONTENT: under this proposal, the Council is invited to conclude the protocol amending the Marrakesh agreement establishing the World
Trade Organization.
The protocol includes the Agreement on Trade facilitation and the commitments will become an integral part of the Agreement.
The Agreement contains a set of measures designed to improve the cross-border movement of goods by improving transparency, streamlining
customs procedures and eliminating red tape. For developing countries, it also contains innovative flexibilities which may become standard in
future rules type agreements.
The Agreement is divided into two sections:
the first contains provisions for expediting the movement, release and clearance of goods;
the second contains special and differential treatment provisions for developing and least-developed countries aimed at helping them
implement the provisions of the Agreement.
The OECD Trade Facilitation Indicators estimate that comprehensive implementation of all measures of the Agreement on Trade Facilitation
would reduce total trade costs by 10% in developed countries and by 13-15.5% in developing countries.

2015/0029(NLE) - 06/03/2015 Legislative proposal

Organization (WTO).
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
CONTENT: it is proposed that the protocol amending the Marrakesh agreement establishing the World Trade Organization be approved on
behalf of the European Union. This protocol was adopted by the WTOs General Council at its meeting on 27 November 2014.
The 9th WTO Ministerial Conference held in Bali on 3-6 December 2013 adopted the Ministerial Decision on Trade Facilitation, which
concluded negotiations on the Agreement on Trade Facilitation subject to the legal review of the text.
The protocol includes the Agreement on Trade facilitation and the commitments of developing countries will become an integral part of the
Agreement.
For details of the main provisions of this Agreement, please refer to the summary of the Commissions initial legislative proposal dated
6.2.2015.

2015/0029(NLE) - 22/07/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on International Trade adopted the report by Pablo ZALBA BIDEGAIN (EPP, ES) on the draft Council decision on the
conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Protocol Amending the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization.
The committee recommended that the European Parliament give its consent to the conclusion of the Agreement.
The trade facilitation agreement (TFA) which was concluded at the 9th WTO Ministerial Conference in December 2013 is the first multilateral
agreement since the WTO was established in 1995. The issue first appeared on the WTO agenda during the Ministerial in Singapore in 1996
and subsequently found its way into the Doha Declaration where WTO members committed to concluding a deal on this issue.
The Agreement demonstrates the ability to be innovative in recognising differences in implementation capacity across nations. In particular, by:
allowing developing and least developed countries to categorise commitments and determine the timing of their implementation;
linking implementation of some disciplines to the provision of technical assistance;
calling for joint action by donor countries, development assistance providers and developing and least developed country WTO
members to assist the latter in implementing some provisions of the agreement;
incorporating an Expert Group to assess the situation in a Member once notified implementation periods have expired, and the use of
the TFA Committee as a forum for the exchange of experiences and deliberation.
The TFA will require increased transparency and greater cooperation between customs authorities. It focuses on cooperation aimed at
achieving a set of good practices that governments can support and comply with.
In order for the TFA to enter into force, it needs to be ratified by two thirds of the 160 WTO members who agreed it at the 9th Ministerial
Conference.

2015/0029(NLE) - 09/09/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading

The European Parliament adopted by 569 votes to 99, with 27 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the draft Council decision on the
conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Protocol Amending the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization.
In line with the Committee on International Trade, Parliament gave its consent to the conclusion of the Agreement.
The trade facilitation agreement (TFA) which was concluded at the 9th WTO Ministerial Conference in December 2013 is the first multilateral
agreement since the WTO was established in 1995. The issue first appeared on the WTO agenda during the Ministerial in Singapore in 1996
and subsequently found its way into the Doha Declaration where WTO members committed to concluding a deal on this issue.
The agreement demonstrates the ability to be innovative in recognising differences in implementation capacity across nations by calling on
developing and least developed countries to determine when they will apply specific provisions of the agreement and by linking
implementation of some disciplines to the delivery of assistance from developed nations.
The TFA will require increased transparency and greater cooperation between customs authorities. It focuses on cooperation aimed at
achieving a set of good practices that governments can support and comply with.
In order for the TFA to enter into force, it needs to be ratified by two thirds of the 160 WTO members who agreed it at the 9th Ministerial
Conference.
