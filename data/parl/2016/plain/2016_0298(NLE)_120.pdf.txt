Summary

2016/0298(NLE) - 21/09/2016 Initial legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude, on behalf of the European Union, the Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union
and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Cuba, of the other.

BACKGROUND: relations between the European Union and Cuba are currently governed by the EU's Common Position 96/697/CFSP of 2
December 1996.
On 10 February 2014, the Council adopted a Decision authorising the Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign
Affairs and Security Policy to open negotiations for a Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement (PDCA) between the European Union and
its Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Cuba, of the other part.
The negotiations began on 29 April 2014 and were concluded after seven rounds in March 2016. The Agreement was initialled on 11 March
2016 in Havana, in the presence of the High Representative and the Commissioner for International Development and Cooperation.
The European Parliament was also kept informed throughout the negotiations.
It is now necessary to approve the Agreement.
CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve, on behalf of the Union, the Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement
between the European Union and it Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Cuba, of the other part is hereby approved on behalf
of the Union. The Agreement should supersede Common Position 96/697/CFSP.
The PDCA is the first bilateral agreement between the EU and Cuba. It aims to consolidate and strengthen links between the parties in the
areas of political dialogue, cooperation and trade, on the basis of mutual respect, reciprocity, common interest and respect for their
sovereignty.
The relationship will be geared to supporting the modernisation of the Cuban economy and society, cooperating bilaterally and in international
fora with a view to strengthening human rights and democracy, countering discrimination and achieving the sustainable development goals.
The Agreement builds essentially on a three-pillar structure:
political dialogue: the relevant provisions cover a range of policy areas, including human rights, small arms and light weapons,
disarmament and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, serious crimes of international concern (including the
International Criminal Court), unilateral coercive measures (i.e. US embargo), combating the production, trafficking and consumption
of illicit drugs, combating racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and sustainable development;
cooperation and sector policy dialogue: these provisions cover a very wide range of areas for future cooperation, including political
and legal (governance and human rights, justice, citizen security and migration), social, environmental, economic and developmental
issues. Particular attention is also given to regional (Caribbean and Latin American) integration and cooperation;
trade and trade cooperation: this part codifies the conventional (WTO-related) basis for EU-Cuba trade. In addition, it includes
provisions on trade facilitation and cooperation in areas such as technical barriers to trade and standards, with a view to improving the
prospects for deeper economic relations. It also includes a clause envisaging the future development of a stronger framework for
investments.
The Agreement also establishes an institutional framework composed of a Joint Council and a Joint Committee and includes a provision on the
fulfilment of obligations. The Agreement is concluded for an unlimited period and can be terminated at six months? notice.

2016/0298(NLE) - 22/06/2017 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Foreign Affairs adopted the report by Elena VALENCIANO (S&D, ES) on the draft Council decision on the conclusion, on
behalf of the Union, of the Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part,
and the Republic of Cuba, of the other part.
The committee recommended the European Parliament to give its consent to the conclusion of Agreement.
As a reminder, the Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement, which the EU signed with Cuba in December 2016, defines general
principles and objectives for the relationship between the EU and Cuba. It builds essentially on three main chapters:
political dialogue on issues such as human rights, small arms and disarmament, migration, drugs, fight against terrorism, and
sustainable development;

cooperation and sector policy dialogue: human rights, governance, justice, civil society, social and economic development,
environment as well as regional cooperation;
trade and trade cooperation: cooperation on customs, trade facilitation, technical norms and standards, sustainable trade and
investment.
In the explanatory statement accompanying the report, it is stressed that this Agreement is a necessary and appropriate instrument which will
provide a framework for the relations that the EU and Cuba.
As an international legal instrument, it offers a model for a new-generation agreement which sets out very clear political dialogue and human
rights commitments.
Through this Agreement, the EU is pledging to accompany Cuba in its evolution while fully respecting its autonomy, sovereignty and
independence.
As regards trade and economic relations in general, the Agreement will provide a stronger framework to match the scale that these relations
have already reached.
This is the first bilateral political agreement that the EU and Cuba have signed. Parliaments support should be critical and vigilant, applying the
same demands and the same level of respect that is applied to other partners who have pledged to share the EUs values and aspirations.

political dialogue covering issues such as human rights;
cooperation and sector policy dialogue;
trade and trade cooperation.
