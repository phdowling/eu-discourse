Summary

The European Parliament adopted a resolution on the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
The text adopted in plenary was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ECR, ALDE, Greens/EFA and EFDD groups.
Parliament is deeply concerned about the deteriorating security and human rights situation in the DRC. Since January 2015, Congolese
security and intelligence officials have clamped down on peaceful activists, political leaders and others who oppose attempts to allow
President Kabila to modify the constitution in order to stay in power past his constitutionally mandated two-term limit.
Members insisted on the fact that it is the governments responsibility to prevent any deepening of the current political crisis or escalation of
violence and to respect, protect and promote the civil and political rights of its citizens. They considered the fight against impunity to be a
prerequisite for re-establishing peace in the DRC. It urged that measures be taken to ensure that perpetrators of human rights violations, war
crimes, crimes against humanity and sexual violence against women, together with those responsible for recruiting child soldiers, are reported,
identified, prosecuted and punished in accordance with national and international criminal law.
The DRC is asked to comply with the constitution and to ensure the timely holding of presidential and legislative elections by the end of 2016 ,
and to guarantee an environment conducive to transparent, credible and inclusive elections.
Members insisted that the nature and amount of EU support to the electoral process in the DRC must depend on the progress made in
implementing the recommendations of the Electoral Observation Missions of 2011 and 2014, in particular as regards guarantees of the
Independent National Electoral Commissions independence, the revision of the electoral roll, budgetary requirements and compliance with the
constitutional timeframe.
The European Union and the VP/HR are called upon to:
intensify the dialogue with the DCR authorities under the Cotonou Agreement, with the objective of obtaining definitive clarification
concerning the electoral process;
consider imposing targeted sanctions on those responsible for the violent crackdown in the DRC, including travel bans and asset
freezes;
monitor developments and to use all appropriate tools and instruments, including the European Instrument for Democracy and Human
Rights, to support human rights defenders and pro-democracy movements;
continue their assistance to the people of the DRC with a view to improving the living conditions of the most vulnerable populations
and tackling the consequences of displacement, food insecurity, epidemics and natural disasters;
ensure a permanent political dialogue among the countries of the Great Lakes region in order to prevent any further destabilisation.
Lastly, Parliament called for the reinstatement of a UN rapporteur on human rights in the DRC.
