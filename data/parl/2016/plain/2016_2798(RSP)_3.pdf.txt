Summary

2016/2798(RSP) - 17/05/2017 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a resolution prepared by its Committee on Employment and Social Affairs (EMPL) on the European
Qualifications Framework for Lifelong Learning.
The resolution follows a parliamentary question to the European Commission tabled by the EMPL Committee on the operation and revision of
the current European Qualifications Framework for Lifelong Learning (EQF).
Overall, Members considered that the further development of the EQF could encourage lifelong learning and help citizens by strengthening
their skills and competences.
Taking note of the Commission's initiative on the revision of the EQF and the modernisation of European education and training systems,
Members recommended safeguarding the very rich set of not only technical but also manual skills that has been handed down and have
enabled the development and growth of artisanal production sectors in each Member State.
They stressed that the Union should enable people, irrespective of their age or status, to have their skills and competences fully recognised,
including those gained through volunteering activities.
Members recommended the following:
more flexibility in updating the referencing of the national framework to the EQF;
an appropriate alignment between the EQF and the needs of society, including the labour market;
better use of the possibilities offered by the EQF in order to stimulate and facilitate the student and worker mobility in the Union.
Clarification of some aspects of the current EQF: Members called on the Commission to assess whether the 3 horizontal fields (knowledge,
skills and competences) should be revised so that they become more comprehensible and clear. They called for the 2006 European
Framework for the Development of Key Skills to be used as the main reference resource in order to achieve better terminological consistency
between the various Union frameworks and ultimately bring about a genuine learning outcome approach.
Promoting training to improve skills: Members stressed the need to promote training schemes combining apprenticeship training with
vocational training in vocational schools in the Member States. They also stressed the need to promote lifelong learning and to encourage the
development of a mobile and flexible workforce across Europe.
Mechanism for the validation of acquired skills: Members called for the promotion of common European principles on the availability and rapid
validation and recognition of non-formal and informal learning processes, including all training acquired in businesses.
Members also recommended that the Commission develop a self-assessment tool for employers to ensure the more efficient use of the EQF.
Members also call on the Commission to:
review its policy of promoting results-based funding in vocational education and training and higher education so as to ensure the
social role of education and training systems;
clarify the expected role for ECVET points and ECTS credits in order to ensure better transparency of the revision vis-à-vis the
stakeholders;
take into account in its current review skills acquired in third countries.
Lastly, Members stressed the need for more involvement of stakeholders, such as public employment services, social partners, education
actors and civil society.
