Summary

2016/2933(RSP) - 24/11/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 506 votes to 77, with 42 abstentions, a resolution on the situation in Syria.
The text adopted in plenary was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ECR, ALDE and Greens/EFA groups.
Members demanded an immediate end to bombing and indiscriminate attacks on civilians and expressed their gravest concern over the
continuing fighting, bombardment and worsened humanitarian situation in Syria.
Stressing that the deliberate starvation of populations is prohibited by international humanitarian law, Parliament urged all parties to allow
medical evacuations immediately from east Aleppo and all other besieged areas. It is stated that the Syrian regime has the primary
responsibility for the protection of the Syrian population.
Parliament condemned in the strongest terms the atrocities and widespread violations of human rights and international humanitarian law
committed by the Assad forces with the support of Russia and Iran, as well as the human rights abuses and violations of international
humanitarian law by non-state, armed terrorist groups, in particular Daesh, Jabhat Fateh al-Sham/the Al-Nusra Front and other jihadist groups.
These atrocities may be considered as serious war crimes and crimes against humanity and should not go unpunished.
Parliament called on the Union to ensure that all those responsible for violations of international human rights and humanitarian law face
justice through appropriate, impartial international criminal justice mechanisms or national courts and through the application of the principle of
universal jurisdiction. It reiterated its support for the creation of a Syrian war crimes tribunal pending a referral to the ICC.
The EU should consider all available options, including a no-fly zone over Aleppo city, to set out consequences for the most heinous human
rights violations and abuses by all perpetrators if the atrocities and blunt disrespect of humanitarian law continues.
Members urged all participants in the International Syria Support Group (ISSG) to resume negotiations in order to facilitate the establishment
of a stable truce and to intensify work on a lasting political settlement in Syria. The regional actors, in particular neighbouring countries, bear
special responsibility.
The resolution demanded respect by all for the right of ethnic and religious minorities in Syria, including Christians, to continue to live in their
historical and traditional homelands in dignity, equality and safety, and to fully practise their religion and beliefs freely without being subject to
any kind of coercion, violence or discrimination.
Lastly, Parliament called on the EU institutions and the Member States to provide full support to the UN and the Organisation for the
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in order to continue investigating the use and the destruction of chemical weapons by all sides in
Syria.
