Summary

2016/0810(CNS) - 04/07/2016 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to approve the conclusion by the European Police Office (Europol) of the Agreement on Operational and Strategic Cooperation
between Georgia and Europol.
PROPOSED ACT: Council implementing decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to
follow its opinion.
BACKGROUND: pursuant to Decision 2009/371/JHA and Decision 2009/934/JHA, Europol is to conclude agreements with the third States
which have been put on the list determined by Decision 2009/935/JHA.
Such agreements have the objective of supporting and strengthening action by the competent authorities of the Member States and their
mutual cooperation in preventing and combating organised crime, terrorism and other forms of serious crime affecting two or more Member
States, and may concern the exchange of operational, strategic or technical information, including personal data and classified information.
Georgia is included in the list determined by Decision 2009/935/JHA.
In order to increase effectiveness in preventing and combating serious forms of crime and, in particular, given that Georgia is a potential
candidate State and a close neighbour of the Union, Europol has initiated the procedure for the conclusion of an Agreement on Operational
and Strategic Cooperation between Georgia and Europol.
Strategic agreements involve the exchange of information excluding personal data. They may be concluded by Europol only after approval by
the Council, the latter having previously consulted the Management Board of Europol.
Operational agreements require, in addition, that the Council obtain, via the Management Board, the opinion of the Joint Supervisory Body of
Europol, in so far as the agreement concerns the exchange of personal data.
The Management Board approved the Operational and Strategic Agreement on 11-12 May 2016.
The conditions for triggering the exercise of the implementing powers by the Council pursuant to Decisions 2009/371/JHA, 2009/934/JHA and
2009/935/JHA have been met to approve the conclusion of the Operational and Strategic Agreement.
CONTENT: pursuant to the draft implementing decision, Europol is authorised to conclude the Agreement on Operational and Strategic
Cooperation between Georgia and Europol in preventing and combating organised crime and terrorism between these countries.
The terms of the cooperation governed by the Operational and Strategic Agreement provide for: the exchange of information, which may,
include specialist knowledge, general situation reports, results of strategic analysis, information on criminal investigation procedures and
information on crime-prevention methods; participation in training activities; and the provision of advice and support in individual criminal
investigations.
Moreover, the Operational and Strategic Agreement contains provisions relating to the exchange of personal data.
Denmark, the United Kingdom and Ireland are taking part in the adoption and application of this implementing Decision.

2016/0810(CNS) - 21/11/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs adopted, in the framework of a special legislative procedure (Parliaments
consultation), the report by Claude MORAES (S&D, UK) on the draft Council implementing decision approving the conclusion by the European
Police Office (Europol) of the Agreement on Operational and Strategic Cooperation between Georgia and Europol.
The committee called on the European Parliament to approve the Council draft.

The explanatory memorandum accompanying the report recalled that this proposal concerns the proposed approval of an operational and
strategic agreement between Europol and Georgia, providing for the exchange of information, including personal data. Such information could
be in the field of specialist knowledge, general situation reports, results of strategic analysis, information on criminal investigation procedures,
information on crime-prevention methods, and support in individual criminal investigations.
From that perspective, the committee supported the conclusion of this strategic and operational cooperation agreement with Georgia would
thus aid and reinforce the fight against terrorism and organized crime, which is international by definition.

2016/0810(CNS) - 14/12/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 544 votes to 99, with 66 abstentions (following the Parliaments consultation procedure), a legislative
resolution on the draft Council implementing decision approving the conclusion by the European Police Office (Europol) of the Agreement on
Operational and Strategic Cooperation between Georgia and Europol.
In line with its Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, Parliament approved the Council draft without amendment.
This Agreement shall contribute to enhancing cooperation with Georgia which is increasingly relevant in the fight against terrorism and
organised crime, more specifically since it is a transit country of so-called foreign fighters.
