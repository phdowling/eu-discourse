2016/2196(DEC) - 11/07/2016 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: presentation by the Commission of the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2015, as part of
the 2015 discharge procedure.
Analysis of the accounts of the Clean Sky 2 Joint Undertaking.
CONTENT: the organisational governance of the EU consists of institutions, agencies and other EU bodies whose expenditure is included in
the general budget of the Union.
The EU's operational expenditure of these institutions takes different forms, depending on how the money is paid out and managed.
From 2014 onwards, the Commission classifies its expenditure as follows:
Direct management: the budget is implemented directly by the Commission services.
Indirect management: the Commission confers tasks of implementation of the budget to bodies of EU law or national law, such as the
EU agencies.
Shared management: under this method of budget implementation tasks are delegated to Member States. About 80 % of the
expenditure falls under this management mode covering such areas as agricultural spending and structural actions.
This Commission document concerns the EU's consolidated accounts for the year 2015 and details how spending by the EU institutions and
bodies was carried out. The consolidated annual accounts of the EU provide financial information on the activities of the institutions, agencies
and other bodies of the EU from an accrual accounting and budgetary perspective.

It is the responsibility of the Commission's Accounting Officer to prepare the EU's consolidated annual accounts and ensure that they present
fairly, in all material aspects, the financial position, the result of the operations and the cash flows of the EU institutions and bodies, including
the Clean Sky 2 JU, with a view to granting discharge.
Discharge procedure: the final step of a budget lifecycle is the discharge of the budget for a given financial year. It represents the political
aspect of the external control of budget implementation and is the decision by which the European Parliament, acting on a Council
recommendation, "releases" the Commission (and other EU bodies) from its responsibility for management of a given budget by marking the
end of that budget's existence. The European Parliament is the discharge authority within the EU.
The discharge procedure may produce three outcomes: (i) the granting; (ii) postponement or; (iii) the refusal of the discharge.
The final discharge report including specific recommendations to the Commission for action is adopted in plenary by the European Parliament
and are subject to an annual follow up report in which the Commission outlines the concrete actions it has taken to implement the
recommendations made.
Each agency is subject to its own discharge procedure, including the Clean Sky 2 JU.
Clean Sky 2 JU: the Clean Sky 2 Joint Undertaking, which is located in Brussels (BE), was set up Council Regulation (EU) No 558/2014 for
the period up to 31 December 2024. The Clean Sky 2 Joint Undertaking replaced and succeeded the Clean Sky Joint Undertaking and aims to
contribute to improving the environmental impact of aeronautical technologies, including those relating to small aviation, as well as to
developing a strong and globally competitive aeronautical industry and supply chain in Europe.
As regards the JUs accounts, these are presented in detail in the document published by the Joint Undertaking (please refer to the final
accounts of the Clean Sky 2 JU).

2016/2196(DEC) - 18/10/2016 Court of Auditors: opinion, report
PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the Clean Sky 2 Joint Undertaking for the financial year
2015, together with the Joint Undertakings reply.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit focused on the annual accounts of the Clean Sky 2 Joint Undertaking (clean aeronautical technologies). As a reminder, the
objective of the Clean Sky Joint Undertaking is to contribute to the finalisation of research activities of the Seventh Research Framework
Programme (FP7) and to improving the environmental impact of aeronautical technologies, as well as to developing a strong and globally
competitive aeronautical industry and supply chain in Europe. The objectives of the Clean Sky 2 Joint Undertaking fall under the societal
challenge pillar in Horizon 2020 for Smart, Green and Integrated Transport.
Statement of assurance: pursuant to the provisions of Article 287 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the Court
has audited:
the annual accounts of the Clean Sky 2, which comprise the financial statements and the reports on the implementation of the budget
for the financial year ended 31 December 2015;
the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying those accounts.
Opinion on the reliability of the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the Joint Undertakings annual accounts present fairly, in all material respects,
its financial position as at 31 December 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with
the provisions of its financial rules and the rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
Opinion on the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the transactions underlying the annual
accounts for the year ended 31 December 2015 are, in all material respects, legal and regular.
The audit also revealed the following points:
budgetary and financial management: the Court noted that the amount of in-kind contributions entered in the final accounts is based
on the information received from the members of the Joint Undertaking other than the EU. From the reported EUR 47 million of in-kind
contributions related to H2020 operational expenses, EUR 19 million have been certified in accordance with the Council Regulation,
but not yet validated by the Governing Board, and EUR 28 million euros remained to be certified and validated.
Joint Undertakings reply: the Joint Undertaking stressed that while the members provided their estimates by 31 January 2016, the actual
declarations were received later, as many members find it difficult to present their actual figures in such a short deadline, due to longer internal
processes.
By 30 September 2016, the Joint Undertaking received and assessed most of the members financial reports which have already increased the
validated in-kind contribution by EUR 17.4 million compared to the amount reported in the final accounts.

2016/2196(DEC) - 07/02/2017 Supplementary non-legislative basic document
Having examined the revenue and expenditure accounts for the financial year 2015 and the balance sheet as at 31 December 2015 of the
Clean Sky 2 Joint Undertaking, as well as the Court of Auditors' report on the annual accounts of the Joint Undertaking for the financial year
2015, accompanied by the Joint Undertaking's replies to the Court's observations, the Council recommended the European Parliament to give
a discharge to the Executive Director of the Joint Undertaking in respect of the implementation of the budget for the financial year 2015.
The Council welcomed the Court's opinion that, in all material respects, the Joint Undertaking's annual accounts present fairly its financial

position as at 31 December 2015 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions
of the Joint Undertaking's Financial Rules, and that the underlying transactions for 2015 are legal and regular in all material respects.
Nevertheless, the Council made the following observations:
financial programming: the Council called on the Joint Undertaking to pay due attention to the proper programming and
implementation of commitment and payment appropriations in the course of the budgetary year and to decommit unused
appropriations if necessary;
planning: the Council encouraged the Joint Undertaking to implement its action plan on planning, performance monitoring and
reporting and the dissemination of research results;
conflicts of interest: the Joint Undertaking is invited to incorporate in its procedures a declaration of absence of a conflict of interest as
stated in the Commission's guidelines.

2016/2196(DEC) - 28/03/2017 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Miroslav POCHE (S&D, CZ) on discharge in respect of the implementation of the
budget of the Clean Sky 2 Joint Undertaking for the financial year 2015.
The committee called on the European Parliament to grant the joint undertakings Executive Director discharge in respect of the
implementation of the joint undertakings budget for the financial year 2015.
Noting that the Court of Auditors issued a statement of assurance as to the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the
underlying transactions for the financial year 2015, Members called on Parliament to approve the closure of the joint undertakings accounts.
They made, however, a number of recommendations that need to be taken into account when the discharge is granted. They may be
summarised as follows:
Follow-up of 2014 discharge: Members took note that the Joint Undertaking disclosed performance indicators and indicators for monitoring
cross-cutting issues in its annual activity report as required and that it achieved its targets in majority of them.
Budgetary and financial management: the Joint Undertakings final budget for 2015 included commitment appropriations of EUR 440 705 606
and payment appropriations of EUR 245 990 262. Members observed with satisfaction that the Joint Undertaking successfully faced the
challenge of managing the highest budget in its history (amounting to 192 % in commitments of the 2014 budget and 166 % in payment
appropriations of the 2014 budget). The commitment appropriations utilisation rate was 99.47 % (compared to 82.58 % in 2014) and the rate
of payment appropriations was 75.44 % (compared to 90.19 % in 2014).
Members pointed out that private sector members experienced difficulties presenting their in-kind contribution figures by the deadline of 31
January and is concerned that this could become a recurring issue.
Other observations: the report also contained a series of observations on calls for procedure, ex-ante control procedures, ex-ante control
procedures, ex-post audits, anti-fraud and internal controls.
Members appreciated that, in terms of widening participation, during the first year of Clean Sky 2 programme 76 new core partners joined the
programme and took note of the progress made by the Joint Undertaking in involving SMEs in the programme by achieving 36% participation
rate by the end 2016.
The Joint Undertaking is urged to improve the gender balance in its various bodies and to put forward a plan for realising that goal.
