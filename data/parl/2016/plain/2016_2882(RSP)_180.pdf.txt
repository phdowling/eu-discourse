Summary

2016/2882(RSP) - 15/09/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a resolution on Zimbabwe.
The text adopted in plenary had been tabled by the EPP, S&D, ECR, ALDE, Greens/EFA, EFDD and ENF groups.
The people of Zimbabwe have suffered for many years under an authoritarian regime led by President Mugabe that maintains its power
through corruption, violence, rigged elections and a brutal security apparatus.
The people of Zimbabwe have not experienced true freedom in decades and many under the age of thirty have therefore only known lives of
poverty and violent repression.
Members expressed serious concern about the increase in violence against demonstrators in Zimbabwe in recent months. In this regard, they
called on the government and all parties in Zimbabwe to respect the right to demonstrate peacefully.
Parliament expressed worry about the rise in the number of arbitrary arrests of human rights defenders and those engaging in peaceful and
lawful demonstrations and called for the release all political prisoners immediately and unconditionally.
It recalled that since May 2016 thousands of demonstrators informal traders, unemployed young people and, now, professional people have
taken to the streets in a number of urban centres across Zimbabwe to protest against job losses, mass unemployment and the governments
failure to meet peoples basic economic expectations.
Many demonstrations are now organised through social media, and the Zimbabwean authorities have blocked internet access and WhatsApp
text messaging to obstruct protest. Hundreds of people have been arrested during demonstrations. On 26 August 2016 bloody clashes took
place in the capital, Harare.
Parliament condemned the recent statements made by President Mugabe attacking the judiciary of Zimbabwe and urged the authorities of
Zimbabwe not to interfere with the independence of the judiciary.
Restrictive measures: Parliament considered that the Council and Commission should carefully analyse the appropriateness of reimposing
certain restrictive measures, while making clear that these will be removed and that a package of assistance will be made available once
Zimbabwe is clearly on the path towards democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights.
Rule of law: Parliament called for a peaceful transition of power based on a free and fair electoral process, the rule of law and respect for
human rights in order to develop a free, prosperous and pluralist democracy.
EU assistance: Parliament insisted that the EU must ensure that the funding allocated to Zimbabwe for its National Indicative Programme
effectively addresses the sectors concerned and called on the Government of Zimbabwe to allow the Commission unhindered access to the
EU-funded projects and to enhance its openness to technical assistance for jointly agreed projects and programmes.
Lastly, Parliament stressed that it is important for the EU to start up a political dialogue with the Zimbabwean authorities under Articles 8 and
96 of the Cotonou Agreement, thereby confirming the EUs commitment to supporting the local population.
