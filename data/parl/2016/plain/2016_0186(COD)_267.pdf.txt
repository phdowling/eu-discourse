Summary

PURPOSE: to amend Decision No 445/2014/EU establishing a Union action for the European Capitals of Culture for the years 2020 to 2033.
PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: in comparison with previous Decision No 1622/2006/EC, Decision No 445/2014/EU extends the action to candidate countries
and potential candidates to EU membership, providing that they participate in the Creative Europe Programme or in the subsequent Union
programmes supporting culture at the date of publication of the call for applications.
As a result, every third year starting from 2021 (i.e. in 2021, 2024, 2027, 2030 and 2033), cities from candidate countries or potential
candidates may hold the title.
However, Decision No 445/2014/EU does not include European Free Trade Association countries which are parties to the Agreement on the
European Economic Area ("EFTA/EEA countries") (Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein).
In order to reinforce the cultural links between the European Union and EFTA/EEA countries, it is proposed to modify Decision No
445/2014/EU so as to make it possible for cities from EFTA/EEA countries which participate in the Creative Europe Programme or in the
subsequent Union programmes supporting culture, to apply for the ECOC title.
Furthermore, the inclusion of EFTA/EEA countries would also be in line with Article 81 of the EEA Agreement and Article 13 of its Protocol 31
on the cooperation in specific fields outside the four freedoms.
CONTENT: in its proposal, the Commission proposes:
to open the ECOC action to the participation of cities from EFTA/EEA countries providing that these countries participate in the
Creative Europe Programme or in the subsequent Union programmes supporting culture at the date of publication of the call for
submission of applications;
in this perspective, to extend the open competition for cities from candidate countries/potential candidates to cities from EFTA/EEA
countries;
to have an ECOC title in a city from a candidate country/potential candidate or an EFTA/EEA country in 2028 instead of 2027 so as to
make it possible for these countries to negotiate their participation in the Union programme supporting culture that will follow Creative
Europe for the period 2021 to 2027 before the Commission publishes the relevant call for submission of applications at the latest six
years before the year of the title;
to modify the calendar in the Annex of Decision No 445/2014/EU accordingly.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the Commission's proposal has no direct budgetary implication, as the Melina Mercouri Prize and the costs of
the members of the expert panel designated by Union institutions and bodies are covered by the existing resources of the Creative Europe
programme for the 2014-2020 financial framework, or will be covered by the subsequent Union programmes supporting culture for the years
after 2020.
Furthermore, the proposal will not result in a higher number of European Capitals of Culture over the period from 2020 to 2033 because the
cities from EFTA/EEA countries will compete with cities from candidate countries/potential candidates which were already part of the
competition.

2016/0186(COD) - 09/03/2017 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Culture and Education adopted the report by Santiago FISAS AYXELÀ (EPP, ES) on the proposal for a decision of the
European Parliament and of the Council amending Decision No 445/2014/EU establishing a Union action for the European Capitals of Culture
for the years 2020 to 2033.
The committee recommended that the European Parliaments position adopted at first reading, following the ordinary legislative procedure,
should amend the Commission proposal as follows:
Aim: Members stressed that promoting culture shall be a priority for the Union since it is fundamental for human development, stronger political
integration and growth in aggregate income.
Union action shall:
encourage mutual understanding and intercultural dialogue and bring common cultural heritage to the forefront;
foster the contribution of culture to the smart, sustainable and inclusive development of cities and their surrounding areas in
accordance with their respective long-term strategies and priorities;
highlight the richness and diversity of European cultures and the features those cultures share, while promoting better mutual
understanding and a sense of belonging among European citizens;
have a positive impact in cultural terms, while boosting tourism and fostering the development of cities across Europe.
Members stressed the important role played by the European Capitals of Culture in promoting Union values.
Participating in the action: the Commissions proposal provides that cities in EFTA/EEA countries, candidate countries and potential candidates
shall only be allowed to participate in one competition during the period from 2020 to 2033. It stated that each EFTA/EEA country, candidate
country or potential candidate shall only be allowed to host the title once during the period from 2020 to 2033.
Members proposed that Novi Sad (Serbia), Timi?oara (Romania) and Elefsina (Greece) shall be European Capitals of Culture in 2021.
Network of European Capitals of Culture: Members suggested that recognition shall be granted to the Network of European Capitals of Culture
(NECC), comprising cities that have held the title at least once, in order to enhance the experience gained from the cultural capital scheme.
The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts concerning the regulation of the NECC. The power to adopt such acts shall be

conferred on the Commission for an indeterminate period of time from the date of entry into force of the Decision.

2016/0186(COD) - 13/06/2017 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 606 votes to 54, with 6 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a decision of the
European Parliament and of the Council amending Decision No 445/2014/EU establishing a Union action for the European Capitals of Culture
for the years 2020 to 2033.
The European Parliaments position adopted at first reading, following the ordinary legislative procedure, amended the Commission proposal.
Parliament stated that Decision No 445/2014/EU aims at:
safeguarding and promoting the richness and the diversity of cultures in Europe and at highlighting the common features they share
while increasing citizens' sense of belonging to a common cultural area, thus encouraging mutual understanding and intercultural
dialogue, and bringing common cultural heritage to the fore;
fostering the contribution of culture to the long-term development of cities, which can involve their surrounding areas, in accordance
with their respective strategies and priorities, with a view to supporting smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.
The amended text also stressed that European capitals of culture make a crucial contribution to promoting the values of the Union.
Moreover, the text stated that networking activities should be further encouraged between past, present and future cities holding the title of
European Capital of Culture, in order to foster the exchange of experiences and good practices.

2016/0186(COD) - 13/09/2017 Final act
PURPOSE: to amend Decision No 445/2014/EU establishing a Union action for the European Capitals of Culture for the years 2020 to 2033.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision (EU) 2017/1545 of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Decision No 445/2014/EU
establishing a Union action for the European Capitals of Culture for the years 2020 to 2033.
CONTENT: Decision 445/2014/EU sets out the framework for selection, designation and monitoring of the cities to be awarded the title of
European Capitals of Culture from 2020. European Capitals of Culture make a crucial contribution to promoting the values of the Union.
The European Capitals of Culture initiative aims to:
promote the richness and the diversity of cultures in Europe and at highlighting the common features they share while increasing
citizens' sense of belonging to a common cultural area, thus encouraging mutual understanding and intercultural dialogue, and
bringing common cultural heritage to the fore.
foster the contribution of culture to the long-term development of cities, which can involve their surrounding areas, in accordance with
their respective strategies and priorities, with a view to supporting smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.
Currently, the action applies to the candidate or potential candidate countries for accession to the European Union, provided that they
participate in the Creative Europe programme or in subsequent Union programmes at the date of publication of the call for applications.
The objective of amending Decision 2017/1545 is to allow access to the action to the countries of the European Free Trade Association which
are parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area (EFTA / EEA countries), namely Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein .
The Decision provides that:
cities in EFTA/EEA countries, in candidate countries and in potential candidates which participate in the Creative Europe Programme
or in the subsequent Union programmes supporting culture at the date of publication of the call for submission of applications, may
apply for the title for one year in the framework of an open competition organised in accordance with the calendar set out in the Annex;
cities in EFTA/EEA countries, in candidate countries and in potential candidates shall only be allowed to participate in one competition
during the period from 2020 to 2033;
each EFTA/EEA country, candidate country or potential candidate shall only be allowed to host the title once during the period from
2020 to 2033.
As the calls for submission of applications need to be published at the latest 6 years before the year of the title, a candidate country, potential
candidate or EFTA/EEA country should host the European Capital of Culture in 2028 instead of 2027 so as to allow those countries to
negotiate their participation in the Union programme supporting culture subsequent to the Creative Europe Programme for the period 2021 to
2027.
Networking activities should be further encouraged between past, present and future cities holding the title of European Capital of Culture in
order to foster the exchange of experiences and good practices.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 5.10.2017.
