Summary

2016/2639(DEA) - 14/04/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament decided not to raise objections to the Commission delegated regulation of 5 April 2016 correcting Delegated
Regulation (EU) 2015/2446 supplementing Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards detailed
rules concerning certain provisions of the Union Customs Code.
Members recalled that following the publication of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/24461, two errors were detected:
the first error concerns the presumption of a customs declaration laid down in Article 139 of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/2446 for
some of the types of goods referred to in Article 136(1) of that delegated regulation;
the second error concerns Article 141(1) of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/2446.
These two mistakes will affect trade flows and have a very negative impact on customs authorities and traders if they are not corrected before
1 May 2016, when the relevant provisions of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 will become applicable.
The scrutiny period of the delegated act by the European Parliament and the Council is set at two months from the date of notification, that is
to say, it runs until 5 June 2016, and may be extended by a further period of two months.
On grounds of urgency, the Commission asked on 11 March 2016 for an early confirmation of the delegated regulation before 1 May 2016 by
Parliament.
Having regard to these elements, Parliament declared that it had no objections to the delegated regulation.
