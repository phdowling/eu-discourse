2016/2045(INI) - 17/11/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Regional Development adopted an own-initiative report by Salvatore CICU (EPP, IT) on the European Union Solidarity
Fund: an assessment.
Members recalled that since it was established, the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF) has served a very useful purpose, having
mobilised, in total, EUR 3.8 billion in connection with more than 70 disasters within 24 beneficiary states and accession countries , and has
been used in response to a wide range of natural phenomena, such as earthquakes, flooding, forest fires, storms and, more recently, drought.
The instrument was comprehensively overhauled in 2014 with a view to improving and simplifying the procedures, and ensuring more rapid
response, in line with the numerous requests made over the years by Parliament. A new revision of the Fund is foreseen in the proposed
Omnibus Regulation proposed by the Commission on 14 September 2016 with a view to improving the readiness and effectiveness of
emergency relief funding.
Improve rapid reaction: while emphasising the importance of the 2014 revision, Members emphasised that, in spite of the introduction of an
advance payment mechanism upstream of the standard procedure, beneficiaries still face problems as a result of the length of the overall
process from application to payment of the final contribution.
The report stated, in this context, the need to put forward the application as soon as possible after a disaster, as well as for further
improvements in the assessment phase, and in subsequent phases, in order to facilitate the execution of payments.
Transparency and cooperation: Member States should improve their means of communication and cooperation with local and regional
authorities, both when assessing eligible damage for which EUSF financial support is requested and when preparing applications, as well as
when implementing projects to counter the effects of natural disasters.
Members called on the Commission and the Members States to improve transparency, and to guarantee public access to information
throughout the assistance mobilisation process, from the submission of an application to project closure.
Prevention and complementarity: the report called on the Member States to optimise the use of existing EU funding, in particular the five
European Structural Investment Funds, for investments to prevent natural disasters from occurring. It pointed to the importance of developing
synergies between the various Union funds and policies with a view to preventing the impact of natural disasters and, in cases where the
EUSF is activated, to guaranteeing the consolidation, and long-term sustainable development of reconstruction projects.

Whenever the EUSF is to be used, the Member State concerned should formally undertake to carry out all measures necessary for disaster
prevention and the sustainable reconstruction of the areas affected.
Members stressed that efforts to invest in climate change mitigation and adaptation must be stepped up, taking into account preventive
measures when supporting reconstruction and reforestation under the EUSF. They called on the Member States to establish risk prevention
and risk management strategies.
In the light of future reforms, the Commission is called upon to:
allow single applications to be allowed to be submitted jointly by several eligible states affected by a natural disaster at cross-border
level, whereby the cause of the disaster is the same and the effects occur at the same time, and that indirect damages be taken into
consideration in the assessment of the applications;
consider: taking into account the possibility of increasing the advance payments threshold from 10 % to 15 %, as well as of shortening
deadlines for the processing of applications from six to four weeks; (ii) the possibility of setting the eligibility threshold for regional
natural disasters at 1 % of regional GDP, and of taking into account, when assessing the requests, the level of socio-economic
development of the regions affected.
Members deplored the fact that the procedures for assessing implementation and closure reports took so long under the old regulation, and
expected closures to be carried out more efficiently and transparently under the amended regulation, and in a manner which ensures that the
Unions financial interests are protected.

2016/2045(INI) - 01/12/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 589 votes to 13, with 42 abstentions, a resolution on the European Union Solidarity Fund: an
assessment.
Utility of the Funds: Members recalled that since it was established, the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF) has served a very useful
purpose, having mobilised, in total, EUR 3.8 billion in connection with more than 70 disasters within 24 beneficiary states and accession
countries, and has been used in response to a wide range of natural phenomena, such as earthquakes, flooding, forest fires, storms and,
more recently, drought.
In line with the numerous requests made over the years by Parliament, the instrument was comprehensively overhauled in 2014 with a view to
improving and simplifying the procedures, and (i) ensuring more rapid response within six weeks following application; (ii) re-determining its
scope; (iii) establishing clear criteria for a regional disaster; (iv) strengthening disaster prevention and risk management strategies.
A new revision of the Fund is foreseen in the proposed Omnibus Regulation proposed by the Commission on 14 September 2016 with a view
to improving the readiness and effectiveness of emergency relief funding.
Improve rapid reaction: Parliament welcomed the importance of the 2014 revision as well as its main components, such as:
the introduction of advance payments, whereby up to 10 % of the anticipated financial contribution is available on demand soon after
an application for a financial contribution from the Fund has been submitted to the Commission (capped at EUR 30 million);
the eligibility of costs relating to the preparation and implementation of the emergency and recovery operations (a major Parliament
request);
the extension of the deadlines by which eligible states must make applications (12 weeks after the first damage) and set up the project
(18 months);
the introduction of a six-weeks deadline by which the Commission must respond to applications;
new provisions on the prevention of natural disasters and improvements in procedures with regard to sound financial management.
The resolution stated, in this context, the need to put forward the application as soon as possible after a disaster, as well as for further
improvements in the assessment phase, and in subsequent phases, in order to facilitate the execution of payments.
Transparency and cooperation: Members called on the Member States and the Commission to:
improve their means of communication and cooperation with local and regional authorities, both when assessing eligible damage for
which EUSF financial support is requested and when preparing applications, as well as when implementing projects to counter the
effects of natural disasters;
improve transparency, and to guarantee public access to information throughout the assistance mobilisation process, from the
submission of an application to project closure.
Prevention and complementarity: Parliament called on the Member States to optimise the use of existing EU funding, in particular the five
European Structural Investment Funds, for investments to prevent natural disasters from occurring. It pointed to the importance of developing
synergies between the various Union funds and policies with a view to preventing the impact of natural disasters and, in cases where the
EUSF is activated, to guaranteeing the consolidation, and long-term sustainable development of reconstruction projects.

prevention and the sustainable reconstruction of the areas affected.

deadlines for the processing of applications from six to four weeks; (ii) the possibility of setting the eligibility threshold for regional
natural disasters at 1 % of regional GDP, and of taking into account, when assessing the requests, the level of socio-economic
development of the regions affected.
Lastly, Parliament deplored the fact that the procedures for assessing implementation and closure reports took so long under the old
regulation, and expected closures to be carried out more efficiently and transparently under the amended regulation, and in a manner which
ensures that the Unions financial interests are protected.
