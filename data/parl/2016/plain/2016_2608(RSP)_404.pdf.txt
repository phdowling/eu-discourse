Summary

2016/2608(RSP) - 10/03/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 588 votes to 10, with 59 abstentions, a resolution on Egypt, notably the case of Giulio Regeni.
The text adopted in plenary was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ECR, ALDE, GUE/NGL, Greens/EFA and EFDD groups.
According to information available, Giulio Regeni, a 28-year-old Italian doctoral student at Cambridge University, disappeared on 25 January
2016 after leaving his home in Cairo. His body was found on 3 February 2016 next to a road on the outskirts of Cairo. The results have yet to
be made public. However, according to the Italian ambassador to Cairo, Mr Regenis body was found to have been subjected to severe beating
and multiple forms of torture.
Mr Regeni was conducting research in Cairo on the development of independent trade unions in post-Mubarak and post-Morsi Egypt, and had
contact with opponents of the government. Members noted that the case of Giulio Regeni follows a long list of enforced disappearances that
have occurred in Egypt since July 2013 and that these disappearances are met with impunity.
Parliament strongly condemned the torture and assassination under suspicious circumstances of EU citizen Giulio Regeni . It called on the
Egyptian authorities to provide the Italian authorities with all the documents and information necessary to enable a swift, transparent and
impartial joint investigation into the case of Mr Regeni, and for every effort to be made to bring the perpetrators of the crime to justice as soon
as possible.
The Universal Declaration on Human Rights is an essential element of the agreement. Moreover, the Egyptian Constitution adopted in 2014
enshrines fundamental rights and freedoms. The case of Giulio Regeni is not an isolated incident. Therefore, Members called on the European
External Action Service (EEAS) and the Member States to raise with the Egyptian authorities the routine practice of enforced disappearances
and torture and to press for effective reform of Egypts security apparatus and judiciary.
Parliament called on the Government of Egypt to guarantee that domestic and international civil society organisations and independent trade
unions can operate freely without government interference or intimidation in the country. It also called:
on it to review as a matter of urgency the repressive Protest Law of November 2013, which has been used to clamp down on all forms
of peaceful dissent, as well as the Assembly Law of 1914;
for the review of all other repressive legislation adopted in violation of Egypts Constitution, including the Law on Terrorist Acts and the
Law on Terrorist Entities, which could be misused for internal repression rather than to improve collective security.
Underlining the importance that the European Union attaches to cooperation with Egypt, the resolution insisted that only by building a truly
pluralistic society, respectful of the diversity of views and lifestyles, can long-term stability and security in Egypt be ensured. In this regard, it
called on the Egyptian authorities to commit to a reconciliation dialogue bringing together all non?violent forces, including non-violent Islamists,
in order to rebuild trust in politics and the economy in an inclusive political process.
Lastly, Parliament called on the EU, in particular the VP/HR and the EU Delegation in Cairo, to ensure regular exchanges with human rights
defenders and to report on the current state of military and security cooperation by EU Member States with Egypt, and to develop a roadmap
in close consultation with the European Parliament outlining concrete steps to be taken by the Egyptian authorities to improve significantly the
human rights situation.
