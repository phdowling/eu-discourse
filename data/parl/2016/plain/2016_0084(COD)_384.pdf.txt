Summary

2016/0084(COD) - 17/03/2016 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to guarantee the functioning of the internal market in fertilizing products while ensuring that CE marked fertilising products on the
market fulfil the requirements providing for a high level of protection of human, animal, and plant health, safety and the environment.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLEOF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: the conditions for making fertilisers available on the internal market have been partially harmonised through Regulation (EC)
No 2003/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council.
Virtually all product-types currently included in the existing Fertilisers Regulation are conventional, inorganic fertilisers, typically extracted from
mines or chemically produced in line with a linear economy model. These processes are both energy consuming and CO2-intensive.
Around 50 % of the fertilisers currently on the market are left out of the scope of the Regulation . This is true for a few inorganic fertilisers and
for virtually all fertilisers produced from organic materials, such as animal or other agricultural by products, or recycled bio-waste from the food
chain.
As a result, fertilisers sourced in line with the circular economy remain non-harmonised . Their access to the single market is therefore
dependent on mutual recognition between Member States, which is often difficult due to diverging national rules.
Furthermore, the existing Fertilisers Regulation fails to address environmental concerns arising from contamination by EC-fertilisers of soil,
inland waters, seawaters, and ultimately food.
The ex-post evaluation of the existing Fertilisers Regulation conducted in 2010 concluded that the Regulation could be more effective in
promoting innovative fertilisers, and that adjustments would also be needed to better protect the environment. The Commission proposes to
establish harmonised conditions for making fertilisers made from recycled or organic materials available on the entire internal market in order
to provide an important incentive for their further use.
IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment compared status quo (referred to as option 1) with four other policy options. Under the four
options, the scope of harmonisation would be extended to fertilisers from organic raw materials and to other fertiliser-related products, and limit
values would be introduced for contaminants.
The final proposal corresponds with the option that would build on the 'New Legislative Framework' ('NLF'), with one conformity assessment
procedure varying between material categories. This was considered to be the best policy choice because it would lead to administrative
simplification, in particular for fertilising products from well identified, primary raw materials, and ensure flexibility, while at the same time
ensuring that the use of harmonised fertilising products does not pose unacceptable risks to health or the environment.
CONTENT: the proposal seeks to repeal the existing Fertilisers Regulation and to address the problems identified in the evaluation conducted
in 2010. It has also been identified as one of the key legislative proposals under the circular economy action plan.
The main policy objective of the initiative is to incentivise large-scale fertiliser production in the EU from domestic organic or secondary raw
materials in line with the circular economy model, by transforming waste into nutrients for crops.
The draft regulation provides a regulatory framework radically easing access to the internal market for such fertilisers, thereby levelling their
playing field with that of mined or chemical fertilisers produced in line with a linear economy model. This would contribute to the following
circular economy objectives by:
allowing valorisation of secondary raw materials, hence enabling improved use of raw materials and turning eutrophication and waste
management problems into economic opportunities for public and private operators;
increasing resource efficiency and decrease import dependency for raw materials essential to European agriculture, in particular
phosphorus;
boosting investment and innovation in the circular economy, hence creating jobs in the EU;
contributing to relieving the fertilisers industry from its current pressure to reduce CO2-emissions under ETS, by allowing it to produce
fertilisers from less carbon-intensive feedstock.
A second policy objective is to address the issue of soil and food contamination and introduce harmonised cadmium limits for phosphate
fertilisers. The Regulation introduces strict limits for cadmium in phosphate fertilisers. The limits will be tightened from 60 mg/kg to 40 mg/kg
after three years and to 20 mg/kg after 12 years, reducing health and environmental risks.
To achieve these objectives, the proposal:
sets out the subject matter, scope and definitions, as well as the fundamental principles of free movement and marketability of CE
marked fertilising products. The provision on product requirements are contained in the Annexes, which include the substantive
requirements for the categories of end products in accordance with their intended function (Annex I), as well as for the categories of

component materials that can be contained in CE marked fertilising products (Annex II). Annex III specifies the labelling requirements;
lays down the obligations of economic operators involved in making CE marked fertilising products available on the market;
sets out the general principle for conformity of CE marked fertilising products. It refers to Annex IV, which describes in detail the
conformity assessment procedures applicable to CE marked fertilising products, depending on their component material categories
and their product function categories. It also refers to Annex V, which sets out the model structure for the EU declaration of conformity.
sets out the provisions on notified bodies, and on market surveillance.
DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of
the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

2016/0084(COD) - 25/07/2017 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection adopted the report by Ildikó Gáll-Pelcz (EPP, HU) on the proposal for a
regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down rules on the making available on the market of CE marked fertilising
products and amending Regulations (EC) No 1069/2009 and (EC) No 1107/2009.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety as well as the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development,
exercising their prerogatives as associated committees in accordance with Article 54 of the Rules of Procedure, also gave their opinions on the
report.
As a reminder, the proposal for a Regulation on fertilisers in the context of the circular economy package aims to harmonise European rules
for organic waste products and by-products. It modernises conformity assessment and market surveillance in accordance with the new
legislative framework for product legislation.
The committee recommended that the European Parliament's position adopted at first reading in accordance with the ordinary legislative
procedure should amend the Commission proposal as follows.
Definitions: it is proposed to replace the term fertilising product with plant nutrition product, while clarifying this definition, as well as the
definition of substance.
Recycled or organic materials: Members seek to promote increased use of recycled nutrients in order to further contribute to the development
of the circular economy while reducing the Unions dependence on nutrients imported from third countries.
Facilitating market access for innovative organic fertilisers: Members suggest facilitating compliance of phosphate fertilising products with the
requirements of this Regulation and boosting innovation by providing incentives for the development of relevant technologies, in particular
decadmiation and the management of cadmium-rich hazardous wastes through the financial resources available under the Horizon 2020
program, the LIFE programs and the Circular Economy Platform through the European Investment Bank ( EIB) or other financial instruments.
The Commission should report annually to the European Parliament and the Council on the incentives and the Union funding provided for
decadmiation.
Provide limits for contaminants: the traceability of products which are sensitive to organic pollution from certain potentially problematic sources
(or perceived as such) should be ensured back to the source of the organic material. This is necessary in order to secure consumer
confidence and to limit damage if local contamination occurs.
Obligations of economic operators: in order to protect the health and safety of consumers and the environment, manufacturers shall carry out
sample testing of fertilising products made available on the market and inform distributors and market surveillance authorities of any such
monitoring.
Only compliant CE marked fertiliser can be imported into the Union and placed on the Union market.
Importers shall indicate the third country manufacturers on the packaging of the CE marked fertilising product. Distributors shall verify that the
required information is provided in a document accompanying the fertiliser.
Members considered it important that the labelling is clear and comprehensive and that it includes all the information on the available nutrients
and their solubility. The Commission shall publish a guidance document giving details and examples to manufacturers and market surveillance
authorities about the appearance of the label.
The CE marking should be affixed in a visible, legible and indelible manner on the package
The report stated that the Regulation does not prevent Member States from maintaining or adopting provisions which are in compliance with
the Treaties, concerning the use of CE marked fertilising products for the purpose of protecting human health and the environment, provided
that those provisions do not require modification of CE marked fertilising products which are in compliance with this Regulation and do not
influence the conditions for making them available on the market.
Assessment and report: Members introduced a review clause requiring the European Commission to assess (42 months after the date of
application of the Regulation):
the functioning of the internal market for fertilisers, including the conformity assessment and market surveillance effectiveness;
the application of restrictions of contaminant levels as set out in Annex I to this Regulation and any new relevant scientific information
on the toxicity and carcinogenicity of contaminants;
developments in decadmiation technologies;
trade impacts on the sourcing of raw materials, including the availability of phosphate rock.
One year after the date of entry into force of the Regulation, the Commission shall present an evaluation of the scientific data used to establish
the agronomic and environmental criteria to define end-of-livestock manure criteria in order qualify the performance of products containing or
consisting of processed livestock manure.
Lastly, five years after the date of entry into force of the Regulation at the latest, the Commission shall review the conformity assessment
procedure of micro-organisms.

2016/0084(COD) - 24/10/2017 Text adopted by Parliament, partial vote at 1st reading/single
reading
The European Parliament adopted by 298 votes to 234, with 135 abstentions, amendments to the proposal for a regulation of the European
Parliament and of the Council laying down rules on the making available on the market of CE marked fertilising products and amending
Regulations (EC) No 1069/2009 and (EC) No 1107/2009.
The matter has been referred back to the committee responsible for interinstitutional negotiations.
As a reminder, the proposal for a Regulation on fertilisers in the context of the circular economy package aims to harmonise European rules
for organic waste products and by-products. It modernises conformity assessment and market surveillance in accordance with the new
legislative framework for product legislation.
The main amendments adopted in plenary are as follows:
Definitions: it is proposed to replace the term fertilising product with plant nutrition product, while clarifying this definition, as well as the
definition of substance.
Recycled or organic materials: Members seek to promote increased use of recycled nutrients in order to further contribute to the development
of the circular economy while reducing the Unions dependence on nutrients imported from third countries.
In this context, farmers should use those products which follow the spirit of "responsible agriculture", favouring local distribution channels. The
preferential use of fertilisers produced on-site and in neighbouring agricultural undertakings should be encouraged.
Facilitating market access for innovative organic fertilisers: Members suggest facilitating compliance of phosphate fertilising products with the
requirements of this Regulation and boosting innovation by providing incentives for the development of relevant technologies, in particular
decadmiation and the management of cadmium-rich hazardous wastes through the financial resources available under the Horizon 2020
programme, the LIFE programmes and the Circular Economy Platform through the European Investment Bank (EIB) or other financial
instruments. The Commission shall report annually to the European Parliament and the Council on the incentives and the Union funding
provided for decadmiation.
To take advantage of technical developments and unlock the potential to make more use of nutrients from animal by-products such as animal
manure, the setting of processing methods and recovery rules for animal by-products for which an end-point in the manufacturing chain has
been determined (the point beyond which they no longer represent a risk to public and animal health) should start immediately after the entry
into force of the Regulation.
Provide limits for contaminants: the traceability of products which are sensitive to organic pollution from certain potentially problematic sources
(or perceived as such) should be ensured back to the source of the organic material. This is necessary in order to secure consumer
confidence and to limit damage if local contamination occurs.
Cadmium limits: contaminants in CE marked fertilising products, if the latter are not used correctly, such as cadmium, can potentially pose a
risk to human and animal health and the environment as they accumulate in the environment and enter the food chain. According to the
amended text, the cadmium limits would be reduced from 60 mg/kg to 40 mg/kg after six years (instead of the three years proposed by the
European Commission), and to 20 mg/kg after sixteen years, to allow producers to adapt to these requirements.
Obligations of economic operators: in order to protect the health and safety of consumers and the environment , manufacturers shall carry out
sample testing of fertilising products made available on the market and inform distributors and market surveillance authorities of any such
monitoring. Manufacturers shall keep the technical documentation and the EU declaration of conformity for five years after the CE marked
fertilising product covered by those documents has been placed on the market.
Only compliant CE marked fertiliser can be imported into the Union and placed on the Union market.
Importers shall indicate the third country manufacturers on the packaging of the CE marked fertilising product. Distributors shall verify that the
required information is provided in a document accompanying the fertiliser.
Members considered it important that the labelling is clear and comprehensive and that it includes all the information on the available nutrients
and their solubility. The Commission shall publish a guidance document giving details and examples to manufacturers and market surveillance
authorities about the appearance of the label.
The CE marking should be affixed in a visible, legible and indelible manner on the package
Parliament stated that the Regulation does not prevent Member States from maintaining or adopting provisions which are in compliance with

trade impacts on the sourcing of raw materials, including the availability of phosphate rock classified by the Commission as a critical
raw material;
One year after the date of entry into force of the Regulation, the Commission shall present an evaluation of the scientific data used to establish
the agronomic and environmental criteria to define end-of-livestock manure criteria in order qualify the performance of products containing or
consisting of processed livestock manure.

Lastly, five years after the date of entry into force of the Regulation at the latest, the Commission shall review the conformity assessment
