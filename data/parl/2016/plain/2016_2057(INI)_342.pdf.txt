2016/2057(INI) - 14/02/2017 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety adopted an own-initiative report by Soledad CABEZÓN RUIZ (S&D, ES)
on the EU options for improving access to medicines.
Members recalled that public health systems are crucial to guaranteeing universal access to health care, a fundamental right of European
citizens. Health systems in the EU face challenges such as an ageing population, the increasing burden of chronic illnesses, the high cost of
development of new technologies, high and rising pharmaceutical expenses, and the effects of the economic crisis on healthcare spending.
These challenges prompt the need for European cooperation and new policy measures at both EU and national level.
The report called for national and EU-wide measures to guarantee the right of patients to universal, affordable, effective, safe and timely
access to essential and innovative therapies, to guarantee the sustainability of EU public healthcare systems, and to ensure future investment
in pharmaceutical innovation.
Among other recommendations, Members called on the Commission and the Member States to:

reinforce the negotiation capacities of Member States in order to ensure affordable access to medicines across the EU;
develop closer collaboration in order to fight such market fragmentation and to work on shared criteria to instruct price and
reimbursement decisions at national level;
propose a new directive on transparency of price-setting procedures and reimbursement systems;
implement Directive 2011/24/EU on the application of patients rights in cross-border healthcare in a fair way, avoiding limitations to the
application of the rules on reimbursement of cross-border healthcare, including the reimbursement of medicine;
foster R&D driven by patients unmet needs, such as by researching new antimicrobials, coordinating public resources for healthcare
research in an effective and efficient manner, and promoting the social responsibility of the pharmaceutical sector;
promote initiatives for guiding public and private-sector research towards bringing out innovative medicines for curing childhood
illnesses;
promote public and private-sector research into medicines for female patients;
adopt strategic plans to ensure access to life-saving medicines; Members called in this regard, for the coordination of a plan to
eradicate hepatitis C in the EU;
establish framework conditions in the areas of research and medicine policy to be established in a way that promotes innovation,
particularly against diseases, such as cancer, that cannot yet be treated to a satisfactory degree;
set up a framework to promote, guarantee and reinforce the competitiveness and use of generic and biosimilar medicines,
guaranteeing their faster entry onto the market and monitoring unfair practices;
evaluate the implementation of the regulatory framework for orphan medicines (especially as regards the concept of unmet medical
need, how this concept is interpreted and what criteria need to be fulfilled in order to identify unmet medical need), to provide guidance
on priority unmet medical need;
promote ethical behaviour and transparency in the pharmaceutical sector, especially regarding clinical trials and the real cost of R&D,
in the authorisation and assessment of innovation procedure;
observe and reinforce the EU competition legislation and its competencies on the pharmaceutical market in order to counter abuse
and promote fair prices for patients;
propose legislation on a European system for health technology assessment as soon as possible;
increase cooperation between the Member States as regards price-setting procedures.
The Commission is called upon to analyse the overall impact of intellectual property on innovation on, and on patient access to, medicines, by
means of a thorough and objective study, as requested by the Council in conclusions of 17 June 2016, and, in particular, to analyse in this
study the impact of supplementary protection certificates (SPCs), data exclusivity and market exclusivity on the quality of innovation and
competition.
Lastly, Members urged the Commission and the Member States to launch a high-level strategic dialogue with all the relevant stakeholders,
together with representatives of the Parliament on current and future developments in the pharmaceutical system in the EU, with the aim of
establishing short-, medium- and long-term holistic strategies for ensuring access to medicines and for the sustainability of healthcare systems
and a competitive pharmaceutical industry, leading to affordable prices and faster access to medicines for patients.

2016/2057(INI) - 02/03/2017 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 568 votes to 30, with 52 abstentions, a resolution on the EU options for improving access to medicines.
Parliament recalled that public health systems are crucial to guaranteeing universal access to health care, a fundamental right of European
citizens. Health systems in the EU face challenges such as an ageing population, the increasing burden of chronic illnesses, the high cost of
development of new technologies, high and rising pharmaceutical expenses, and the effects of the economic crisis on healthcare spending.
These challenges prompt the need for European cooperation and new policy measures at both EU and national level.
Pharmaceutical market, competition and pricing: Parliament highlighted the importance of both public and private R&D efforts in discovering
new treatments. However, it stressed that the high level of public funds used for R&D is not reflected in the pricing which impedes a fair public
return on public investment.
Members called for national and EU-wide measures to guarantee the right of patients to universal, affordable, effective, safe and timely access
to essential and innovative therapies, to guarantee the sustainability of EU public healthcare systems, and to ensure future investment in
pharmaceutical innovation.
Deploring the litigation cases aiming to delay generic entry, Members pointed out that biosimilar medicines enable increased competition and
that their market entry should not be delayed.
Members stressed the importance of assessing the real therapeutic, evidence-based added value of new medicines. The price of a medicine
should cover the cost of the development and production of that medicine and should be in line with the therapeutic added value it brings to
patients.
Main recommendations: Parliament called on the Commission and the Member States to:
reinforce the negotiation capacities of Member States in order to ensure affordable access to medicines across the EU;
develop closer collaboration in order to fight such market fragmentation and to work on shared criteria to instruct price and
reimbursement decisions at national level;
propose a new directive on transparency of price-setting procedures and reimbursement systems;
set up a framework to reinforce the competitiveness and use of generic and biosimilar medicines, guaranteeing their faster entry onto
the market and monitoring unfair practices;
observe and reinforce the EU competition legislation and its competencies on the pharmaceutical market in order to counter abuse
and promote fair prices for patients;
propose legislation on a European system for health technology assessment as soon as possible.
The resolution also called for the:
fostering of R&D driven by patients unmet needs, such as by researching new antimicrobials, given that drug-resistant diseases could

cause 10 million deaths annually worldwide up to 2050;
promotion of research in areas such as rare diseases and paediatric diseases;
adoption of strategic plans to ensure access to life-saving medicines (for instance the coordination of a plan to eradicate hepatitis C in
the EU);
establishment of framework conditions in the areas of research and medicine policy to be established in a way that promotes
innovation, particularly against diseases, such as cancer, that cannot yet be treated to a satisfactory degree;
evaluation of the implementation of the regulatory framework for orphan medicines;
promotion of ethical behaviour and transparency in the pharmaceutical sector, especially regarding clinical trials and the real cost of
R&D, in the authorisation and assessment of innovation procedure.
Intellectual property: the Commission is called upon to analyse the overall impact of intellectual property on innovation on, and on patient
access to, medicines, by means of a thorough and objective study, as requested by the Council in conclusions of 17 June 2016, and, in
particular, to analyse in this study the impact of supplementary protection certificates (SPCs), data exclusivity and market exclusivity on the
quality of innovation and competition.
Lastly, Members urged the Commission and the Member States to launch a high-level strategic dialogue with all the relevant stakeholders,
together with representatives of the Parliament on current and future developments in the pharmaceutical system in the EU.
