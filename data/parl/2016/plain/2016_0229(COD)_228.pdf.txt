2016/0229(COD) - 19/07/2016 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to amend Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 laying down the Union Customs Code, as regards goods that have temporarily left the
customs territory of the Union by sea or air in order to ensure effective customs supervision.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the Council and the European Parliament.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: with a view to facilitating trade flows, Article 136 of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 excludes the application of certain
provisions of that Regulation to goods that have temporarily left the customs territory of the Union while moving between two Union ports or
airports without stopping outside the Union.
Those provisions are the rules governing the obligation to lodge the entry summary declaration, the rules governing the obligation to notify the
arrival of a sea-going vessel or an aircraft, the rules governing the obligation to convey the goods to certain places and to present them to the
customs authorities at the point in which they are unloaded or transhipped, and the rules governing temporary storage.
As a result, there is no legal basis for requiring the presentation of the goods that are unloaded or transhipped at the point where the goods

re-enter the customs territory of the Union after having temporarily left it. Without presentation, it may be more difficult for customs authorities
to ensure the supervision of those goods, and there is a risk both, that import duty and other charges are not correctly levied, and that
non-fiscal measures such as veterinary and phytosanitary controls are not properly applied.
CONTENT: the proposal aims to modify Article 136 UCC in order to ensure the effective application of other UCC provisions, notably those on
customs supervision.
Under the proposal, the only provisions not applying when non-Union goods re-enter the Union customs territory after having temporarily left it
by direct sea or air route, should be:
the rules governing the obligation to lodge the entry summary declaration (Articles 127 to 130 UCC) and (2) The rules governing the
obligation to notify the arrival of a sea-going vessel or aircraft to the customs office of first entry to the Union customs territory (Article
133 UCC).
by contrast, the provisions governing the obligation to convey the goods to a certain place, to present them to customs upon unloading
or transhipment, to wait for authorisation before unloading or transhipping, and the provisions on temporary storage should apply in
these situations, thereby allowing appropriate customs supervision.
The situation should be similar for Union goods whose status needs to be proven pursuant to Article 153(2) UCC, to the extent that the
customs authorities must be able to check the proof of their Union status.
Lastly, the rules governing the obligation to present the goods to customs upon unloading or transhipment and the obligation to wait for
authorisation before unloading or transhipping the goods should not apply to Union goods that have retained their status by virtue of the
Regulation having regard to the fact that, even if the goods have temporarily left the Union customs territory, their status has not been altered
and does not need to be proven.
This amendment should enter into force as soon as possible so as to contribute to effective customs supervision.

2016/0229(COD) - 14/11/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection adopted the report by Maria GRAPINI (S&D, RO) on the proposal for a
regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 laying down the Union Customs Code, as
regards goods that have temporarily left the customs territory of the Union by sea or air.
The committee recommended that Parliament adopt its position in first reading, taking over the Commission proposal.
To recall, Article 136 of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the Union Customs Code
(UCC) excludes the application of certain provisions of that Regulation to goods that have temporarily left the customs territory of the Union
while moving between two Union ports or airports without stopping outside the Union.
Those provisions are the rules governing: (i) the obligation to lodge the entry summary declaration, (ii) the obligation to notify the arrival of a
sea-going vessel or an aircraft, (iii) the obligation to convey the goods to certain places and to present them to the customs authorities at the
point in which they are unloaded or transhipped, and (iv) temporary storage.
As a result, there is no clear legal basis for requiring the presentation of the goods that are unloaded or transhipped at the point where the
goods re-enter the customs territory of the Union after having temporarily left it. In absence of a clear legal basis to require presentation of
these goods to the customs authorities, it is more difficult for customs authorities to ensure the supervision of those goods.
The current proposal to amend Article 136 is aimed at closing this gap and thereby ensuring equal treatment of goods and providing again the
legal basis that was already established through the old customs code.

2016/0229(COD) - 01/12/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 621 votes to 20, with 2 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 laying down the Union Customs Code, as regards goods that
have temporarily left the customs territory of the Union by sea or air.
Parliament adopted its position at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure by approving the Commission proposal unamended.
As a reminder, Article 136 of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the Union Customs
Code (UCC) excludes the application of certain provisions of that Regulation to goods that have temporarily left the customs territory of the
Union while moving between two Union ports or airports without stopping outside the Union.
Those provisions are the rules governing: (i) the obligation to lodge the entry summary declaration, (ii) the obligation to notify the arrival of a
sea-going vessel or an aircraft, (iii) the obligation to convey the goods to certain places and to present them to the customs authorities at the
point in which they are unloaded or transhipped, and (iv) temporary storage.
The proposal aims to modify Article 136 UCC in order to ensure the effective application of other UCC provisions , notably those on customs
supervision by establishing a distinction between the situation of non-Union and Union goods.
Under the proposal, the only provisions not applying when non-Union goods re-enter the Union customs territory after having temporarily left it
by direct sea or air route, should be:
the rules governing the obligation to lodge the entry summary declaration (Articles 127 to 130 UCC);
the rules governing the obligation to notify the arrival of a sea-going vessel or aircraft to the customs office of first entry to the Union
customs territory (Article 133 UCC).
By contrast, the provisions governing the obligation to convey the goods to a certain place, to present them to customs upon unloading or

transhipment, to wait for authorisation before unloading or transhipping, and the provisions on temporary storage should apply in these
situations, thereby allowing appropriate customs supervision.
The situation should be similar for Union goods whose status needs to be proven pursuant to Article 153(2) UCC, to the extent that the
customs authorities must be able to check the proof of their Union status.

2016/0229(COD) - 14/12/2016 Final act
PURPOSE: to amend the Union Customs Code as regards goods that have temporarily left the customs territory of the Union by sea or air in
order to ensure effective customs supervision.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Regulation (EU) 2016/2339 of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 laying
down the Union Customs Code, as regards goods that have temporarily left the customs territory of the Union by sea or air.
CONTENT: this Regulation amends the Union Customs Code in order to improve customs supervision for goods that have temporarily left the
EU's customs territory while moving between two Union ports or airports, without stopping outside the EU's customs territory.
The Regulation seeks to ensure the correct application of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013. It amends Article 136 UCC in order to ensure the
effective application of other UCC provisions, notably those on customs supervision by establishing a distinction between the situation of
non-Union and Union goods.
Under the Regulation, the only provisions not applying when non-Union goods re-enter the Union customs territory after having temporarily left
it by direct sea or air route, should be:
the rules governing the obligation to lodge the entry summary declaration (Articles 127 to 130 UCC);
the rules governing the obligation to notify the arrival of a sea-going vessel or aircraft to the customs office of first entry to the Union
customs territory (Article 133 UCC).
By contrast, the provisions governing the obligation to convey the goods to a certain place, to present them to customs upon unloading or
transhipment, to wait for authorisation before unloading or transhipping, and the provisions on temporary storage should apply in these
situations, thereby allowing appropriate customs supervision.
The situation should be similar for Union goods whose status needs to be proven pursuant to Article 153(2) UCC, to the extent that the
customs authorities must be able to check the proof of their Union status.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 24.12.2016.
