2016/2099(INI) - 30/03/2017 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs adopted an own-initiative report by Georgios KYRTSOS (EPP, EL) on the Annual Report
on the Financial Activities of the European Investment Bank.
The Committee on Budgets, exercising its prerogative as an associated committee in accordance with Article 54 of the Rules of Procedure,
also gave its opinion on the report.
Investment in the EU: the report stressed the urgent need for the EIB to participate in the reduction of the investment gap on the basis of
sound economic criteria. The current context should encourage the bank to adopt more ambitious objectives and to increase lending signed by
it.
Members took the view that an increase in EIB lending activity could be achieved through better synergies with public funds, which would in
turn boost public and private investment. They stressed that such an increase should be accompanied by a corresponding diversification of the
EIBs product range, including a greater and fiscally prudent use of public-private partnerships (PPP).
The EIB should give priority to innovation-based projects and give support to indigenous energy sources. It should also use a wide range of
financial instruments to support public and private investment in transport.

Members underlined that combating all forms of harmful tax practices should remain an important priority of the EIB.
The EIB is invited to present a comprehensive assessment of the potential impact that the UKs decision to leave the EU might have on its
financial status and activities.
Supporting SMEs: Members supported the emphasis placed by the EIB on the financing of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), with
37 % of the new lending granted in 2015 (EUR 28.4 billion). The EIBs support for microfinance was particularly successful, with just EUR 184
million microcredits sustaining 230 500 jobs in microenterprises.
The EIB is called upon to:
target and report not only jobs sustained, but also jobs created by its funding activities, and aim at complying with ILO standards;
devise a strategy to increase their financing in countries with unfavourable economic and banking environments; particular attention
should also be paid to competitive and agile very small enterprises in need of financing, micro-enterprises and micro-entrepreneurs.
Innovation and competitiveness: Members welcomed the strong increase in EIB lending to innovative projects, which stood at EUR 18.7 billion
in 2015, as compared to less than EUR 10 billion in 2008. They suggested increasing this lending to focus on the development of technologies
for the future, such as energy-efficiency transport, robotics, the bio economy, the digital economy and new medical treatments for a better life.
Tackling youth unemployment: the report called on the EIB to develop its strategic planning programme in order to tackle high levels of
unemployment and continue to invest in education and human capital in order to equip young people with the necessary set of skills to provide
them with access to finance linked to the employment of young people in SMEs and mid-caps.
The EIB should relax the conditionality for benefitting firms in regions with youth unemployment above 25 % so as to boost young
entrepreneurship and support firm creation.
Climate action: Members called on the EIB to step up its involvement in the fight against climate change, which was linked to 27 % of the
projects approved in 2015 and accounted for a total investment of EUR 20.6 billion the largest ever annual amount invested in climate change
by the EIB.
The EIB is encouraged to support sustainable and innovative transport solutions, to continue to promote accessibility for passengers with
reduced mobility, to invest in clean energy and in modern transport services through specialised funding tools, such as the European clean
transport facility and to support investment in sustainable urban mobility, ideally based on sustainable urban mobility plans.
Refugee crisis and migration within the EU: Members asked the EIB to continue its action to tackle migrant and refugee flows by financing
emergency projects in destination and transit countries and, where possible, by making long-term commitments to projects which aim to create
jobs and boost growth in the countries of origin. The EIB is also invited to continue its social housing project lending.
The report welcomed the EIBs commitment to tackle the phenomenon of forced migration and to take action in countries particularly affected
by the migration crisis. It called on the EIB to rapidly implement the Migration for ACP countries package.
External lending mandate: Members recalled that the external policy of the EIB, and in particular the regional technical operational guidelines,
should be consistent with the external action goals of the EU. They insisted on the coherence and streamlining of all EU external action
financial instruments.
The EIB is invited to:
reinforce its capacity to assess projects according to their impact on Agenda 2030 goals;
ensure, as regards its development operations under the Cotonou Agreement, compliance with EU treaty obligations, with the EU
Strategic Framework and Action Plan for Human Rights, with the European Charter of Fundamental Rights;
improve the ex-ante and ex-post assessment of the impact of its projects outside the EU and take account of the local context when
investing in third countries;
increase transparency and accountability due to the EIBs Results Measurement (ReM) Framework;
provide Parliament with an annual overview of payment deferrals and losses incurred in its sustainable development funding;
focus its attention closely on developing countries, particularly those suffering from conflict and extreme poverty.
Lastly, the Commission is called upon to establish a framework for annual reporting by the EIB on its operations outside the EU as regards
compliance with the general principles guiding the Unions external action.

2016/2099(INI) - 27/04/2017 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 431 votes to 134, with 34 abstentions, a resolution on the Annual Report on the Financial Activities of
the European Investment Bank.
Investment in the EU: Parliament insisted on the urgent need for the EIB to participate in the reduction of the investment gap and the bank to
adopt more ambitious objectives and to increase lending signed by it.

turn boost public and private investment. They stressed that such an increase should be accompanied by a corresponding diversification of the
EIBs product range, including a greater and fiscally prudent use of public-private partnerships (PPP).
The EIB is called upon to:
further support EU countries under adjustment programmes in order to contribute to jumpstarting their economic recovery and to
favour their transition to a sustainable economy;
focus its efforts on more effective and energy efficient investment.
boost its technical assistance in order to address low project generation capacity and to help Member States to identify fundable
projects;
give priority to innovation-based projects which offer clear added European value;

step up its assessment of projects, paying particular attention to the number and quality of direct and indirect jobs created;
coordinate various types of EU funding in order to ensure that EU transport policy objectives are met across all of the EU.
Combating all forms of harmful tax practices should remain an important priority of the EIB.
The EIB is invited to present a comprehensive assessment of the potential impact that the UKs decision to leave the EU might have on its

The EIB should relax the conditionality for benefitting firms in regions with youth unemployment above 25 % so as to boost young
entrepreneurship and support firm creation.
Members recalled the need to support local SME projects pursuing sustainable and long-term investments and providing employment in the
fields of innovation, R&D and energy efficiency.
Climate action: Members called on the EIB to step up its involvement in the fight against climate change, which was linked to 27 % of the
projects approved in 2015 and accounted for a total investment of EUR 20.6 billion the largest ever annual amount invested in climate change
by the EIB.
The EIB is encouraged to:
support sustainable and innovative transport solutions;
continue to promote accessibility for passengers with reduced mobility;
bring about a modal shift from road to rail and waterborne and inland waterway transport;
invest in clean energy and in modern transport services through specialised funding tools, such as the European clean transport
facility;
support investment in sustainable urban mobility, ideally based on sustainable urban mobility plans.
Refugee crisis and migration within the EU: Members asked the EIB to continue its action to tackle migrant and refugee flows by financing
