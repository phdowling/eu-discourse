Summary

2016/2794(RSP) - 14/09/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a resolution on the proposal for a Council directive implementing the Agreement concluded between the
General Confederation of Agricultural Cooperatives in the European Union (COGECA), the European Transport Workers Federation (ETF)
and the Association of National Organisations of Fishing Enterprises (EUROPÊCHE) of 21 May 2012 as amended on 8 May 2013 concerning
the implementation of the Work in Fishing Convention, 2007, of the International Labour Organisation.
This Agreement applies to all fishers employed on board a fishing vessel which is registered in, or flying the flag of, an EU Member State and
which is engaged in commercial fishing operations.
By incorporating the Agreement of the social partners on the ILO Work in Fishing Convention into EU legislation, the EU will be in a stronger
position to promote its implementation in partner countries worldwide, thereby contributing to a fair and level playing field for the global fishing
sector, including the fight against the worst forms of exploitation of fishers , such as forced labour, trafficking and child labour.
Members stated that workers in the fisheries sector require special protection, considering, among other things, the special characteristics of
work on board fishing vessels. The high rate of fatal and non-fatal accidents, as well as the risk and incidence of occupational diseases, in
comparison with other sectors.
Members noted the unclear distinction between work hours, rest and leisure, and the impact on health and safety of fatigue resulting, in part,
from insufficient rest.
Therefore, Parliament took note of the Commission proposal for a Council directive implementing the Agreement concluded between the
COGECA, the ETF and EUROPÊCHE but regretted the delay in presenting the social partners agreement, finalised in 2013, to the Council.
While welcoming the fact that the Agreement as concluded by the social partners and the Commission proposal provide only for minimum
requirements, allowing Member States and/or social partners to adopt measures which are more favourable to workers in the area concerned,
Parliament recommended its immediate adoption.
Lastly, it underlined the need to develop those provisions related to wages, social protection and social security in order to ensure an adequate
and decent income for workers and their families, including in the case of injury, accident or death.
