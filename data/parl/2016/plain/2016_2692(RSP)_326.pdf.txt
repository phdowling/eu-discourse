Summary

2016/2692(RSP) - 12/05/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a resolution on the Crimean Tatars.
The resolution was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ECR, ALDE and Greens/EFA groups.
Parliament strongly condemned the decision of the so-called Supreme Court of Crimea to ban the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People, and
demanded its immediate reversal. Parliament considered this decision to constitute systemic and targeted persecution of the Crimean Tatars,
and to be a politically motivated action aimed at further intimidating the legitimate representatives of the Tatar community.
It pointed out that the ban on the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People, which is the legitimate and recognised representative body of the
indigenous people of Crimea, will provide fertile ground for stigmatising the Crimean Tatars, further discriminating against them and violating
their human rights and basic civil liberties. Parliament is concerned that the branding of the Mejlis as an extremist organisation may lead to
additional charges in accordance with provisions of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
Supporting the Crimean Tatar Assembly: Parliament recalled that on 26 April 2016 the so-called Supreme Court of Crimea ruled in favour of a
request by the so-called Prosecutor-General of Crimea, Natalia Poklonskaya, accusing the Mejlis, which had been the representative body of
the Crimean Tatars since its establishment in 1991 and had enjoyed full legal status since May 1999, of extremism, terrorism, human rights
violations, illegal actions and acts of sabotage against the authorities. The banning of the Mejlis means that it will be prohibited from
convening, publishing its views in the mass media, holding public events or using bank accounts. Therefore, Parliament called for the EU to
provide financial support for the activities of the Mejlis while it is in exile.
Recalling the sad second anniversary of the illegal annexation of the Crimean peninsula by the Russian Federation on 20 February 2014,
Parliament recalled its severe condemnation of that act, which was in breach of international law and called for consideration to be given to
extending the list of people targeted by EU sanctions in relation to the banning of the Mejlis.
Respecting territorial integrity of Ukraine: Parliament reconfirmed its full commitment to the sovereignty, political independence, unity and
territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognised borders and its free and sovereign choice to pursue a European path. It called
on all parties to immediately pursue peaceful reintegration of the occupied Crimean peninsula into the Ukrainian legal order through political
dialogue and in full compliance with international law.
Restrictions on freedom of expression: Parliament condemned the severe restrictions on the freedoms of expression, association and peaceful
assembly, including at traditional commemorative events such as the anniversary of the deportation of the Crimean Tatars by Stalins
totalitarian Soviet Union regime and at cultural gatherings of the Crimean Tatars. It regretted the fact that discriminatory policies applied by the
so-called authorities are preventing the return of these properties and resources, or are being used as an instrument to buy support. Russia is
called upon to uphold the legal order in Crimea and protect citizens from arbitrary judicial or administrative measures and rulings.
It called for permanent and unimpeded access to Crimea for the relevant international human rights bodies, with the aim of monitoring the
human rights situation. It also called for the preservation of the historical and traditional multicultural environment of Crimea and for full respect
for Ukrainian, Tatar and other minority languages and distinctive cultures.
Parliament called on Russia to investigate all cases of torture of prisoners illegally apprehended in Crimea and to end the politically motivated
prosecution of dissidents and civic activists. It also reiterated its grave concern regarding the situation of LGBTI people in Crimea, which has
substantially worsened following the Russian annexation.
