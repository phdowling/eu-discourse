2016/2189(DEC) - 11/07/2016 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: presentation by the Commission of the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2015, as part of
the 2015 discharge procedure.
Analysis of the accounts of the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER).
CONTENT: the organisational governance of the EU consists of institutions, agencies and other EU bodies whose expenditure is included in
the general budget of the Union.
The EU's operational expenditure of these institutions takes different forms, depending on how the money is paid out and managed.
From 2014 onwards, the Commission classifies its expenditure as follows:
Direct management: the budget is implemented directly by the Commission services.
Indirect management: the Commission confers tasks of implementation of the budget to bodies of EU law or national law, such as the
EU agencies.
Shared management: under this method of budget implementation tasks are delegated to Member States. About 80 % of the
expenditure falls under this management mode covering such areas as agricultural spending and structural actions.
This Commission document concerns the EU's consolidated accounts for the year 2015 and details how spending by the EU institutions and
bodies was carried out. The consolidated annual accounts of the EU provide financial information on the activities of the institutions, agencies
and other bodies of the EU from an accrual accounting and budgetary perspective.
It is the responsibility of the Commission's Accounting Officer to prepare the EU's consolidated annual accounts and ensure that they present
fairly, in all material aspects, the financial position, the result of the operations and the cash flows of the EU institutions and bodies, including
the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER), with a view to granting discharge.
Discharge procedure: the final step of a budget lifecycle is the discharge of the budget for a given financial year. It represents the political
aspect of the external control of budget implementation and is the decision by which the European Parliament, acting on a Council
recommendation, "releases" the Commission (and other EU bodies) from its responsibility for management of a given budget by marking the

end of that budget's existence. The European Parliament is the discharge authority within the EU.
The discharge procedure may produce three outcomes: (i) the granting; (ii) postponement or; (iii) the refusal of the discharge.
The final discharge report including specific recommendations to the Commission for action is adopted in plenary by the European Parliament
and are subject to an annual follow up report in which the Commission outlines the concrete actions it has taken to implement the
recommendations made.
Each agency is subject to its own discharge procedure, including the ACER.
The Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER): the Agency, which is located in Ljubljana (SI), was set up by Regulation (EU)
No 713/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council with a view to helping the Member States regulatory authorities in the areas of
electricity and natural gas. Its aim is to give an opinion on any of the issues relating to the purpose for which it has been established.
As regards the Agencys accounts, these are presented in detail in the document on the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union
for 2015:
Commitment appropriations:
-

committed: EUR 11 million;

-

paid: EUR 14 million;

-

carried-over: 0.

Payment appropriations:
-

committed: EUR 11 million;

-

paid: EUR 22 million;

-

carried-over: EUR 2 million.

2016/2189(DEC) - 13/09/2016 Court of Auditors: opinion, report
PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the Agency for Cooperation of Energy Regulators
(ACER) for the year 2015, together with the Agencys reply.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit focused on the annual accounts of the Agency for Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER). As a reminder, the Agency's main
task is to assist National Regulatory Authorities in exercising, at Union level, the regulatory tasks that they perform in the Member States and,
where necessary, to coordinate their action.
Statement of assurance: pursuant to the provisions of Article 287 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the Court
has audited:
the annual accounts of the Authority, which comprise the financial statements and the reports on the implementation of the budget for
the financial year ended 31 December 2015; and
the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying those accounts.
Opinion on the reliability of the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the Agencys annual accounts present fairly, in all material respects, its
financial position as at 31 December 2015 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the
provisions of its Financial Regulation and the accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
Opinion on the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the transactions underlying the annual
accounts for the year ended 31 December 2015 are legal and regular in all material respects.
The report also made a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of the Agency, accompanied by the latters
response. The main observations may be summarised as follows:
The Courts observations:
budgetary management: as regards operational expenditure, the Court stated that the Agency carried over EUR 1.36 million. These
carry-overs were mainly related to the implementation of REMIT (EUR 1.1 million), a complex operational activity on wholesale energy
market integrity and transparency of a multiannual nature. The Agency also carried over EUR 0.79 million of administrative
expenditure, mainly related to studies and services not yet delivered in 2015.
The Agencys reply:
budgetary management: the Agency acknowledged the identified level of appropriations carried over, due to open commitments at
year-end, mainly stemming from the long-term nature of the REMIT project implementation. Given the persistent uncertainty on the
annual budgetary allocation to the Agency, it is difficult to reconcile the principle of annuality with the inevitable multiannual nature of
the REMIT project.
Lastly, the Court of Auditors report contained a summary of the Authoritys key figures in 2015:
Budget: EUR 11.3 million.
Staff: 80 including officials, temporary and contract staff and seconded national experts.

2016/2189(DEC) - 07/02/2017 Supplementary non-legislative basic document
Having examined the revenue and expenditure accounts for the financial year 2015 and the balance sheet as at 31 December 2015 of the
Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER), as well as the Court of Auditors' report on the annual accounts of the Agency for
the financial year 2015, accompanied by the Agency's replies to the Court's observations, the Council recommended the European Parliament
to give a discharge to the Director of the Agency in respect of the implementation of the budget for the financial year 2015.
The Council welcomed the Court's opinion that, in all material respects, the Agency's annual accounts present fairly its financial position as at
31 December 2015 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions of the
Agency's Financial Regulation, and that the underlying transactions for 2015 are legal and regular in all material respects.
Nevertheless, one observation was made:
financial programming: the Council noted a high level of commitment appropriations carried over to 2016. It encouraged the Agency to
continue improving its financial programming and monitoring of the budget implementation, in order to reduce the level of
commitments carried over to the following financial year to the minimum strictly necessary.

2016/2189(DEC) - 31/03/2017 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Inés AYALA SENDER (S&D, ES) on discharge in respect of the implementation of
the budget of the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) for the financial year 2015.
The committee called on the European Parliament to grant the Director of the Agency discharge in respect of the implementation of the
Agencys budget for the financial year 2015.
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it had obtained reasonable assurance that the annual accounts of the Agency for the financial year
2015 were reliable and that the underlying transactions were legal and regular, Members called on Parliament to approve the closure of the
Agencys accounts. They made, however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is granted,
in addition to the general recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU
agencies:
Agencys financial statements: Members noted that the final budget of the Agency for the financial year 2015 was EUR 11 266 000,
representing an increase of 3.55 % compared to 2014. They recalled that the Agencys entire budget derives from the Union budget.
Budget and financial management: Members noted that budget monitoring efforts during the financial year 2015 resulted in a budget
implementation rate of 95.09 %, reaching the Agencys planned target and representing an increase of 0.09 % compared with 2014.
Commitments and carry-overs: Members stressed that carry-overs may often be partly or fully justified by the multiannual nature of the
agencies operational programmes and do not necessarily indicate weaknesses in budget planning and implementation nor are they
always at odds with the budgetary principle of annuality. They noted the fact that the Agency found it difficult to reconcile the principle
of annuality with the multi-annual nature of the REMIT implementation project.
Members also made a series of observations regarding procurement, recruitment procedures and internal audits.
Lastly, as regards the prevention and management of conflicts of interests, Members stated that the Agencys administrative board published
the declarations of conflicts of interests on its website. However, it pointed out that some CVs and declarations of the members of the board of
regulators remain missing. They called on the Agency to provide further information about this issue to the discharge authority.

2016/2189(DEC) - 27/04/2017 Final act
PURPOSE: to grant discharge to the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) for the financial year 2015.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision (EU) 2017/1633 of the European Parliament on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of
the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators for the financial year 2015.
CONTENT: with the present decision, the European Parliament grants discharge to the Director of the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy
Regulators discharge in respect of the implementation of the Agency's budget for the financial year 2015.
This decision is in line with the European Parliament's resolution adopted on 27 April 2017 and comprises a series of observations that form
an integral part of the discharge decision (please refer to the summary of the opinion of 27 April 2017).
Amongst Parliaments main observations in the resolution accompanying the discharge decision, the latter regretted that although the Agency's
administrative board adopted the policy for the prevention and management of conflicts of interests, some CVs and declarations of the
members of the board of regulators remain missing from the website. Parliament called for these documents to be published.
Parliament recalled, as it did the previous year, that the Agency has repeatedly signalled to the host Member State the urgency of the
establishment of a European School in Ljubljana. It deplored the fact that, more than four years after the entry into force of the agreement
between the Agency and the Slovenian Government, no European School has been set up.

2016/2189(DEC) - 27/04/2017 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament decided to grant the Director of the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) discharge in respect
of the implementation of Authoritys budget for the financial year 2015.

The vote on the decision on discharge covers the closure of the accounts (in accordance with Annex IV, Article 5 (1) (a) to Parliaments Rules
of Procedure).
Noting that the Court of Auditors has stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the Agencys annual accounts for the financial year
2015 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Parliament adopted by 508 votes to 117 with 10 abstentions, a
resolution containing a series of recommendations, which form an integral part of the decision on discharge and which add to the general
recommendations set out in the resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies.
These recommendations may be summarised as follows:
Agencys financial statements: Parliament noted that the final budget of the Agency for the financial year 2015 was EUR 11 266 000,
representing an increase of 3.55 % compared to 2014. It recalled that the Agencys entire budget derives from the Union budget.
Budget and financial management: Parliament noted that budget monitoring efforts during the financial year 2015 resulted in a budget
implementation rate of 95.09 %, reaching the Agencys planned target and representing an increase of 0.09 % compared with 2014.
Commitments and carry-overs: Parliament stressed that carry-overs may often be partly or fully justified by the multiannual nature of
the agencies operational programmes and do not necessarily indicate weaknesses in budget planning and implementation nor are
they always at odds with the budgetary principle of annuality. It noted the fact that the Agency found it difficult to reconcile the principle
of annuality with the multi-annual nature of the REMIT implementation project.
Parliament also made a series of observations regarding procurement, recruitment procedures and internal audits.
On performance, Parliament noted that in late 2015 the Agency launched a survey enabling stakeholders to assess its regulatory activities,
working methods and efficiency. It stated that in October 2015 the Agency released a study for a methodology proposal to evaluate the impact
of the gas network codes and guidelines in terms of implementation and market effects . It asked the Agency to keep the discharge authority
informed on the matter.
Lastly, as regards the prevention and management of conflicts of interests, Parliament stated that the Agencys administrative board published
the declarations of conflicts of interests on its website. However, it pointed out that some CVs and declarations of the members of the board of
regulators remain missing. It called on the Agency to provide further information about this issue to the discharge authority.
