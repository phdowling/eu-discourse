2016/2052(INI) - 31/10/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Foreign Affairs adopted the own-initiative report by Urmas PAET (ALDE, EE) on the European Defence Union.
The report recalled that in recent years the security situation in and around Europe has worsened significantly, due to challenges, like
terrorism, hybrid threats or cyber and energy insecurity, that no country is able to tackle alone.
According to Members, the current financial and security context requires European armed forces to collaborate closer and military personnel
to train and work more and better together. According to a Eurobarometer study, approximately two thirds of EU citizens would like to see
greater EU engagement in matters of security and defence policy.
Call for a European Defence Union (EDU): Members encouraged the European Council to lead the progressive framing of a common Union
defence policy and to provide additional financial resources to ensure its implementation, with a view to its establishment under the next
multiannual political and financial framework of the EU (MFF). They recalled that the creation of the common Union defence policy is a
development and implementation of the Common Security and Defence Policy under the Lisbon Treaty, which is bound by international law
and is actually indispensable to enable the EU to promote the rule of law, peace and security globally.
Member States are urged to make more binding commitments to one another by establishing permanent structured cooperation within the
Union framework. Members also encouraged the setting-up of an EU Operational Headquarters as a precondition for effective planning,
command and control of common operations.
The European Council is invited to take concrete steps towards the harmonisation and standardisation of the European armed forces, in order
to facilitate the cooperation of armed forces personnel under the umbrella of a new European Defence Union.
The Parliament is called upon to establish a full-fledged Committee on Security and Defence to monitor the implementation of permanent
structured cooperation.
Funding: considering that the worsening perception of risks and threats in Europe make the establishment of the European Defence Union a
matter of urgency, Members are convinced that the use of EU funds would be a clear expression of cohesion and solidarity, and that this
would allow all Member States to improve their military capabilities in a more common effort. They stated that the Union should dedicate own
means to fostering greater and more systematic European defence cooperation among its Member States, including permanent structured
cooperation (PESCO).
Noting the ongoing work on setting up a preparatory action for a future EU defence research programme, Members urged its effective launch

as soon as possible. The preparatory action should be provided with a sufficient budget, of at least EUR 90 million for the next three years
(2017-2020). The preparatory action should be followed by a major dedicated EU-funded research programme as part of the next MFF starting
in 2021. The European Defence Research Programme will need a total budget of at least EUR 500 million per year over that period in order to
be credible and make a substantial difference.
Launch initiatives: Members considered that the following initiatives should be launched immediately:
the preparatory action on CSDP research starting in 2017, which will be continued until 2019;
a more ambitious and strategic defence research programme;
a European defence semester to assess the progress made in the Member States defence-related budgetary efforts;
a strategy outlining the steps to take to realise the establishment and implementation of the European Defence Union;
consideration of the creation of a permanent Council of defence ministers;
development of the regular White Book process, for a first application in the framework of the planning of the next MFF;
reform of the EU battlegroups concept, aiming at the establishment of permanent units which would be independent of any lead nation
and subject to systematic joint training;
creation of the military start-up fund, which would help launch military CSDP operations much faster;
an action plan to provide more Community funds for EU missions (Athena mechanism);
bring together major companies and stakeholders of the European defence industry with the aim of developing a European drone
industry;
an EU-wide system for the coordination of the rapid movement of defence forces personnel, equipment and supplies. Member States
are called upon to aim for the target of 2 % of GDP for defence spending, and to spend 20 % of their defence budgets on equipment
identified as necessary through the EDA;
strengthen EU-NATO relations, including stepping up cooperation, in particular to counter hybrid and cyber threats, and to avoid
wasteful competition.
Lastly, the report proposed that the European Defence Union be launched as a matter of urgency, in two stages and on the basis of a system
of differentiated integration:
activation of permanent structured cooperation, which has already been approved by Parliament and included in the Commission
Presidents New Start programme;
implementation of the action plan for the VP/HRs global foreign policy and security strategy.

2016/2052(INI) - 22/11/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 359 votes to 255, with 70 abstentions, a resolution on the European Defence Union (EDU).
Background: Members recalled that in recent years the security situation in and around Europe has worsened significantly, due to challenges,
like terrorism, hybrid threats or cyber and energy insecurity, organised crime and climate change, as well as other threats that no single
country or organisation is able to face alone. Solidarity and resilience require the EU to stand and to act together and systematically, and to do
so in concert with our allies and partners and third countries. Prevention, the sharing of sensitive security information, ending armed conflict,
overcoming widespread human rights abuses, the spread of democracy and the rule of law and the fight against terrorism are priorities for the
EU and its citizens and should be the subject of engagement within as well as outside the EUs borders.
According to Members, the current financial and security context requires European armed forces to collaborate closer and military personnel
to train and work more and better together. According to a Eurobarometer study, approximately two thirds of EU citizens would like to see
greater EU engagement in matters of security and defence policy.
Call for a European Defence Union (EDU): Parliament encouraged the European Council to lead the progressive framing of a common Union
defence policy and to provide additional financial resources to ensure its implementation, with a view to its establishment under the next
multiannual political and financial framework of the EU (MFF). It recalled that the creation of the common Union defence policy is a
development and implementation of the Common Security and Defence Policy under the Lisbon Treaty, which is bound by international law
and is actually indispensable to enable the EU to promote the rule of law, peace and security globally.
Members considered that the way to an EDU needs to start from a thoroughly revised CSDP, based on a strong defence principle, efficient
financing and coordination with NATO. They also highlighted the need for the establishment of a Council format of Defence Ministers to
provide sustained political leadership and coordinate the framing of a European Defence Union.
Member States are urged to make more binding commitments to one another by establishing permanent structured cooperation within the
Union framework. Members also encouraged the setting-up of an EU Operational Headquarters as a precondition for effective planning,
command and control of common operations.
The European Council is invited to take concrete steps towards the harmonisation and standardisation of the European armed forces, in order
to facilitate the cooperation of armed forces personnel under the umbrella of a new European Defence Union.
The Parliament is called upon to establish a full-fledged Committee on Security and Defence to monitor the implementation of permanent
structured cooperation.
Funding: Members stated that the Union should dedicate own means to fostering greater and more systematic European defence cooperation
among its Member States. They are convinced that the use of EU funds would be a clear expression of cohesion and solidarity, and that this
would allow all Member States to improve their military capabilities in a more common effort. They believe that strengthening the EUs
capabilities through joint procurement and other forms of pooling and sharing could provide a much-needed boost to Europes defence
industry, SMEs included. Members supported targeted measures to incentivise such projects, in order to reach the EDA benchmark of 35 % of
total spending in collaborative procurement.
Noting the ongoing work on setting up a preparatory action for a future EU defence research programme, Parliament urged its effective launch
as soon as possible. The preparatory action should be provided with a sufficient budget, of at least EUR 90 million for the next three years
(2017-2020). The preparatory action should be followed by a major dedicated EU-funded research programme as part of the next MFF starting

in 2021.
