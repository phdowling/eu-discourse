2016/2195(DEC) - 11/07/2016 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: presentation by the Commission of the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2015, as part of
the 2015 discharge procedure.
Analysis of the accounts of the SESAR Joint Undertaking to develop the new generation European air traffic management.
CONTENT: the organisational governance of the EU consists of institutions, agencies and other EU bodies whose expenditure is included in
the general budget of the Union.
The EU's operational expenditure of these institutions takes different forms, depending on how the money is paid out and managed.
From 2014 onwards, the Commission classifies its expenditure as follows:
Direct management: the budget is implemented directly by the Commission services.
Indirect management: the Commission confers tasks of implementation of the budget to bodies of EU law or national law, such as the
EU agencies.
Shared management: under this method of budget implementation tasks are delegated to Member States. About 80 % of the
expenditure falls under this management mode covering such areas as agricultural spending and structural actions.
This Commission document concerns the EU's consolidated accounts for the year 2015 and details how spending by the EU institutions and
bodies was carried out. The consolidated annual accounts of the EU provide financial information on the activities of the institutions, agencies
and other bodies of the EU from an accrual accounting and budgetary perspective.

It is the responsibility of the Commission's Accounting Officer to prepare the EU's consolidated annual accounts and ensure that they present
fairly, in all material aspects, the financial position, the result of the operations and the cash flows of the EU institutions and bodies, including
the SESAR JU, with a view to granting discharge.
Discharge procedure: the final step of a budget lifecycle is the discharge of the budget for a given financial year. It represents the political
aspect of the external control of budget implementation and is the decision by which the European Parliament, acting on a Council
recommendation, "releases" the Commission (and other EU bodies) from its responsibility for management of a given budget by marking the
end of that budget's existence. The European Parliament is the discharge authority within the EU.
The discharge procedure may produce three outcomes: (i) the granting; (ii) postponement or; (iii) the refusal of the discharge.
The final discharge report including specific recommendations to the Commission for action is adopted in plenary by the European Parliament
and are subject to an annual follow up report in which the Commission outlines the concrete actions it has taken to implement the
recommendations made.
Each agency is subject to its own discharge procedure, including the SESAR JU.
The SESAR Joint Undertaking: the SESAR JU, located in Brussels (BE), was set up in 2007 by Regulation (EC) 219/2007 for a period
extending to 31 December 2017. The aim of this Joint Undertaking is to ensure the modernisation of the European air traffic management
system and the rapid implementation of the European air traffic management Master Plan by coordinating and concentrating all relevant
research and development efforts in the EU.
As regards SESARs accounts, these are presented in detail in the document published by the Joint Undertaking (please refer to the final
accounts of the SESAR JU).

2016/2195(DEC) - 18/10/2016 Court of Auditors: opinion, report
PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the SESAR Joint Undertaking for the financial year
2015, together with the Joint Undertakings reply.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit focused on the annual accounts of the SESAR Joint Undertaking (research programme on air traffic management ATM - in the
Single European Sky). The SESAR project is divided into three phases:
a definition phase (2004-2007) led by the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation (Eurocontrol), with co-financing from
the European Union budget through the Trans-European Networks Transport (TEN-T) programme. The outcome was the European
ATM Master Plan, which defines the content and describes the development and deployment of the next generation of ATM systems;
a two-term development phase (20082013, extended to 2015) managed by the SJU and leading to the production of new
technological systems, components and operational procedures as defined in the European ATM Master Plan;
a deployment phase (2014-2024) to be led by industry and stakeholders for the large-scale production and implementation of the new
ATM infrastructure.
Statement of assurance: pursuant to the provisions of Article 287 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the Court
has audited:
the annual accounts of the SESAR Joint Undertaking, which comprise the financial statements and the reports on the implementation
of the budget for the financial year ended 31 December 2015;
the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying those accounts.
Opinion on the reliability of the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the Joint Undertakings annual accounts present fairly, in all material respects,
its financial position as at 31 December 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with
the provisions of its financial rules and the rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
Opinion on the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the transactions underlying the annual
accounts for the year ended 31 December 2015 are, in all material respects, legal and regular.
The audit also revealed the following points:
budget and financial management: of the total operational commitments made in 2015 (EUR 74.5 million), 29 % were individual
commitments based on completed award procedures for grants and contracts. The remaining 71 % were global commitments for
which the award procedure was not completed. The high level of global commitments in 2015 is due to the fact that the first Horizon
2020 calls for proposals for EUR 51.5 million in grants were launched in the second half of 2015, and the related agreements would be
signed in 2016.
Reply from the Joint Undertaking: the Joint Undertaking sought to highlight that the delay of two months for the first Horizon 2020 calls was
beyond its control. The main reason was significant changes to the IT tool for grant preparation and evaluation. Therefore, when strictly
following the Horizon 2020 grant procedures, the first grant agreements could only be signed in January 2016. The related unused 2015
payment appropriations were fully reintroduced into the 2016 budget.

2016/2195(DEC) - 07/02/2017 Supplementary non-legislative basic document
Having examined the revenue and expenditure accounts for the financial year 2015 and the balance sheet as at 31 December 2015 of the

SESAR Joint Undertaking, as well as the Court of Auditors' report on the annual accounts of the Joint Undertaking for the financial year 2015,
accompanied by the Joint Undertaking's replies to the Court's observations, the Council recommended the European Parliament to give a
discharge to the Executive Director of the Joint Undertaking in respect of the implementation of the budget for the financial year 2015.
The Council welcomed the Court's opinion that, in all material respects, the Joint Undertaking's annual accounts present fairly its financial
position as at 31 December 2015 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions
of the Joint Undertaking's Financial Rules, and that the underlying transactions for 2015 are legal and regular in all material respects.
Nevertheless, some observations were by the Council:
financial programming: the Council called on the Joint Undertaking to pay due attention to the proper programming and
implementation of commitment and payment appropriations in the course of the budgetary year and to decommit unused
appropriations if necessary;
governance: the Council encouraged the Joint Undertaking to implement its action plan on operational governance and the Master
Plan update without delay;
conflict of interest: lastly, the Council invited the Joint Undertaking to incorporate in its procedures a declaration of absence of a
conflict of interest as stated in the Commission's guidelines.

2016/2195(DEC) - 28/03/2017 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Miroslav POCHE (S&D, CZ) on discharge in respect of the implementation of the
budget of the SESAR Joint Undertaking for the financial year 2015.
The committee called on the European Parliament to grant the joint undertakings Executive Director discharge in respect of the
implementation of the joint undertakings budget for the financial year 2015.
Noting that the Court of Auditors issued a statement of assurance as to the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the
underlying transactions for the financial year 2015, Members called on Parliament to approve the closure of the joint undertakings accounts.
They made, however, a number of recommendations that need to be taken into account when the discharge is granted. They may be
summarised as follows:
Budget and financial management: 2015 was the first year of real transition from SESAR 1 (funded from FP 7 and TEN-T) to SESAR 2 (funded
from Horizon 2020). The final budget for SESAR1 for the financial year 2015 included commitment appropriations of EUR 30 229 774 and
payment appropriations of EUR 126 733 842. The final budget for SESAR 2020 for the financial year 2015 included commitment
appropriations of EUR 51 470 000 and payment appropriations of EUR 10 300 000. The utilisation rates for commitment and payment
appropriations were 100 % and 82.3 %, respectively. The payment appropriations rate of 82.3 % was due to delay of two months for the first
Horizon 2020. Related unused 2015 payment appropriations were fully reintroduced into the 2016 budget.
Other observations: the report also contained a series of observations on procurement and recruitment procedures, the prevention and
management of conflicts of interests, calls for proposal, internal audits and control systems.
In July 2015, the Commission issued guidelines to the Joint Undertakings related to rules on conflicts of interest, including a common template
for the declaration of absence of a conflict of interest. Members urged the Joint Undertaking to reflect those guidelines in its procedures and to
report to the discharge authority on the completion of the aforementioned declarations.
The report noted that the Administrative Board adopted in December 2015 the ATM Master Plan (2015 Edition) covering both SESAR
development and deployment. It welcomed the development of a SESAR vision 2035+.
Members welcomed the successful delivery of the work mandated by the Commission concerning the Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems
(RPAS) definition phase.
Lastly, they highlighted the vital role of the Joint Undertaking in coordinating and implementing research into the SESAR project.
