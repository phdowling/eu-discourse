2016/2017(INI) - 02/08/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Womens Rights and Gender Equality adopted the joint own-initiative
report by Tatjana DANOKA (Greens/EFA, LV) and Vilija BLINKEVI?I?T? (S&D, LT) on creating labour market conditions favourable for
work-life balance.
Members recalled that in 2014, 5.1 million children were born in the EU-28, corresponding to a crude birth rate of 10.1. In comparison, this rate
was 10.6 in 2000, 12.8 in 1985 and 16.4 in 1970. Hence, the EU faces a serious demographic challenge owing to the ever-decreasing birth
rates in most Member States.
In this context, Members felt that well designed and well-implemented reconciliation policies might greatly promote economic growth,
competitiveness, overall labour market participation, gender equality, reduction of the risk of poverty, and positively influences birth rates in the
EU.
Reconciliation of professional and private life as a fundamental right: Members pointed out that reconciliation of professional, private and
family life is a wide-ranging concept that embraces all overarching policies of a legislative and non-legislative nature aimed at promoting
appropriate and proportionate balance between the various aspects of peoples lives. Reconciliation of professional, private and family life
needs to be guaranteed as a fundamental right for all, with measures being available for everyone, going beyond young mothers, fathers or
carers.
Members called for the introduction of a framework to ensure this right as a basic aim of social systems and called on the EU and the Member
States to promote, in both the public and private sectors, business welfare models respecting the right to a work-life balance.
To meet the challenges of unprecedented demographic changes, Members called on the Commission and the Member States to put in place
positive policies and incentives to support demographic renewal, preserve social security systems and promote the well-being and
development of people and of society as a whole. They felt it was necessary to promote family-friendly working environments, reconciliation
plans, return-to-work programmes, communication channels between employees and employers, and incentives for businesses and
self-employed workers, in particular to ensure that people are not economically penalised for having children.
Measures to promote reconciliation: the committee called for legislative and non-legislative measures regarding the reconciliation of
professional, private and family life. The Commission was called upon to put forward a proposal for such a package as part of the Commission
Work Programme 2017. Members stressed that legislative proposals should include equality between men and women as a legal basis.
These measures should include provisions that support those who are most disadvantaged or currently excluded from existing legislation ,
such as single parents, unmarried couples, same-sex couples, migrants, self-employed people or so-called assisting spouses, and families in
which one or more members have a disability. The well-being and best interests of children should be one of the primary considerations.
Reconciliation and gender equality: Members underlined that a better work-life balance and strengthened gender equality is essential for
supporting the participation of women in the labour market. They called on the Commission and Member States to develop transformative
policies and to invest in awareness-raising campaigns to overcome gender stereotypes and to promote a more equal sharing of care and
domestic work. Member States should step up protection against discrimination and unlawful dismissal related to work-life balance.
Furthermore, the lack of comparable, comprehensive, reliable and regularly updated equality data makes it more difficult to prove the
existence of discrimination. Members called on the Commission to take initiatives to further promote such data collection and establish
relevant indicators in this area.
Governance and reconciliation: the committee considered it necessary that adequate training on non-discrimination legislation in employment
and case law be provided for employees of national, regional and local authorities and law enforcement bodies, and for labour inspectors. It
called on Member States, together with the Commission, to guarantee that rights to social entitlements assigned by public policies are equal in
terms of individual rights and equally accessible for women and men, in order to ensure that everyone can enjoy their rights and to enable
them to achieve a better work-life balance.
Women and men as equal earners and equal carers: Members called on Member States to put in place proactive policies and appropriate

investment designed to support women and men entering, returning to, staying and advancing in the labour market, after periods of family and
care-related types of leave. They also urged Member States to replace household unit models by the individualisation of taxation and social
security rights in order to ensure that women have individual rights and to counter dependency status through their partners or through the
state.
Family- and care-related types of leave: noting that the Commission has withdrawn the revision of the Maternity Leave Directive, Members
called for an ambitious proposal with high-level standards, in order to ensure a better work-life balance. The Commission and Member States
must ensure that women are paid and covered by social protection for the duration of maternity leave.
The Commission should also propose:
·

a paternity leave directive with a minimum of a compulsory two-week fully paid leave;

·

a carers leave directive which supplements the provision of professional care, enables workers to care for dependants and offers the carer
adequate remuneration and social protection;

·

minimum standards applicable in all Member States to address the specific needs of adoptive parents and children and to establish the same
rights as for natural parents.
Care for dependants: the report called on Member States to examine the possibility of gradually bringing school hours into line with full-time
working hours, by means of free out-of-school activities both at the end of the school day and in school holiday times, in order to help workers
achieve real balance between their working, family and private lives. It also called on Member States to support fiscal policies as a powerful
lever enhancing work-life balance and to foster employment of women, by introducing a tax credit for child care and care of elderly or other
dependants based on fiscal incentives and benefits.
Quality employment: Members pointed out the high levels of working poor throughout Europe, with some people having to work more and
longer, even combining several jobs, in order to earn a living wage. They pointed out that work-life balance must be based on workers rights
and security on the labour market, and on the right to take time off without it being curtailed by increased mobility and flexibility requirements.
In this context, they supported smart working as an approach to organising work through a combination of flexibility, autonomy and
collaboration, which does not necessarily require the worker to be present in the workplace or in any pre-defined place and enables them to
manage their own working hours, while nevertheless ensuring consistency with the maximum daily and weekly working hours laid down by law
and collective agreements.
Members went on to point out that excessive and irregular working hours and insufficient rest periods are major factors in increased levels of
stress, poor physical and mental health and occupational accidents and diseases.
They called for measures to increase quality of life, which refers to the overall well-being of individuals in a society. In this context, they called
on Member States to promote measures aiming to put in place adequate minimum income schemes, in line with national practices and
traditions, to enable all people to live a life in dignity, to support their full participation in society and to ensure independence throughout the life
cycle.

2016/2017(INI) - 13/09/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 443 votes to 123 with 100 abstentions, a resolution on creating labour market conditions favourable for
work-life balance.
Parliament recalled that in 2014, 5.1 million children were born in the EU-28, corresponding to a crude birth rate of 10.1. In comparison, this
rate was 10.6 in 2000, 12.8 in 1985 and 16.4 in 1970. Hence, the EU faces a serious demographic challenge owing to the ever-decreasing
birth rates in most Member States.
Faced with unprecedented demographic challenges, Parliament called on the Commission and the Member States to put in place positive
policies and incentives to support demographic renewal, preserve social security systems and promote the well-being and development of
people and of society as a whole.
In this context, it felt that well designed and well-implemented reconciliation policies might greatly promote economic growth, competitiveness,

Parliament called for the introduction of a framework to ensure this right as a basic aim of social systems and called on the EU and the
Member States to promote, in both the public and private sectors, business welfare models respecting the right to a work-life balance.

Reconciliation and gender equality: Parliament underlined that a better work-life balance and strengthened gender equality is essential for
supporting the participation of women in the labour market. It called on the Commission and Member States to develop transformative policies
and to invest in awareness-raising campaigns to overcome gender stereotypes and to promote a more equal sharing of care and domestic

on Member States, together with the Commission, to guarantee that rights to social entitlements assigned by public policies are equal in terms
of individual rights and equally accessible for women and men, in order to ensure that everyone can enjoy their rights and to enable them to
achieve a better work-life balance.
Women and men as equal earners and equal carers: Parliament stressed the need to eliminate gender inequalities in paid and unpaid work
and to promote equal sharing of responsibilities, costs and care for children and for dependants between women and men, but also within
society as a whole.
It called on Member States to put in place proactive policies and appropriate investment designed to support women and men entering,
returning to, staying and advancing in the labour market, after periods of family and care-related types of leave.
It urged the Commission, therefore, to adopt a post-2015 Gender Equality Strategy in line with the recommendations of the European Pact for
gender equality for the period 2011-2020.
Family- and care-related types of leave: noting that the Commission has withdrawn the revision of the Maternity Leave Directive, Members
called for an ambitious proposal with high-level standards, in order to ensure a better work-life balance. The Commission and Member States
must ensure that women are paid and covered by social protection for the duration of maternity leave.
The Commission should also propose:
a paternity leave directive with a minimum of a compulsory two-week fully paid leave;
a carers leave directive which supplements the provision of professional care, enables workers to care for dependants and offers the
carer adequate remuneration and social protection;
minimum standards applicable in all Member States to address the specific needs of adoptive parents and children and to establish
the same rights as for natural parents.
It also called on Member States to provide adequate income replacement and social protection during any type of family- or care-related leave ,
in particular to ensure that low-income workers can benefit from leave measures on an equal footing with others.
As regards parental leave, Parliament called on the Commission and the social partners to consider offering an appropriate extension of the
minimum duration of parental leave with adequate income replacement and social protection from four to at least six months and to increase
the age of the child for which parental leave can be taken.
It considered that promoting the individualisation of the right to leave arrangements, as well as the role of fathers in bringing up their children
by taking up leave, is essential to achieving a gender-balanced reconciliation of work and private life.
Against this backdrop, it called on the Member States to introduce care credits through labour and social security legislation for both women
and men as equivalent periods for building up pension rights in order to protect those taking a break from employment to provide informal,
unpaid care to a dependant or a family member.
Care for dependants: Parliament called on the Member States to support fiscal policies as a powerful lever enhancing work-life balance and to
foster employment of women. It stressed that the care of children with disabilities presents a particular challenge for working parents, which
should be recognised by society and supported by public policies. It called on the Member States, in providing pre-school childcare, to place
emphasis not only on accessibility, but also on the quality of that care, in particular for children from disadvantaged backgrounds and children
with disabilities.
Quality employment: Parliament pointed out the high levels of working poor throughout Europe, with some people having to work more and
longer, even combining several jobs, in order to earn a living wage.
Member States and the social partners are called upon to develop a wage policy framework with effective measures combating wage
discrimination and ensuring adequate wages for all workers, for example through the introduction of minimum wages at national level that
guarantee a life in dignity.
Parliament pointed out that work-life balance must be based on workers rights and security on the labour market, and on the right to take time
off without it being curtailed by increased mobility and flexibility requirements. Increased flexibility can result in an intensification of the labour
market discrimination currently experienced by women in the shape of lower wages, non-standard forms of employment and disproportionate
responsibility for unpaid household tasks.
In this context, it supported smart working as an approach to organising work through a combination of flexibility, autonomy and collaboration,
which does not necessarily require the worker to be present in the workplace or in any pre-defined place and enables them to manage their
own working hours, while nevertheless ensuring consistency with the maximum daily and weekly working hours laid down by law and
collective agreements.
Parliament went on to point out that excessive and irregular working hours and insufficient rest periods are major factors in increased levels of
stress, poor physical and mental health and occupational accidents and diseases.
It called for measures to increase quality of life, which refers to the overall well-being of individuals in a society. Members called on Member
States to promote measures aiming to put in place adequate minimum income schemes, in line with national practices and traditions, to enable
all people to live a life in dignity, to support their full participation in society and to ensure independence throughout the life cycle.
