2016/0064(COD) - 04/03/2016 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to amend Regulation (EU, EURATOM) No 883/2013, as regards the secretariat of the Supervisory Committee of the European
Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: in accordance with the new OLAF Regulation (Regulation 883/2013), the Supervisory Committee of the European Anti-Fraud
Office is tasked with regularly monitoring the implementation by the Office of its investigative function, in order to reinforce its independence,
and in particular to monitor developments concerning the application of procedural guarantees and the duration of investigations in the light of
the information supplied by the Director General.
However, in the recent past some concerns have been voiced about possible conflicts of interest and calls have been made for a strengthened
legal independence as regards the management of the Committee's budget and secretariat. Thus, in its Annual Activity Reports of 2013 and
2014, the Supervisory Committee underlined the importance of its independent and effective functioning which requires an independent and
adequately staffed secretariat.
The European Parliament called several times on the Commission to take measures to reinforce the independent functioning of OLAF's
Supervisory Committee secretariat, such as in its report on the discharge procedure for 20134 or in its resolution on the OLAF Supervisory
Committee's annual report 2014.
On 18 December 2015, the Commission adopted an amendment to its Decision 1999/352 in order to move the responsibility for the
implementation of the budgetary appropriations for the Members from the Director-General of OLAF to the Commission. The Commission
subsequently delegated this responsibility to the Director of its Payments Office (PMO). This decision applied as from 1 January 2016.
The framework for the implementation of the budgetary appropriations relating to the Members of the Supervisory Committee should be set up
in a way which avoids any appearance of a possible interference of the Office in their duties . The secretariat of the Supervisory Committee
should be provided directly by the Commission, independently from the Office. The Commission should refrain from interfering with the
functions of the Supervisory Committee.
CONTENT: in order to separate the management of the Committee's secretariat from the management of the Office and to avoid any
impression that OLAF can impair the functioning of the support to the Committee's Members, the Commission proposes to modify Regulation
883/2013 to foresee that the secretariat of the Supervisory Committee will be provided directly by the Commission, and no longer by OLAF .
Lastly, the proposal seeks to amend the wording of Regulation so that the competence of OLAF's Data Protection Officer (DPO) will continue
to cover the processing of data by the secretariat. Also, the secretariat's staff will continue to be subject to the same confidentiality rules as
before.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposed Regulation will not require any new human or administrative resources and will have no financial
impact. It will only transfer the management of the budgetary appropriations concerning the secretariat of OLAF's Supervisory Committee
within the Commission.

2016/0064(COD) - 05/04/2016 Court of Auditors: opinion, report
COURT OF AUDITORS OPINION No 1/2016 concerning a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending
Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013, as regards the secretariat of the Supervisory Committee of the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).
The Court welcomed the proposal that the secretariat of the Supervisory Committee should no longer be provided by OLAF. However, the new
provisions could be completed in order to clarify that the secretariat must act independently not only of OLAF but also of the Commission and
that it is under the authority of the Supervisory Committee.
The Court noted that the upcoming overall evaluation of the OLAF Regulation in 2017 will be an opportunity to examine and, if necessary,
overhaul the governance of OLAF including its supervisory arrangements. However, the Court suggested not to wait for this overall evaluation
to clarify the procedure for lifting the immunity of the Director-General of OLAF or of any other member of OLAF staff at the request of a
national judicial authority.
The Court therefore recommended that Article 17 of the OLAF Regulation should be completed by a provision that the Commission has to
inform the Supervisory Committee of any such request in a timely manner and has to consult the Committee before taking a decision.

2016/0064(COD) - 27/05/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Ingeborg GRÄSSLE (EPP, DE) on the proposal for a regulation of the European
Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013, as regards the secretariat of the Supervisory Committee of
the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).
The committee recommended that the European Parliaments position adopted at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure
should adopt its position at first reading, taking over the Commission proposal.

To recall, the proposal aims to strengthen the independence of the OLAF Supervisory Committees Secretariat, thus providing for a more
effective functioning of the Supervisory Committee.
In the past the European Parliament called several times on the Commission to take measures to reinforce the independent functioning of the
OLAF Supervisory Committees secretariat, for example in its report on the discharge procedure for 2013 or in its resolution on the OLAF
Supervisory Committee's annual report 2014.
Under the new proposed Regulation, the secretariat of the Supervisory Committee will be provided by the Commission, and no longer by
OLAF.

2016/0064(COD) - 06/07/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 670 vote to 34, with 6 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013, as regards the secretariat of the Supervisory
Committee of the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).
To recall, the proposal aims to strengthen the independence of the OLAF Supervisory Committees Secretariat, thus providing for a more
effective functioning of the Supervisory Committee.
Under the new proposed Regulation, the secretariat of the Supervisory Committee will be provided by the Commission, and no longer by
OLAF.
The European Parliaments position, adopted at first reading under the ordinary legislative procedure, amended the Commission as follows:
Confidentiality and data protection: Parliament stated that the staff of the Office and the staff of the secretariat of the Supervisory Committee
shall refrain from any unauthorised disclosure of information received in the exercise of their functions, unless that information has already
been lawfully made public or is accessible to the public.
Moreover, the members of the Supervisory Committee shall be bound by the same obligation of professional secrecy in the exercise of their
functions, and shall continue to be bound by that obligation after the end of their mandate.
Guarantee the independence of the Supervisory Committee: before the appointment of any staff to the secretariat, the Supervisory Committee
shall be consulted and its views shall be taken into account. The secretariat shall act on the instructions of the Supervisory Committee and
independently from the Commission. Without prejudice to its control over the budget of the Supervisory Committee and its secretariat, the
Commission shall not interfere with the monitoring functions of the Supervisory Committee.
An amendment also stipulated that officials assigned to the secretariat of the Supervisory Committee shall neither seek nor take instructions
from any government or any institution, body, office or agency relating to the exercise of the monitoring functions of the Supervisory
Committee.
Parliament took note of the Commission statement annexed to the resolution in which the Commission is committed to ensure the independent
functioning of the Secretariat of the OLAF Supervisory Committee. This attachment will be of a purely administrative nature, with a view to
facilitating certain organisational and budgetary aspects.
The Commission will consider, after consulting the Supervisory Committee, putting in place appropriate internal rules on mobility limiting the
duration of the postings of the Secretariat, while ensuring continuity in order to render their independence effective, and avoid risks of conflicts
of interests or of revolving doors issues with OLAF.

2016/0064(COD) - 26/10/2016 Final act
PURPOSE: to amend Regulation (EU, EURATOM) No 883/2013, as regards the secretariat of the Supervisory Committee of the European
Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2016/2030 of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU, Euratom)
No 883/2013, as regards the secretariat of the Supervisory Committee of the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).
CONTENT: in accordance with Regulation 883/2013, the Supervisory Committee of the European Anti-Fraud Office is tasked with regularly
monitoring the implementation by the Office of its investigative function, in order to reinforce its independence.
This Regulation amends Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 so as to enable the framework for the implementation of the budgetary
appropriations relating to the members of the Supervisory Committee to be set up in a way that avoids any appearance of a possible
interference of the Office in their duties, while guaranteeing the same transparency of the appropriations for the operation of the Supervisory
Committee as before.
In order to ensure that the Supervisory Committee functions effectively and efficiently, its secretariat should be provided directly by the
Commission, independently from the Office, and the Commission should provide the secretariat with appropriate means to fulfil its function. In
order to safeguard the Supervisory Committee's independence, the Commission should refrain from interfering with the monitoring functions of
the Supervisory Committee.
The staff of the Office and the staff of the secretariat of the Supervisory Committee shall refrain from any unauthorised disclosure of
information received in the exercise of their functions, unless that information has already been lawfully made public or is accessible to the
public, and shall continue to be bound by that obligation after leaving the service.
The members of the Supervisory Committee shall be bound by the same obligation of professional secrecy in the exercise of their functions,
and shall continue to be bound by that obligation after the end of their mandate.
