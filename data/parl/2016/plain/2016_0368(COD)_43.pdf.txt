2016/0368(COD) - 29/11/2016 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to repeal obsolete Regulations in the area of transport.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: this proposal for repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 1101/89, Regulations (EC) No 2888/2000 and (EC) No 685/2001 is
submitted in the context of the Commission's REFIT programme and commitment on better regulation.
The objective is to ensure a legislative framework that is fit for purpose and of high quality, as referred to in the Interinstitutional Agreement
between the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission on Better Law-Making.
CONTENT: the proposal seeks to repeal Council Regulation (EEC) No 1101/89, Regulations (EC) No 2888/2000 and (EC) No 685/2001 of the
European Parliament and of the Council:
Council Regulation (EEC) No 1101/89 introduced arrangements for structural improvements in the inland waterway sector for the fleets
operating on the linked inland waterway networks of Belgium, Germany, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Austria. The objective of
that Regulation was to reduce overcapacity in the inland waterway fleets by means of vessel-scrapping schemes coordinated at Community
level. On 29 March 1999, Council Regulation (EC) No 718/1999 on a Community-fleet capacity policy to promote inland waterway transport
was adopted in order to ensure that the appropriate tools continued to be available to the inland waterway transport sector and to manage the
fleet capacity. This Regulation entered into force on 29 April 1999 to succeed to Regulation (EEC) No 1101/89;
Regulation (EC) No 2888/2000 concerns the distribution of quotas for heavy goods vehicles which the Community received from Switzerland
for years 2001 to 2004 among its Member States. In accordance with the Agreement between the European Community and Switzerland on
the Carriage of Goods and Passengers by Rail and Road and with effect from 1 January 2005, all vehicles meeting the technical standards of
Directive 96/53/EC (that is to say, up to a maximum weight of 40 tonnes) shall be exempt from any quota or authorisation arrangements.
Therefore, Regulation (EC) No 2888/2000 should be repealed;
Regulation (EC) No 685/2001 lays down the rules for the distribution between the Member States of authorisations available to the Community
by virtue of the agreements between the European Community and Bulgaria and between the European Community and Romania establishing
certain conditions for the carriage of goods by road and the promotion of combined transport. The Regulation has become obsolete as
Bulgaria and Romania have acceded to the Union and as Member States they are no longer subject to a system of authorisations as far as
access to the haulage market is concerned.

2016/0368(COD) - 21/06/2017 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Transport and Tourism adopted the report by Karima DELLI (Greens/EFA, FR) on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 1101/89, Regulations (EC) No 2888/2000 and (EC) No
685/2001.
The committee recommended that the European Parliaments position adopted at first reading, in accordance with the ordinary legislative
procedure, should support the repeal of Regulation (EEC) No 1101/89, Regulation (EC) No 2888/2000 and Regulation (EC) No 685/2001 as
proposed by the Commission.
Two amendments were introduced in two recitals. The first states that it is proposed to repeal legislative acts in both inland waterway and
haulage sectors.
Furthermore, since Regulation No 546/2014 introduced the subject-matter of repealed Regulation No 1101/89, the second amendment seeks
to mention in a recital Regulation No 546/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 718/1999 on a
Community-fleet capacity policy to promote inland waterway transport.

2016/0368(COD) - 12/09/2017 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 683 votes to 3 with 2 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 1101/89, Regulations (EC) No 2888/2000 and (EC) No
685/2001.
The European Parliaments position adopted at first reading in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure supports the Commissions
proposal to repeal obsolete regulations concerning the inland navigation and road haulage sectors.
The following should be repealed:
Regulation (EEC) No 1101/89 on structural improvements in inland waterway transport;
Regulation (EC) No 2888/2000 on the distribution of permits for heavy goods vehicles travelling in Switzerland;
Regulation (EC) No 685/2001 concerning the distribution of authorisations among Member States received through the Agreements
establishing certain conditions for the carriage of goods by road and the promotion of combined transport between the European
Community and the Republic of Bulgaria and between the European Community and Romania.
