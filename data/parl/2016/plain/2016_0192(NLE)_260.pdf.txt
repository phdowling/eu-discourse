2016/0192(NLE) - 23/06/2016 Initial legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude the Agreement between the European Union and Norway on reciprocal access to fishing in the Skagerrak for vessels
flying the flag of Denmark, Norway and Sweden.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: an Agreement on reciprocal access to fishing in the Skagerrak and Kattegat between Denmark, Norway and Sweden was
signed on 19 December 1966. It remained in force for an initial period of 35 years until 2002 and was subsequently extended for two five-year
periods until 2012.
This agreement allowed for reciprocal access between those three countries to fish up to 4 nautical miles from their respective baselines in the
Skagerrak and Kattegat, which are the waters between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. It established that, for the purposes of such fishing,
the area in question was deemed to constitute the high seas.
In view of more recent developments in international fisheries law, Norway considered that the existing agreement was not in conformity with
the current provisions of the Law of the Sea. Norway was particularly concerned with regard to the provisions on control.
On 29 July 2009, the Norwegian Foreign Ministry formally informed the Danish authorities that they wished to terminate the Agreement with a
formal denunciation. Consequently, the Agreement expired on 7 August 2012.
Subsequently, Norway entered into formal negotiations with the Commission, on behalf of the European Union, with the aim of establishing a
replacement Agreement on reciprocal access to fishing in the Skagerrak and Kattegat area. This new Agreement was signed on 15 January
2015.
CONTENT: the Commission proposed that the Council conclude the Agreement between the European Union and Norway on reciprocal

access to fishing in the Skagerrak for vessels flying the flag of Denmark, Norway and Sweden on behalf of the Union.
The new Agreement:
maintains the exclusive access granted to vessels from Denmark, Norway and Sweden to each other's waters outside 4 nautical miles
from the baselines;
ensures continued reciprocal access for the two Member States and Norway to the respective waters of the other Parties in the
Skagerrak area, whilst at the same time, ensuring sound conservation and management measures for fisheries in the area;
allows for control measures in harmony with the principles of normal Coastal State jurisdiction, as is already the case for fisheries in
the North Sea.
The measures proposed are designed in accordance with the objectives and the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy and are consistent with
the Union's policy on sustainable development.

2016/0192(NLE) - 12/07/2016 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: conclude the Agreement between the European Union and the Kingdom of Norway on reciprocal access to fishing in the
Skagerrak for vessels flying the flag of Denmark, Norway and Sweden.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: the Agreement between the European Union and the Kingdom of Norway on reciprocal access to fishing in the Skagerrak for
vessels flying the flag of Denmark, Norway and Sweden was signed on 15 January 2015, subject to its conclusion at a later date.
The Agreement should now be approved.
CONTENT: the draft Council Decision seeks to approve, on behalf of the Union, the Agreement between the European Union and Norway on
reciprocal access to fishing in the Skagerrak for vessels flying the flag of Denmark, Norway and Sweden.
The new Agreement:
maintains the exclusive access granted to vessels from Denmark, Norway and Sweden to each other's waters outside 4 nautical miles
from the baselines;
ensures continued reciprocal access for the two Member States and Norway to the respective waters of the other Parties in the
Skagerrak area, whilst at the same time, ensuring sound conservation and management measures for fisheries in the area;

the North Sea.

2016/0192(NLE) - 10/11/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Fisheries adopted the recommendation by Jørn DOHRMANN (ECR, DK) on the draft Council decision on the conclusion of
the Agreement between the European Union and the Kingdom of Norway on reciprocal access to fishing in the Skagerrak for vessels flying the
flag of Denmark, Norway and Sweden.
The committee called on the Parliament to give its consent to the conclusion of the Agreement.
In brief, an Agreement on reciprocal access to fishing in the Skagerrak and Kattegat between Denmark, Norway and Sweden of 1966 entered
into force on 7 August 1967. This Agreement, which was supplemented by the 1980 bilateral fisheries agreement between the European
Union and Norway, allowed for reciprocal access between the three countries to fish up to four nautical miles from their respective baselines in
the Skagerrak and Kattegat.
The 1966 agreement remained in force for an initial period of 35 years until 2002 and was subsequently extended for two five-year periods
until 2012.
Subsequently, Norway entered into formal negotiations with the Commission, on behalf of the European Union, with the aim of establishing a
replacement agreement on reciprocal access to fishing in the Skagerrak and Kattegat area. This new Agreement was initialled on 24 October
2013 and signed on 15 January 2015.
The new Agreement:
maintains the exclusive access granted to vessels from Denmark, Norway and Sweden to each other's waters outside four nautical
miles from the baselines;
ensures continued reciprocal access for the two Member States and Norway to the respective waters of the other Parties in the
Skagerrak and Kattegat area, whilst at the same time, ensuring sound conservation and management measures for fisheries in the
area;
allows for control measures in harmony with the principles of normal Coastal State jurisdiction, as is already the case for fisheries in
the North Sea.
In a short justification accompanying the draft resolution, it is recalled that traditionally, fishermen do not fish in certain waters: they fish certain
stocks or for certain species and fish in the waters where those stocks or species are found and follow migrating species. This tradition
predates the creation of states and the recognition of territorial waters and, much later, of exclusive economic zones. The Kattegat and
Skagerrak are typical examples of this.
The Agreement adds to the support of the historical fishing rights in this area and will also be beneficial for the implementation of the reformed
CFP in the Kattegat and Skagerrak.

2016/0192(NLE) - 14/12/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 638 votes to 10, with 46 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the draft Council decision on the
conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and the Kingdom of Norway on reciprocal access to fishing in the Skagerrak for
vessels flying the flag of Denmark, Norway and Sweden.
In line with its Committee on Fisheries, Parliament gave its consent to the conclusion of the Agreement.
As a reminder, an Agreement on reciprocal access to fishing in the Skagerrak and Kattegat between Denmark, Norway and Sweden of 1966
entered into force on 7 August 1967.
A replacement agreement on reciprocal access to fishing in the Skagerrak and Kattegat area was initialled on 24 October 2013 and signed on
15 January 2015.
The new Agreement maintains continued reciprocal access for the two Member States and Norway to the respective waters of the other
Parties in the Skagerrak and Kattegat area, whilst at the same time, ensuring sound conservation and management measures for fisheries in
the area.

2016/0192(NLE) - 19/12/2016 Final act
PURPOSE: to conclude the Agreement between the European Union and Norway on reciprocal access to fishing in the Skagerrak for vessels
flying the flag of Denmark, Norway and Sweden.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Council Decision (EU) 2017/3 on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and the Kingdom of
Norway on reciprocal access to fishing in the Skagerrak for vessels flying the flag of Denmark, Norway and Sweden.
CONTENT: under this Decision, the Agreement between the European Union and Norway on reciprocal access to fishing in the Skagerrak for
vessels flying the flag of Denmark, Norway and Sweden is approved on behalf of the Union. The Agreement was signed on 15 January 2015,
subject to its conclusion at a later date.
This Agreement applies to an area in the Skagerrak bounded on the west by a straight line running through the Hanstholm lighthouse and the
Lindesnes lighthouse and on the south by a straight line running through the Skagen lighthouse and the Tistlarna lighthouse, within those parts
of the territorial sea and adjacent areas of fisheries jurisdiction of Denmark, Norway and Sweden, that extend beyond four nautical miles (1
nautical mile = 1 852 metres) from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured.
The new Agreement:
maintains the exclusive access granted to vessels from Denmark, Norway and Sweden to each other's waters outside 4 nautical miles
from the baselines;
ensures continued reciprocal access for the two Member States and Norway to the respective waters of the other Parties in the
Skagerrak area, whilst at the same time, ensuring sound conservation and management measures for fisheries in the area;

of termination given at least one year before the expiry of that period, it shall remain in force for additional periods of six years duration
thereafter, provided that notice of termination has not been given at least one year before the expiry of any such six years period.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 19.12.2016.
