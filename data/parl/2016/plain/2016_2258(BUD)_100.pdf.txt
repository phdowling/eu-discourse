2016/2258(BUD) - 07/10/2016 Commission draft budget
PURPOSE: presentation of Draft Amending Budget No 5 to the Budget for 2016 in order to take account of the entry into force of the new Own
Resources Decision No 2014/335/EU.
CONTENT: this Draft Amending Budget No 5 to the Budget for 2016 (DAB 5/2016) covers the implementation of the new Own Resources
Decision No 2014/335/EU, Euratom (hereafter, ORD 2014), following the completion of the ratification process and the entry into force of ORD
2014 on 1 October 2016.
DAB 5/2016 takes into account the retroactive effect of ORD 2014 from 1 January 2014 onwards and therefore includes the adjustments for
the financial years 2014, 2015 and 2016 related to the new provisions introduced by ORD 2014.
The retroactive impact is calculated by comparing the amounts that Member States should have made available for the year 2014 according to
the ORD 2014 and the amounts that have already been made available for that year based on the Own Resources Decision No 2007/436/EC,
Euratom. Therefore, the calculation of the retroactive effect is based on the latest available real data for each type of own resource.
The retroactive impact is calculated using the same methodology as for 2014.
Lastly, this DAB incorporates some technical amendments related to the adoption of ORD 2014 to reflect the adjustments proposed in the
2016 budget structure. The total of these changes mean that the amount of own resources of the Union after the draft amending budget
amounts to EUR 133 645 177 297.

2016/2258(BUD) - 08/11/2016 Council position on draft budget

On 7 October 2016, the Commission submitted to the Council draft amending budget (DAB) No 5/2016.
The aim of this DAB is to implement the new Own Resources Decision 2014/335/EU, Euratom (ORD 2014) following the completion of the
ratification process and the entry into force of this Decision on 1 October 2016.
DAB No 5/2016 takes into account the retroactive effect of the ORD 2014 from 1 January 2014 onwards and includes the necessary
adjustments to the amounts made available by Member States in the years 2014, 2015 and 2016.
The global impact of this DAB on the 2016 budget is a result of new elements included in the ORD 2014 that were not part of the "old" Own
Resources Decision of 2007.
These are:
a new rate of collection costs for traditional own resources,
a reduced VAT call rate for Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden,
the use of ESA 2010 data for GNI,
a gross reduction in the annual GNI-based contributions for Denmark, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden.
The financing of the 2014 and 2015 UK correction had to be adjusted accordingly.
The net impact of this DAB is zero, notably as additional corrections granted to some Member States in the ORD 2014 have to be financed by
the others.
On 8 November 2016, the Council adopted its position on DAB No 5 to the general budget for 2016 as set out in the annex to its position (see
the technical annex of Council doc.13584/2016).

2016/2258(BUD) - 25/11/2016 Budgetary report tabled for plenary, 1st reading
The Committee on Budgets adopted the report by José Manuel FERNANDES (EPP, PT) on the Council position on draft amending budget No
5/2016 of the European Union for the financial year 2016: Implementation of the Own Resources Decision No 2014/335/EU further to the
closing of the ratification process and its entry into force on 1 October 2016.
As a reminder, draft amending budget (DAB) No 5/2016 results from the completion of the ratification process and the entry into force of the
Decision No 2014/335/EU, Euratom on the system of own resources of the European Union, which contains:
limited changes such as the reduction of the collection costs of Traditional Own Resources,
a new reduced rate of call of the VAT-based resource for some Member States,
gross reductions in GNI-based contributions for some Member States.
Draft amending budget No 5/2016 aims at incorporating in the revenue side of the 2016 Union budget the impact of adjustments to the own
resources stemming from the implementation of Decision N0 2014/335/EU, Euratom, with retroactive effect for the financial years 2014, 2015
and 2016.
This DAB leads, therefore, to the modification of the individual contributions of all Member States, but affects neither the overall revenue nor
expenditure side of the Union budget.
Members called on the European Parliament to approve the Council position on Draft amending budget No 5/2016.

2016/2258(BUD) - 01/12/2016 Budgetary text adopted by Parliament
The European Parliament adopted by 530 votes to 83, with 29 abstentions, a resolution on the Council position on draft amending budget No
5/2016 of the European Union for the financial year 2016: Implementation of the Own Resources Decision No 2014/335/EU further to the
closing of the ratification process and its entry into force on 1 October 2016.
Parliament recalled that draft amending budget (DAB) No 5/2016 results from the completion of the ratification process and the entry into force
of the Decision No 2014/335/EU, Euratom on the system of own resources of the European Union, which contains:
limited changes such as the reduction of the collection costs of Traditional Own Resources,
a new reduced rate of call of the VAT-based resource for some Member States,
gross reductions in GNI-based contributions for some Member States.
Draft amending budget No 5/2016 aims at incorporating in the revenue side of the 2016 Union budget the impact of adjustments to the own
resources stemming from the implementation of Decision N0 2014/335/EU, Euratom, with retroactive effect for the financial years 2014, 2015
and 2016.
This DAB leads, therefore, to the modification of the individual contributions of all Member States, but affects neither the overall revenue nor
expenditure side of the Union budget.
In parallel, Parliament approved, unamended, the Council position on Draft amending budget No 5/2016.
