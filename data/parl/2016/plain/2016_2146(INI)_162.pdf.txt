2016/2146(INI) - 02/12/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Petitions adopted the own-initiative report by Ángela VALLINA (GUE/NGL, ES) on the activities of the Committee on
Petitions 2015.
It began by recalling that the purpose of the annual report on the activities of the Committee on Petitions is to present an analysis of the
petitions received in 2015 and of relations with other institutions.
In terms of statistics, the report noted that 1 431 petitions were received in 2015, 47% down on the figure for 2014; 943 petitions were
considered admissible, of which 424 were quickly examined and concluded after duly informing petitioners on their respective issues of
concern. 519 petitions remain open for discussion in the Committee on Petitions. 483 petitions (around 34%) were declared inadmissible, with
Members noting that there is still widespread confusion about the EUs fields of activity as is shown by this high number.
With regard to main areas of policy, the key issues of concern raised in petitions pertain to a wide range of issues, such as environmental
protection, breaches of consumer rights, the application of justice (in particular, custody rights regarding minors), fundamental rights, free
movement of persons, discrimination, immigration, employment and animal welfare. The committee noted the following:
Mortgage legislation and risky financial instruments: Members drew attention to Parliaments resolution of 8 October 2015 on this issue
in Spain, in the light of the petitions received, concerning which Parliament issued a series of recommendations for the proper
application of EU mortgage legislation and combating banking abuses. Members called on the Commission to supervise closely the
implementation in all Member States of Directive 2014/17/EU on credit agreements and Directive 93/13/EEC on unfair terms in
consumer contracts, and to share best practice in order to improve protection of citizens in financial difficulties.
Persons with disabilities: in January 2015 two Members were appointed as representative members of the Committee on Petitions in
the structures of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CPRD) and they took part in the analysis of
the preliminary report of the European Union and the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in Geneva in
August 2015. The report stressed that the Commission has begun to incorporate the concluding observations by the UNCRPD into the
petition treatment process.
Work of the Committee on Petitions: the report stated that confidence in the system and in the European project as a whole has been dented
by recent events in the United Kingdom, the humanitarian refugee crisis, the social and economic impact of austerity measures, the inability to
resolve the financial crisis in a way that guarantees all citizens a free and dignified life, and the rise in xenophobia and racism throughout
Europe. The Committee on Petitions has the responsibility and the huge challenge of strengthening constructive dialogue with EU citizens and
residents on European issues.
Members believed that petitions could help to better assess the impact that EU legislation has on peoples daily lives by acting as a bridge
between citizens and the institutions. Since the committee aims to engage in a trustworthy and fruitful dialogue with citizens, it should help to
promote participatory democracy and provide an adequate response to petitions, in terms of both the timing and the quality of the answer.
Members stressed that petitions are also important for the legislative process, as they detect existing loopholes and deficiencies in the
transposition of Community legislation. They applauded the intention to establish an informal petitions network within Parliament, with the
participation of Members representing every Parliament committee.
Cooperation with national parliaments: the report considered it essential to improve cooperation with national parliaments and their relevant

committees and with Member State governments. Members repeated their call for a structured dialogue to be launched with Member States in
the form of regular meetings with the relevant national parliament committees.
Charter of Fundamental Rights: Members deplored the strict and restrictive way in which the Commission has interpreted Article 51 of the
Charter of Fundamental Rights, which states, inter alia, that the Charter is addressed to the Member States only when they are implementing
Union law. They recalled that, owing to the existence of Article 51 of the Charter, the expectations of citizens often go beyond what the
Charters legal provisions strictly allow for and are often unmet, and the Commission was asked to adopt a new approach that is more
consistent with those expectations.

2016/2146(INI) - 15/12/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 441 votes to 97 with 8 abstentions a resolution on the activities of the Committee on Petitions 2015.
It began by recalling that the purpose of the annual report on the activities of the Committee on Petitions is to present an analysis of the
petitions received in 2015 and of relations with other institutions.
In terms of statistics, Parliament noted that 1 431 petitions were received in 2015, 47% down on the figure for 2014; 943 petitions were
considered admissible, of which 424 were quickly examined and concluded after duly informing petitioners on their respective issues of
concern. 519 petitions remain open for discussion in the Committee on Petitions. 483 petitions (around 34%) were declared inadmissible, with
Members noting that there is still widespread confusion about the EUs fields of activity as is shown by this high number. The number of
petitions received is modest when compared to the EUs total population, which indicates that the vast majority of EU citizens and residents are
unfortunately not yet aware of the right to petition, or of its possible usefulness as a means of drawing the attention of the EU institutions and
Member States to matters which affect and concern them, and come within the Unions field of activity.
With regard to main areas of policy, the key issues of concern raised in petitions pertain to a wide range of issues, such as environmental
protection, breaches of consumer rights, the application of justice (in particular, custody rights regarding minors), fundamental rights, free
movement of persons, discrimination, immigration, employment and animal welfare. Parliament noted the following:
Mortgage legislation and risky financial instruments: Members drew attention to Parliaments resolution of 8 October 2015 on this issue
in Spain, in the light of the petitions received, concerning which Parliament issued a series of recommendations for the proper
application of EU mortgage legislation and combating banking abuses. Members called on the Commission to supervise closely the
implementation in all Member States of Directive 2014/17/EU on credit agreements and Directive 93/13/EEC on unfair terms in
consumer contracts, and to share best practice in order to improve protection of citizens in financial difficulties.
Persons with disabilities: in January 2015 two Members were appointed as representative members of the Committee on Petitions in
the structures of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CPRD) and they took part in the analysis of
the preliminary report of the European Union and the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in Geneva in
August 2015. Parliament stressed that the Commission has begun to incorporate the concluding observations by the UNCRPD into
the petition treatment process.
Environmental protection: Parliament considered that in its role as guardian of the treaties, particularly when it comes to environmental
matters, the Commission should go beyond a mere formal examination of procedural compliance and focus more on the actual content of the
core issue. Members urged the Commission to adopt an approach that allows it to make use of its powers and prerogatives on an ex-ante
basis, with respect to preventing irreversible damage to ecologically sensitive areas.
Work of the Committee on Petitions: Parliament stated that confidence in the system and in the European project as a whole has been dented
by recent events in the United Kingdom, the humanitarian refugee crisis, the social and economic impact of austerity measures, the inability to
resolve the financial crisis in a way that guarantees all citizens a free and dignified life, and the rise in xenophobia and racism throughout
Europe. The Committee on Petitions has the responsibility and the huge challenge of strengthening constructive dialogue with EU citizens and
residents on European issues.

Members stressed that petitions are also important for the legislative process, as they detect existing loopholes and deficiencies in the
transposition of Community legislation. They applauded the intention to establish an informal petitions network within Parliament, with the
participation of Members representing every Parliament committee.
Work of the Commission: Parliament welcomed the fact that the Commission is committed to the petition process and that it responds as
quickly as possible to new petitions forwarded to it by Parliament. It recalled, however, that on many occasions the Commission does not
provide any new information in its replies to petitions for which a review has been requested owing to a change in their status and context.
Members regretted the occasions when the Commission focuses essentially on procedural aspects and does not enter into the substance of
the issue.
They added that, where required, the Commission should provide Parliament with a synthesis of the individual cases related to EU Pilot
procedures, and reiterated that Committee on Petitions must be informed by the Commission of developments in infringement proceedings
directly linked to petitions.
Cooperation with national parliaments: Parliament considered it essential to improve cooperation with national parliaments and their relevant
committees and with Member State governments. It repeated its call for a structured dialogue to be launched with Member States in the form
of regular meetings with the relevant national parliament committees.
Charter of Fundamental Rights: Members deplored the strict and restrictive way in which the Commission has interpreted Article 51 of the
Charter of Fundamental Rights, which states, inter alia, that the Charter is addressed to the Member States only when they are implementing
Union law. They recalled that, owing to the existence of Article 51 of the Charter, the expectations of citizens often go beyond what the
Charters legal provisions strictly allow for and are often unmet, and urged a broader interpretation of the scope of application of the Charter,
and for the pertinence of this article to be ultimately reassessed in future revisions of the Charter and the treaties.

Lastly, the resolution noted that the web portal of the Committee on Petitions, which began to operate in late 2014, is up and running, but not
yet finalised.
