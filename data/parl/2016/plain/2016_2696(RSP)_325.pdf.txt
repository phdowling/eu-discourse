Summary

2016/2696(RSP) - 12/05/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a resolution on the follow-up to and review of the 2030 Agenda.
The resolution was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ECR, ALDE, GUE/NGL and EFDD groups. Members recalled that the UN Secretary-General of

the UN has been mandated to produce an annual Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) progress report in order to provide support for the
follow-up and review at the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). The SDG progress report is to be based on data
produced by national statistical systems and information collected at different levels. The HLPF meeting in July 2016 will include voluntary
reviews of 22 countries including four European countries Estonia, Finland, France and Germany and thematic reviews of progress on the
Sustainable Development Goals, including cross-cutting issues.
Parliament asked the Foreign Affairs Council in its development component to adopt, ahead of the HLPFs July 2016 meeting, a coherent and
common EU position, taking into account Parliaments position. It welcomed the report of the Inter-Agency and Expert Group on the SDG
indicators published on 17 December 2015, believing that it represents a remarkable achievement and a good basis for negotiations.
Parliament stressed that the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs represent a renewed international commitment to eradicating poverty, to redefining
and modernising EU development strategies for the next 15 years in order to deliver results. It called on the Commission to:
come forward with a proposal for an overarching sustainable development strategy encompassing all relevant internal and external
policy areas, with: (i) a detailed timeline up to 2030, (ii) a mid-term review and a specific procedure ensuring Parliaments full
involvement, (iii) a concrete implementation plan coordinating the achievement of the 17 goals, 169 targets and 230 global indicators.
The new strategy should ensure consistency with the Paris Agreement goals and be subject to a broad consultation with all
stakeholders;
present a communication on the follow-up to and review of the 2030 Agenda, with clear information on the implementation structure of
the Agenda at EU and Member State level; all relevant Commission Directorates-General and the European External Action Service
(EEAS) should be fully engaged in the integration of the 2030 Agenda in the forthcoming review of the Europe 2020 strategy and the
forthcoming EU Global Strategy on Foreign and Security Policy;
develop effective monitoring, review and accountability mechanisms for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, and to report back to
Parliament on a regular basis; recalls, in this connection, the need to increase democratic scrutiny by Parliament, possibly through a
binding interinstitutional agreement, under Article 295 of the TFEU;
with the UN specialised agencies, funds and programmes, establish a high-level dialogue on the implementation of the SDGs, with a
view to coordinating the policies, programmes and operations of the EU, the UN and other donors;
Parliament stressed that the EU must take full advantage of the upcoming mid-term review of the multiannual financial framework (MFF) in
order to ensure that funding mechanisms and budgetary lines reflect all 2030 Agenda commitments agreed to by the EU. It called for the EU
and its Member States to recommit without delay to the 0.7 % of GNI target for ODA and to submit a timeline on how to gradually increase
ODA in order to reach that.
Lastly, Members invited the Commission and the EEAS, in close consultation with other partners, to present concrete proposals on how to
more effectively integrate policy coherence for development into the EU approach to implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development.
