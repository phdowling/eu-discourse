2016/2269(INI) - 31/10/2017 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs adopted the own-initiative report by Javi LÓPEZ (S&D, ES) on combating inequalities as a
lever to boost job creation and growth.
Equality and fairness are a cornerstone for the European social model, the EU and its Member States. The objectives of both the Member
States and the EU include the promotion of employment, with a view to lasting high employment and combating exclusion.
Inequality and unemployment curtail effective demand, frustrate innovation, and can lead to increased financial fragility. Combating inequalities
can be a lever to boost job creation and growth and at the same time reduce poverty.
European policy coordination to combat inequality: Members affirmed that inequalities threaten the future of the European project. They
emphasised the reduction of inequalities must be one of the main priorities at the European level, not only in order to tackle poverty or promote
convergence, but also as the precondition for economic recovery, decent job creation, social cohesion and shared prosperity.
The Commission and the Member States are asked to evaluate the performance and outcomes of economic policy coordination , taking into
account the evolution of social progress and social justice in the EU. Members observed that the European Semester has not prioritised the
achievement of these aims and the reduction of inequalities.
Against this background, Members urged the Commission to:
improve the process of policy coordination in order to better monitor, prevent and correct negative trends that could increase
inequalities and weaken social progress;
present to Parliament and to the Council by mid-2018 an analysis and comparison of the impact and results achieved by the country
specific recommendations and the measures taken within the scope of the European Semester and under different EU programmes
for overcoming the inequalities resulting from the economic crisis;
outline further policy recommendations for combating inequalities;
establish an accurate and up-to- date picture of the differences in income and wealth, social cohesion and social inclusion between
and within countries,
promote ambitious investment in social protection, services and infrastructures by Member States through a more targeted and
strategic use of the European Structural and Investment Funds and the European Fund for Strategic Investments, in order to respond
to the social and economic needs of Member States and regions;
put forward a concrete 'Roadmap completing the Social Dimension of the EMU';

work with Member States to develop comprehensive strategies for job creation, entrepreneurship and innovation, aiming for strategic
investment in green jobs, in the social, health and care sectors, and in the social economy, whose employment potential is untapped;
propose a higher funding level for the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) for the period 2017-2020, to at least EUR 21 billion, including
better reaching young people under 30;
contribute to better implementation of the Youth Guarantee.
Improving working and living conditions: the Commission and the Member States are called on to improve working and living conditions and to
step up their efforts to fight the shadow economy and undeclared work. Members urged them to explore the possibility of establishing a
European unemployment insurance scheme, complementing current national unemployment benefit systems and to promote fairer wage
scales.
Strengthening the welfare state and social protection: the report encouraged the Member States to improve their welfare systems (education,
health, housing, pensions and transfers) on a basis of high-level social safeguards, in order to achieve comprehensive protection of people,
taking into account the new social risks and vulnerable groups that have appeared as a result of the financial, economic and then social crises
with which the Member States have had to cope. Investment in quality and affordable early childhood education and care services should be
strengthened as this is key for combating inequalities in the long term.
Members called for:
a European framework in line with the related ILO recommendation, outlining a social protection floor guaranteeing universal access to
healthcare, basic income security, access and support for education;
universal access to affordable housing, protecting vulnerable households against eviction and over-indebtedness;
swift action on the current migration and refugee crisis and guarantee that refugees have access to rapid language and culture
learning processes, training, quality housing, healthcare, education, labour market and social protection and recognition of formal and
non-formal skills and capabilities, and to ensure their inclusion in society;
support in strengthening public and occupational pension systems to provide an adequate retirement income above the poverty
threshold;
care credits in pension systems to compensate for lost contributions of women and men due to childcare and long-term care
responsibilities, as a tool to reduce the gender pension gap;
the swift adoption of the directive on gender balance among non-executive directors of listed companies, as an important first step
towards equal representation in both public and private sectors.
Lastly, as regards the modernisation of tax systems, objective taxation policies are crucial and that many Member States need a deep tax
reform. Real actions against tax avoidance and tax fraud are needed, as an important means of reducing economic inequalities and improving
the collection of tax revenues in Member States.
Reforms should also tackle corruption in public administration and tackle wealth inequality, including by redistributing the excessive
concentration of wealth. Further coordination, approximation and harmonisation of tax policy, as well as measures against tax havens, tax
fraud and evasion are called for.

2016/2269(INI) - 16/11/2017 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 386 votes to 102, with 51 abstentions, a resolution on combating inequalities as a lever to boost job
creation and growth.
Equality and fairness are an integral part of European values and a cornerstone for the European social model. Combating inequalities can be
a lever to boost job creation and growth and at the same time reduce poverty (47.5 % of all unemployed persons in the EU were at risk of
poverty in 2015).
European policy coordination to combat inequality: Parliament affirmed that inequalities threaten the future of the European project. It
emphasised the reduction of inequalities must be one of the main priorities at the European level, not only in order to tackle poverty or promote
convergence, but also as the precondition for economic recovery, decent job creation, social cohesion and shared prosperity.
The European Semester has not prioritised the achievement of these aims and the reduction of inequalities. Therefore, it urged the
Commission to:
improve the process of policy coordination in order to better monitor, prevent and correct negative trends that could increase
inequalities and weaken social progress;
within the scope of the European Semester, better assess imbalances in terms of income and wealth distribution, and to justify its
proposals and recommendations for political decisions with solid and detailed data;
promote ambitious investment in social protection, services and infrastructures by Member States through a more targeted and
strategic use of the European Structural and Investment Funds and the European Fund for Strategic Investments, in order to respond
to the social and economic needs of Member States and regions;
continue, with the Member States, efforts to reduce inequalities between income groups and promote measures to ensure, inter alia,
decent working conditions for all, public education and health, pensions, adequate public infrastructure and social services;
work with Member States to develop comprehensive strategies for job creation, entrepreneurship and innovation, aiming for strategic
investment in green jobs, in the social, health and care sectors, and in the social economy, whose employment potential is untapped;
propose an upward revision of the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) budget for the period 2017-2020, including better reaching young
people under 30 and facilitate the implementation of the Youth Guarantee.
Parliament reiterated its call for the establishment of an authentic European Pillar of Social Rights which promotes upwards convergence,
taking into consideration the share of competences laid down in the Treaties and the building of a deeper and fairer social dimension of the
EMU.
Improving working and living conditions: given that undeclared work, atypical work contracts and other forms of non-standard employment may
give rise to lower wages, Parliament urged the need for adequate social security and social protection to be provided to protect all workers and

for increased efforts to fight the shadow economy and undeclared work.
Members called for an accurate common employment classification in order to reduce precariousness. Moreover, the new skills strategy must
provide affordable access for all workers to lifelong learning and ensure adaptation to digitalisation and permanent technological change.
The resolution stressed the importance of social dialogue and collective bargaining for determining wages. It called on the Commission to
improve the health and safety of workers at work and called for the implementation of a strong anti-discrimination policy.
Strengthening the welfare state and social protection: Parliament encouraged the Member States to improve their welfare systems (education,
health, housing, pensions and transfers) on a basis of high-level social safeguards, in order to achieve comprehensive protection of people,
taking into account the new social risks and vulnerable groups that have appeared as a result of the financial crisis. Investment in quality and
affordable early childhood education and care services should be strengthened as this is key for combating inequalities in the long term.
Members called for:
universal access to affordable housing, protecting vulnerable households against eviction and over-indebtedness;
swift action on the current migration and refugee crisis and guarantee that refugees have access to rapid language and culture
learning processes, training, quality housing, healthcare, education, labour market and social protection and recognition of formal and
non-formal skills and capabilities, and to ensure their inclusion in society;
support in strengthening public and occupational pension systems to provide an adequate retirement income above the poverty
threshold;
care credits in pension systems to compensate for lost contributions of women and men due to childcare and long-term care
responsibilities;
the right to decent and barrier-free work for people with disabilities;
fairer international trade agreements that respect European labour market regulations and ILO core conventions, while also protecting
quality employment and workers rights;
active labour market policies, based on gender mainstreaming aimed at increasing women's participation in the labour market.
Modernising taxation: Members insisted that many Member States need a deep tax reform. Real actions against tax avoidance and fraud
would be an important means of reducing economic inequalities and improving the collection of tax revenues in the Member States.
Reforms should also tackle corruption in public administration and address wealth inequality, including by redistributing the excessive
concentration of wealth, since this is vital if inequality is not to be exacerbated in many Member States.
