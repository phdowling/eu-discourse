2016/0279(COD) - 14/09/2016 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to implement the Unions obligations under the Marrakesh Treaty in respect of the exchange of accessible format copies between
the Union and third countries that are parties to the Marrakesh Treaty, for the benefit of persons who are blind, visually impaired or otherwise
print disabled.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with Council.
BACKGROUND: persons who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled face many barriers to accessing books and other print
material protected by copyright and related rights. The availability of books in formats that are accessible to print-disabled persons is estimated
to be between 7 % and 20% despite the fact that digital technology greatly facilitates accessible publishing. Accessible formats include e.g.
Braille, large print, e-books and audiobooks with special navigation, audio description and radio broadcasts.
The need to increase the number of works and other protected subject-matter in accessible formats available to those persons and improve
their circulation and dissemination has been recognised at an international level.
The Marrakesh Treaty was adopted in 2013 at the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) with the aim of facilitating the availability
and cross-border exchange of books and other print material in accessible formats around the world. It was signed by the Union in April 2014.
The Treaty requires the parties to provide exceptions or limitations to copyright and related rights and allows for the cross-border exchange of
special format copies of books, including audio books, and other print material between countries that are parties to the Treaty.
In order to implement the Marrakesh Treaty within the Union, a parallel proposal requires Member States to introduce a mandatory exception
to certain rights of right holders harmonised by Union law for the benefit of beneficiary persons and to ensure cross-border access to special
format copies within the internal market.
Together with the draft directive mentioned above, the proposed regulation will allow the Union to fulfil an international obligation under the
Marrakesh Treaty to facilitate access to published works for Persons who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled.
CONTENT: the proposed regulation aims to implement the obligations in the Marrakesh Treaty with respect to the export and import of
accessible format copies for the benefit of beneficiary persons between the Union and third countries that are parties to the Marrakesh Treaty,
and to lay down the conditions for such export and import.
The proposed regulation:
contains provisions on the export of accessible format copies from the Union to third countries;
contains provisions on the import of accessible format copies from third countries to the Union;
serves to specify the obligations that authorised entities are required to fulfil when exchanging accessible format copies with third
countries;
sets out the applicable rules for the protection of personal data;
sets out the arrangements on the evaluation of the regulation, in accordance with better regulation rules.

The proposed regulation supports the right of persons with disabilities to benefit from measures designed to ensure their independence, social
and occupational integration and participation in the life of the community, as enshrined in Article 26 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of
the European Union. It also reflects the Union's commitments under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

2016/0279(COD) - 29/03/2017 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Legal Affairs adopted the report by Max ANDERSSON (Greens/EFA, SE) on the proposal for a regulation of the European
Parliament and of the Council on the cross-border exchange between the Union and third countries of accessible format copies of certain
works and other subject-matter protected by copyright and related rights for the benefit of persons who are blind, visually impaired or otherwise
print disabled.
The committee recommended that the European Parliaments position, adopted at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure,
should amend the Commission proposal as follows:
Subject matter: Members stipulated that the Regulation should aim to effectively ensure the right of persons who are blind, visually impaired or
otherwise print disabled to participate in cultural, economic and social life on an equal basis with others.
They introduced a reference to Article 26 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the United Nations Convention on
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
E-books should be included in the definition of protected works.
Definitions: Members proposed to harmonise the definition of beneficiary person with the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published
Works for Persons Who Are Blind, Visually Impaired, or Otherwise Print Disabled. They also supplemented the definition of authorised entity
proposed by the Commission. It shall mean an organisation authorised or recognised by the Member States in which it is established.
Complaints mechanism: an amendment called on Member States to put in place complaints or redress mechanisms in cases where
beneficiaries are denied the permitted uses.
Obligations of authorised entities: they shall: (i) respect the privacy of beneficiary persons; (ii) publish and update, on its website if appropriate,
or through other online or offline channels, information on the manner in which it complies with the obligations laid down in this Regulation; (iii)
provide information in an accessible way, on request, to any beneficiary person or right holder.
Exchanges of information: Member States shall foster the exchange of information and best practices amongst authorised entities so as to
effectively promote access to adapted works or subject-matter.
They shall facilitate the agreement of best practice guidelines between representative groups of authorised entities that engage in the
production, distribution or making available of accessible format copies, and users and right holders.
Members suggested the creation of a single online database in the Union in order to foster the export of accessible format copies and born
accessible publications.
Strategic plan: lastly, the European Commission shall present, within one year, a strategic action plan to promote the objectives of the
Marrakesh Treaty with special emphasis on ensuring widespread cross-border exchange with third countries, providing educational and
cultural works for visually impaired persons.

2016/0279(COD) - 06/07/2017 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 610 votes to 21, with 1 abstention, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council on the cross-border exchange between the Union and third countries of accessible format copies of
certain works and other subject-matter protected by copyright and related rights for the benefit of persons who are blind, visually impaired or
otherwise print disabled.
The position of the European Parliament adopted at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure amended the Commission
proposal as follows:

Union and third countries which are parties to the Marrakesh Treaty without the consent of the rights holders being obtained to the benefit of
the blind, the visually impaired and those with other difficulties reading printed texts.
The Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons who are Blind, Visually Impaired or Otherwise Print Disabled was
signed on behalf of the Union on 30 April 2014. This Treaty requires the Contracting Parties to provide for exceptions or limitations to copyright
and neighbouring rights for the production and distribution of accessible copies of certain works and other protected subject-matter and for the
cross-border exchange of such copies.
More specifically, the regulation should ensure that accessible copies of books, including e-books, magazines, newspapers, magazines and
other writings, notations, including sheet music, and related illustrations, in any media, including in audio for such as audiobooks and in digital
format, which have been made in any Member State can be distributed, communicated or made available to a blind person or an 'authorised
entity' (e.g. a public institution or a non-profit organisation) in third countries which are parties to the Marrakesh Treaty.
Accessible formats would include, for example, Braille, large print, e-books, adapted e-books, audiobooks and radio broadcasts.
Obligations applicable to authorised entities: the latter should (i) take measures to prevent the reproduction, distribution or making available to
the unauthorised public of copies in accessible format; (ii) publish and update, on their websites where appropriate, or through various other
online or offline channels, information on how they comply with the obligations set out in the Regulation.
The amended text stresses that, under the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, all forms of discrimination, including those based on disability,
are prohibited and the Union recognizes and respects the right of persons with disabilities to Measures to ensure their autonomy, social and

occupational integration and participation in the life of the community.
