years respectively from the date of their provisional application, i.e. from the date of their signature.

economic, financial, technical and scientific cooperation in the fisheries sector with a view to promoting responsible fishing in the Cook
Islands' fishery waters;

The main objective of the new Protocol is to provide fishing opportunities to Union vessels in the Cook Islands fishing zone, on the basis of the
best available scientific advice and respecting the conservation and management measures of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries
Commission (WCPFC) where applicable within the limits of the available surplus.
The aim is also to enhance cooperation between the European Union and the Cook Islands to promote a sustainable fisheries policy and
sound exploitation of fisheries resources in the Cook Islands? fishing zone, in the interests of both parties.
The Protocol provides for fishing opportunities for 4 tuna seiners to fish for highly migratory species as listed in Annex 1 of the 1982 United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.
The Agreement and the Implementation Protocol thereto also provide for the possibility of their suspension or termination in the event of a
breach by either one of the Parties of the respect for human rights.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the total financial contribution shall be EUR 2 870 000 for the whole duration of this Protocol. This total

2016/0077(NLE) - 30/01/2017 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Fisheries adopted the recommendation by João FERREIRA (GUE/NGL, PT) on the draft Council decision on the
conclusion on behalf of the European Union of a Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the
Government of the Cook Islands and the Implementation Protocol thereto.
The committee recommended the European Parliament to give its consent to the conclusion of the Agreement.
Members recalled that the Cook Islands have traditionally allowed vessels from other countries to have access to their exclusive economic
zone (EEZ). These Islands, which border Kiribati, Tokelau, French Polynesia, American Samoa, Niue, and high sea areas, extend over 1.98
million km2. This adds to the economic potential of the fisheries sector, but also entails problems as regards monitoring and control, since
illegal, unregulated, and unreported fishing is difficult to tackle over so vast an area in which resources are scattered so widely.
At present there are no EU vessels fishing in Cook Islands waters. Concluding a Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement is a strategic
choice for the EU and the Cook Islands that will provide fishing opportunities for vessels flying the flags of Member States, theoretically on the
basis of the best scientific advice available, subject to compliance with the conservation and management measures laid down by the Western

and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) within the limits of the available surplus.
Therefore, Members recommended that the European Parliament approve the conclusion of the Protocol, given its importance both to the
Cook Islands and to the EU fleets operating in their waters. They also stressed that the Agreement and its future prospects need to be
assessed and studied in more detail and that Parliament must, at every stage, be kept fully informed without delay about procedures related to
the Protocol or its renewal.

2016/0077(NLE) - 14/02/2017 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 578 votes to 95, with 16 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the draft Council decision on the
conclusion on behalf of the European Union of a Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the
Government of the Cook Islands and the Implementation Protocol thereto.
Parliament gave its consent to the conclusion of the Agreement.
It was recalled that, at present, there are no EU vessels fishing in Cook Islands waters. Concluding a Sustainable Fisheries Partnership
Agreement is a strategic choice for the EU and the Cook Islands that will provide fishing opportunities for vessels flying the flags of Member
States, theoretically on the basis of the best scientific advice available, subject to compliance with the conservation and management
measures laid down by the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) within the limits of the available surplus.
Therefore, Parliament considered that the Agreement and its Protocol should be adopted given their importance both to the Cook Islands and
to the EU fleets operating in their waters. It also stressed that it should be kept fully informed, at every stage, without delay about procedures
related to the Protocol or its renewal.
