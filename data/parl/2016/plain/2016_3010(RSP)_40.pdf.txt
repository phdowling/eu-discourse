Summary

2016/3010(RSP) - 15/12/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 463 votes to 168, with 3 abstentions, a resolution on the draft Commission implementing directive
amending Annexes I to V to Council Directive 2000/29/EC on protective measures against the introduction into the Community of organisms

harmful to plants or plant products and against their spread within the Community.
Members stated that the draft Commission implementing directive runs counter to the objectives of Regulation (EU) 2016/2031, in that it
undermines the requirements for the introduction into the Union of certain fruits susceptible to pests, in particular regarding citrus black spot
and citrus canker.
The objective of Regulation (EU) 2016/2031 is to determine the phytosanitary risks posed by any species, strain or biotype of pathogenic
agents, animals or parasitic plants injurious to plants or plant products (pests) and measures to reduce those risks to an acceptable level.
Regulation (EU) 2016/2031, as soon as it becomes applicable (i.e. on 14 December 2019), will repeal and replace Directive 2000/29/EC.
The Commission is called upon to amend its draft implementing directive as follows:
Introduction into the Union of specified fruits originating in third countries: in order to prevent citrus black spot, a fungal disease caused by
Phyllosticta citricarpa being introduced into the EU, Members called for:
a statement that an appropriate official inspection has been carried out in the field of production during the growing season, and no
symptoms of Phyllosticta citricarpa have been detected in the specified fruit since the beginning of the last cycle of vegetation;
a statement that a sample has been taken along the line between arrival and packaging in the packing facilities of at least 600 fruits of
each species per 30 tonnes, or part thereof, selected as much as possible on the basis of any possible symptom of Phyllosticta
citricarpa, and all sampled fruits showing symptoms have been tested and found free of that harmful organism;
in the case of Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck Valencia, an additional statement that a sample per 30 tonnes, or part thereof, has been
tested for latent infection and found free of Phyllosticta citricarpa.
Traceability requirements: the specified fruits shall be introduced into the Union only if they fulfil the following conditions:
the field of production, the packing facilities, exporters and any other operator involved in the handling of the specified fruits have been
officially registered for that purpose;
throughout their movement, from the field of production to the point of entry to the Union, the specified fruits have been accompanied by
documents issued under the supervision of the National Plant Protection Organisation;
in the case of the specified fruits originating in third countries, detailed information on the pre- and post-harvest treatments has been kept.
Cold treatment: Citrus fruit that could carry false codling moth (Thaumatotibia leucotreta) larvae should undergo cold treatment (24 days in
0.55ÂºC with 3 days precooling) or similar equally effective and sustainable treatment before being imported into the EU.
