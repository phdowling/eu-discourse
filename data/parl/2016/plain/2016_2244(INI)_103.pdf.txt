2016/2244(INI) - 17/05/2017 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection adopted the own-initiative report by Dennis de JONG (GUE/NGL, NL) on the
functioning of franchising in the retail sector.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, exercising its prerogative as an associated committee in accordance with Article 54 of the
Rules of Procedure, also gave its opinion on the report.
Members recalled that there is no common European definition of franchising and franchising agreements differ from one business to another.
They expressed disappointment that it is currently under-performing in the EU, representing only 1.89 % of GDP, as opposed to 5.95 % in the
USA and 10.83 % in Australia, 83.5 % of franchisings turnover being concentrated in only seven Member States.
This is why they proposed to encourage a wider dissemination of this business model throughout the EU insofar as it has a significant potential
cross-border dimension.
Guidelines: Members called on the Member States to apply effective measures against any unfair trading practices in the field of franchising.
Given the high degree of divergence between Member States, they considered it important that non-legislative homogeneous guidelines,
reflecting best practices, on the functioning of franchising in the retail sector be put in place.
The Commission should introduce guidelines on franchising contracts, in order to better shape the normative environment of franchising
contracts ensuring compliance with labour standards and decent and high-quality service.
Members stated that franchise agreements should fully respect the principles of balanced partnership, under which the franchisor and
franchisee must be reasonable and fair towards each other and resolve complaints, grievances and disputes through frank, transparent,
reasonable and direct communication.
The report stressed the need to:
encourage dialogue between franchisors, franchisees and decision-makers, to facilitate the creation of associations representing
franchisees, and to make sure that their voices are heard, whenever policies or legislation are prepared that may affect them;
include provisions relating to online sales in franchise agreements;
ensure that non-competition clauses should be clearly formulated, reasonable and proportionate and should not apply for a longer
duration than what is strictly necessary;
designate, in the Member States, contact points for information on problems encountered by franchisors and franchisees;
include specific principles to: (i) ensure the balanced contractual rights and obligations of the parties, such as clear, correct and
comprehensive pre-contractual information; (ii) set clear limits concerning confidentiality requirements, to be available in writing and
with sufficient notice prior to the signing of the agreement; (iii) the introduction of a cooling-off period after signing the agreement.
Members took note of the European Code of Ethics for Franchising, developed by the European Franchise Federation (EFF), as a potentially
efficient tool for promoting best practices in the franchising sector on a self-regulatory basis. They also noted that the Code has been subject

to fundamental criticism from franchisees and there were concerns about the lack of an independent enforcement mechanism.
Competition law: Members called for Commission Regulation (EU) No 330/2010 on the application of Article 101(3) of the Treaty on the
Functioning of the European Union to categories of vertical agreements and concerted practices to be uniformly applied in the Member States.
They invited the Commission to check to what extent application of the Regulation could be improved through a mechanism of assessment
within the European network of competition authorities.
The Commission is called on to check whether it is necessary to revise the Regulation and to verify and inform Parliament as regards:
whether the model of franchising adopted in the Regulation reflects market reality;
to what extent the so-called permitted vertical restraints are proportionate and have a negative effect on the market and consumers;
what new challenges franchisors and franchisees have to face in the context of e-commerce and digitisation;
collecting market information in terms of new trends, market developments regarding network organisation and technological
advances.

2016/2244(INI) - 12/09/2017 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 617 votes to 31, with 43 abstentions, a resolution on the functioning of franchising in the retail sector.
Members recalled that there is no common European definition of franchising and franchising agreements differ from one business to another.
Untapped potential: while the cross-border dimension of franchising could serve as a business model contributing to the achievement of the
single market in the retail sector, Parliament regretted that it is currently under-performing in the EU, representing only 1.89 % of GDP, as
opposed to 5.95 % in the USA and 10.83 % in Australia, 83.5 % of franchisings turnover being concentrated in only seven Member States,
which is why it is important to encourage a wider dissemination of this business model throughout the EU.
In its resolution of 11 December 2013, Parliament welcomed franchising as a business model which supports new business and
small-business ownership, but noted the existence of unfair contract terms in certain cases and called for transparent and fair contract terms.
Given that franchisees are often the weaker contracting party, particularly in the case of SMEs, Members insisted that franchising systems are
heavily dependent upon the functioning co-operation of franchisor and franchisees, taking into consideration that the franchising system
depends on good implementation by all parties. Franchisors have organised themselves both at national and European level for the
representation of their interests, whereas franchisees often lack such representative organisations defending their collective interests.
Promoting franchising: Members sought to encourage a wider dissemination of this business model throughout the Union.
The Commission is invited to:
introduce guidelines on franchising contracts, in order to better shape the normative environment of franchising contracts ensuring
compliance with labour standards and decent and high-quality service;
encourage dialogue between franchisors, franchisees and decision-makers, to facilitate the creation of associations representing
franchisees, and to make sure that their voices are heard, whenever policies or legislation are prepared that may affect them;
examine the functioning of franchising in the retail sector, including the existence of unfair contract terms or other unfair trading
practices;
open a public consultation in order to obtain unbiased information as to the real situation in franchising and to draft non-legislative
guidelines, reflecting best practices, on the functioning of franchising in the retail sector, in particular in relation to the latest
technological and market developments, such as internet sales, and to submit these to Parliament by January 2018 at the latest.
Parliament stated that franchise agreements should fully respect the principles of balanced partnership, under which the franchisor and
franchisee must be reasonable and fair towards each other and resolve complaints, grievances and disputes through frank, transparent,
reasonable and direct communication.
Sometimes franchisors require franchisees to purchase products and services that are not related to the franchise formula. Non-competition
clauses should be clearly formulated, reasonable and proportionate.
Competition law: the resolution stressed that Commission Regulation (EU) No 330/2010 on the application of Article 101(3) of the Treaty on
the Functioning of the European Union to categories of vertical agreements and concerted practices should be uniformly applied in the
Member States. It invited the Commission to check to what extent application of the Regulation could be improved through a mechanism of
assessment within the European network of competition authorities.
The Commission is called on to check whether it is necessary to revise the Regulation and to verify and inform Parliament as regards:
whether the model of franchising adopted in the Regulation reflects market reality;
to what extent the so-called permitted vertical restraints are proportionate and have a negative effect on the market and consumers;
what new challenges franchisors and franchisees have to face in the context of e-commerce and digitisation.
Parliament should be informed of the results achieved.
