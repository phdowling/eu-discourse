2016/2178(DEC) - 11/07/2016 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: presentation by the Commission of the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2015, as part of
the 2015 discharge procedure.
Analysis of the accounts of the European Police College (CEPOL).
CONTENT: the organisational governance of the EU consists of institutions, agencies and other EU bodies whose expenditure is included in
the general budget of the Union.
The EU's operational expenditure of these institutions takes different forms, depending on how the money is paid out and managed.
From 2014 onwards, the Commission classifies its expenditure as follows:
Direct management: the budget is implemented directly by the Commission services.
Indirect management: the Commission confers tasks of implementation of the budget to bodies of EU law or national law, such as the
EU agencies.
Shared management: under this method of budget implementation tasks are delegated to Member States. About 80 % of the
expenditure falls under this management mode covering such areas as agricultural spending and structural actions.
This Commission document concerns the EU's consolidated accounts for the year 2015 and details how spending by the EU institutions and
bodies was carried out. The consolidated annual accounts of the EU provide financial information on the activities of the institutions, agencies
and other bodies of the EU from an accrual accounting and budgetary perspective.
It is the responsibility of the Commission's Accounting Officer to prepare the EU's consolidated annual accounts and ensure that they present
fairly, in all material aspects, the financial position, the result of the operations and the cash flows of the EU institutions and bodies, including
the European Police College (CEPOL), with a view to granting discharge.

Discharge procedure: the final step of a budget lifecycle is the discharge of the budget for a given financial year. It represents the political
aspect of the external control of budget implementation and is the decision by which the European Parliament, acting on a Council
recommendation, "releases" the Commission (and other EU bodies) from its responsibility for management of a given budget by marking the
end of that budget's existence. The European Parliament is the discharge authority within the EU.
The discharge procedure may produce three outcomes: (i) the granting; (ii) postponement or; (iii) the refusal of the discharge.
The final discharge report including specific recommendations to the Commission for action is adopted in plenary by the European Parliament
and are subject to an annual follow up report in which the Commission outlines the concrete actions it has taken to implement the
recommendations made.
Each agency is subject to its own discharge procedure, including CEPOL.
CEPOL: CEPOL which is located in Budapest (HU) since October 2014 was established by Council Decision 2005/681/JHA. Its main task is to
provide training sessions, based on common standards, for senior police officers.
As regards CEPOLs accounts, these are presented in detail in the document on the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for
2015:
Commitment appropriations:
-

committed: EUR 9 million;

-

paid: EUR 9 million;

-

carried-over: 0.

Payment appropriations:
-

committed: EUR 10 million;

-

paid: EUR 8 million;

-

carried-over: EUR 2 million.

For further details on expenditure, please refer to the final accounts of CEPOL.

2016/2178(DEC) - 13/09/2016 Court of Auditors: opinion, report
PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the European Police College (CEPOL) for the financial
year 2015, together with the Colleges reply.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit focused on the annual accounts of the European Police College (CEPOL). The Colleges task is to function as a network and bring
together the national police training institutes in the Member States to provide training sessions, based on common standards, for senior police
officers.
Statement of Assurance: pursuant to the provisions of Article 287 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the Court
has audited:
the annual accounts of the College, which comprise the financial statements and the reports on the implementation of the budget for
the financial year ended 31 December 2015;
the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying those accounts.
Opinion on the reliability of the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the Colleges annual accounts present fairly, in all material respects, its
financial position as at 31 December 2015 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the
provisions of its Financial Regulation and the accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
Opinion on the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the accounts: the Court considers that the transactions underlying the
annual accounts for the year ended 31 December 2015 are legal and regular in all material respects.
The report made a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of the College, accompanied by the latters response.
The main observations may be summarised as follows:
The Courts observations:
budgetary management: the Court stated that the level of committed appropriations carried over was high for administrative
expenditure at EUR 212 456 mainly due to the Colleges relocation from the UK to Hungary in September 2014 and the consequential
need to initiate new service and supply contracts. Most of the services procured under these annual contracts had not been provided
by the end of 2015.
CEPOLs reply:
budgetary management: the College stated that the carry-over rate for administrative expenditure is high but justified having in view
the contract renewals or pending invoices at the end of year. CEPOL improved its budget management and commits to further
maintain compliance with the budgetary principle of annuality provided in the Financial Regulation. It should also be noted that CEPOL
has outsourced the role of Accounting Officer to the Accounting Officer of the European Commission.

Lastly, the Court of Auditors report also contained a summary of the Colleges key figures in 2015:
Budget: EUR 8.8 million (in payment appropriations).
Staff: 45 including officials, temporary and contract staff and seconded national experts.

2016/2178(DEC) - 07/02/2017 Supplementary non-legislative basic document
Having examined the revenue and expenditure accounts for the financial year 2015 and the balance sheet as at 31 December 2015 of the
European Police College (CEPOL), as well as the Court of Auditors' report on the annual accounts of the Agency for the financial year 2015,
accompanied by the Agency's replies to the Court's observations, the Council recommended the European Parliament to give a discharge to
the Executive Director of the Agency in respect of the implementation of the budget for the financial year 2015.
The Council welcomed the Court's opinion that, in all material respects, the Agency's annual accounts present fairly its financial position as at
31 December 2015 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions of the
Agency's Financial Regulation, and that the underlying transactions for 2015 are legal and regular in all material respects.
Nevertheless, some observations were made:
budget implementation: the Council invited the Agency to strengthen the agencies' budget reporting;
relocation: while acknowledging the particular impact of the Agency's relocation from the United Kingdom to Hungary, the Council
noted that, again, a high level of commitment appropriations was carried over to 2016. It encouraged the Agency to continue
improving its financial programming and monitoring of the budget implementation, in order to reduce the level of commitments carried
over to the following financial year to the minimum strictly necessary.

2016/2178(DEC) - 28/03/2017 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Inés AYALA SENDER (S&D, ES) on discharge in respect of the implementation of
the budget of the European Police College for the financial year 2015.
The committee called on the European Parliament to grant the Director of the College discharge in respect of the implementation of the
Colleges budget for the financial year 2015.
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it had obtained reasonable assurance that the annual accounts of the College for the financial year
2015 were reliable and that the underlying transactions were legal and regular, Members called on Parliament to approve the closure of the
Colleges accounts. They made, however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is granted,
in addition to the general recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU
agencies:
Colleges financial statements: Members noted that the final budget of the European Police College for the financial year 2015 was
EUR 8 471 000, representing an increase of 1.22 % compared to 2014.
Commitments and carry-overs: Members noted that, following the signature of the grant agreement with the Commission on the
EU/MENA Counter-Terrorism Training Partnership, a budget of EUR 2.5 million was agreed, out of which EUR 300 000 was inscribed
in the Colleges budget as assigned revenue in 2015 with the remaining EUR 2.2 million being transferred during 2016 and 2017. They
requested a thorough evaluation of this project and its added value for the security of the Union, and if beneficial, requests the
continuation and extension of the project in the coming years.
Relocation of CEPOL to Hungary: Members noted that the cost of the relocation from Bramshill, UK to Budapest, Hungary was
estimated at approximately EUR 1 006 515, to be spent during 2014 and 2015. They noted moreover that in accordance with the
agreement between the Commission and the UK, the amount of EUR 570 283 was financed with 50 % from the UK authorities and
with 50 % from the Commission. They acknowledged the fact that the UK contribution to the relocation funds was inscribed in the
Colleges budget as assigned revenue, which was fully used. They welcomed the fact that the remaining relocation funds
corresponding to 35 % of the final relocation budget were financed with the Colleges budget by savings deriving from the lower
correction coefficient applied to staff entitlements in Hungary. A number of staff members initiated a legal dispute against the College
concerning the conditions in which the relocation had been carried out and its financial impact on their income. Members
acknowledged that the final amount for the cost of relocation needs to cover the financial obligation arising from the Courts judgement
and invites the College to report on the outcome and the final financial figure of the relocation.
Members also made a series of observations regarding budgetary and financial management, transfers, procurement and recruitment
procedures, the prevention and management of conflicts of interests and internal audits and controls.
On performance, Members stated that in 2015 the Colleges training portfolio encompassed 151 training activities, including 85 residential
activities and 66 webinars, 428 exchanges in the framework of the European Police Exchange Programme (EPEP), 24 online modules, one
online course, and nine common curricula. They noted with satisfaction that for the fifth year in a row the outreach of the College has
increased, resulting in the College training 12 992 law enforcement professionals in 2015 compared to 10 322 in 2014.
Lastly, Members noted that, with regard to the Colleges expanded responsibilities and increased mandate, the current resource levels are
insufficient. There is a significant need for reinforcement in both human and financial resources. Therefore, the Commission is called upon to
take this into account in its budget proposals for the College.

2016/2178(DEC) - 27/04/2017 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament decided to grant discharge to the Executive Director of the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training
discharge in respect of the implementation of its budget for the financial year 2015.

The vote on the decision on discharge covers the closure of the accounts (in accordance with Annex IV, Article 5 (1) (a) to Parliaments Rules
of Procedure).
Noting that the Court of Auditors has stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the Agencys annual accounts for the financial year
2015 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Parliament adopted by 502 votes to 108 with 13 abstentions, a
resolution containing a series of recommendations, which form an integral part of the decision on discharge and which add to the general
recommendations set out in the resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies.
These recommendations may be summarised as follows:
Agencys financial statements: Parliament noted that the final budget of the Agency for the financial year 2015 was EUR 8 471 000,
representing an increase of 1.22 % compared to 2014.
Commitments and carry-overs: It noted that, following the signature of the grant agreement with the Commission on the EU/MENA
Counter-Terrorism Training Partnership, a budget of EUR 2.5 million was agreed, out of which EUR 300 000 was inscribed in the
Agencys budget as assigned revenue in 2015 with the remaining EUR 2.2 million being transferred during 2016 and 2017. It
requested a thorough evaluation of this project and its added value for the security of the Union, and if beneficial, requests the
continuation and extension of the project in the coming years.
Relocation of the Agency to Hungary: Parliament noted that the cost of the relocation from Bramshill, UK to Budapest, Hungary was
estimated at approximately EUR 1 006 515, to be spent during 2014 and 2015. It noted moreover that in accordance with the
agreement between the Commission and the UK, the amount of EUR 570 283 was financed with 50 % from the UK authorities and
with 50 % from the Commission. It acknowledged the fact that the UK contribution to the relocation funds was inscribed in the Agencys
budget as assigned revenue, which was fully used. It welcomed the fact that the remaining relocation funds corresponding to 35 % of
the final relocation budget were financed with the Agencys budget by savings deriving from the lower correction coefficient applied to
staff entitlements in Hungary. A number of staff members initiated a legal dispute against the Agency concerning the conditions in
which the relocation had been carried out and its financial impact on their income. Members acknowledged that the final amount for
the cost of relocation needs to cover the financial obligation arising from the Courts judgement and invites the Agency to report on the
outcome and the final financial figure of the relocation.
Parliament also made a series of observations regarding budgetary and financial management, transfers, procurement and recruitment
procedures, the prevention and management of conflicts of interests and internal audits and controls.
On performance, Parliament stated that in 2015 the Agencys training portfolio encompassed 151 training activities, including 85 residential
activities and 66 webinars, 428 exchanges in the framework of the European Police Exchange Programme (EPEP), 24 online modules, one
online course, and nine common curricula. It noted with satisfaction that for the fifth year in a row the outreach of the Agency has increased,
resulting in the Agency training 12 992 law enforcement professionals in 2015 compared to 10 322 in 2014.
Parliament welcomed that in 2015 the Agency organised webinars to provide law enforcement officials with up-to-date information and best
practice on identifying and investigating hate crimes and different forms of gender-based violence, and offered trainings to raise awareness
about the challenges experienced by Roma communities and LGBTI persons (such as over- and under-policing and the lack of trust towards
members of the police force).
Lastly, Parliament noted that, with regard to the Agencys expanded responsibilities and increased mandate, the current resource levels are
insufficient. There is a significant need for reinforcement in both human and financial resources. Therefore, the Commission is called upon to
take this into account in its budget proposals for the Agency.

2016/2178(DEC) - 27/04/2017 Final act
PURPOSE: to grant discharge to the European Police College (CEPOL) for the financial year 2015.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision (EU) 2017/1645 of the European Parliament on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of
the European Police College (now European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training) (CEPOL) for the financial year 2015.
CONTENT: with the present decision, the European Parliament grants discharge to the Executive Director of the European Union Agency for
Law Enforcement Training discharge in respect of the implementation of the Agency's budget for the financial year 2015.
This decision is in line with the European Parliament's resolution adopted on 27 April 2017 and comprises a series of observations that form
an integral part of the discharge decision (please refer to the summary of the opinion of 27 April 2017).
Amongst Parliaments main observations in the resolution accompanying the discharge decision, the latter deplored the fact that, despite the
adoption of the College's policy on the prevention and management of conflict of interests in November 2014, the curricula vitae and
declarations of interest of its experts are not published on the College's website. It also called upon the College to adopt a clear and solid
whistleblowing strategy and rules against revolving doors.
