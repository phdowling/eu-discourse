Summary

2016/2770(RSP) - 23/06/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a resolution on the massacres in eastern Congo.
The text adopted in plenary was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ECR, ALDE, Greens/EFA and EFDD groups.
Parliament expressed its deep concern regarding the escalation of violence and the alarming and deteriorating humanitarian situation in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, caused in particular by the armed conflicts in the eastern provinces, which have now been going on for
more than 20 years.
Parliament reiterated its call for all parties to the conflict to put an immediate end to the violence, lay down their arms, release all children from
their ranks and promote dialogue towards a peaceful and sustainable resolution of the conflict.
It called notably for quick and active resumption of collaboration between MONUSCO and the RDC armed forces (FARDC), on the basis of the
military cooperation agreement signed on 28 January 2016 in Kinshasa.
Massacres and sexual violence: Parliament called as a matter of urgency for a thorough, independent and transparent investigation to be
launched by the international community into the massacres carried out between October 2014 and May 2016 in the territories of Beni, Lubero
and Butembo where more than 1 160 people were savagely killed, more than 1 470 people disappeared, and many women, men and children
victims of sexual violence.
Members asked for an emergency meeting of the Team of International Envoys and Representatives for the Great Lakes region of Africa on
elections in the DRC with a view to taking appropriate action in this direction, such as mobilising the UN Security Council.
While insisting on the holding of elections, Members reiterated that there can be no impunity for perpetrators of human rights violations, war
crimes in this country.
Monusco: Members asked for an evaluation report of the actions of MONUSCO to be produced and made publicly available. They welcomed
UN Security Council resolution 2277 (2016), which renewed MONUSCOs mandate and reinforced its competences in the field of civilian
protection and human rights, including gender-based violence and violence against children.
Political dialogue: Members called for the African Union and the EU to ensure a permanent political dialogue between the countries of the
Great Lakes region in order to prevent any further destabilisation. They insisted that civil society must be involved in any action to protect
civilians and resolve the conflicts.
The EU and its Member States are called upon to maintain their assistance to the people of the DRC in order to improve the living conditions
of the most vulnerable sections of the population, in particular the internally displaced.
Parliament condemned all attacks against humanitarian actors and impediments to humanitarian access.
Lastly, it welcomed the Congolese authorities efforts to implement the legislation which forbids trading in and processing of minerals in areas
where there is illegal exploitation of minerals, such as those controlled by armed groups.
