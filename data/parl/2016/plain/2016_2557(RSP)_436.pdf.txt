Summary

The European Parliament adopted a resolution on Bahrain: the case of Mohammed Ramada.
The text adopted in plenary was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ALDE, GUE/NGL, Greens/EFA and EFDD groups.
Members recalled that Mr Ramadan was allegedly arrested without a warrant and tortured. On 29 December 2014, a Bahraini criminal court
sentenced Mr Ramadan and Mr Moosa to death based on allegations of terrorism.
Members expressed its concern and disappointment over Bahrains return to the practice of capital punishment and condemned firmly the
continuing use of torture and other cruel or degrading treatment or punishment against prisoners by the security forces.
They stressed the obligation to ensure that human rights defenders are protected and allowed to conduct their work without hindrance,
intimidation or harassment and called on the competent authorities to undertake a prompt and impartial investigation into all allegations of
torture, not without reminding the Bahraini authorities that Article 15 of the Convention Against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading
Treatment or Punishment prohibits the use of any statement made as a result of torture as evidence in any proceedings.
Parliament stressed the importance of the support given to Bahrain, in particular as regards its judicial system, with a view to ensuring
compliance with international human rights standards. It called on the Bahraini authorities to lift the arbitrary travel ban on Nabeel Rajab and to
drop all pending free-speech-related charges against him.
