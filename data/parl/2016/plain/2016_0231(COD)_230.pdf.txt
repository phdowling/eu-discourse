Summary

2016/0231(COD) - 20/07/2016 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to achieve a reduction at EU level of 30% in greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by 2030 compared to 2005, in all sectors that are
not part of the Emission Trading System (non-ETS sectors) in order to implement EU commitments under the Paris agreement.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides following the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing
with Council.
BACKGROUND : the Commission considers that with current policies, GHG emissions are not expected to sufficiently decrease to reach the
European Union's target of at least 40% reductions on 1990 by 2030 and, more specifically, a 30% GHG reduction in non-ETS sectors
compared to 2005. Under current trends and with full implementation of existing legally binding targets and policies, emissions covered by the
Effort Sharing Decision ('ESD') are only projected to decrease by around 24% below 2005 levels in 2030 . Hence, national reduction targets,
which provide the incentive for further policies driving deeper reductions, are required.
The proposal is an important element of the strategic framework for the Energy Union. It aims to implement the Paris Agreement on Climate
Change (December 2015), which includes a long-term goal to keep the global temperature increase well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels
and to pursue efforts to keep it to below 1.5°C. The EU's climate objective is to reduce GHG emissions by 80-95% in 2050 compared to 1990,
in the context of necessary reductions by developed countries as a group. In order to achieve the European Union's domestic long-term
objective to cut emissions by at least 80% by 2050, continued progress is needed for a transition to a low-carbon economy.
IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the impact assessment considered options for implementing the reduction in the non-ETS sectors other than the
LULUCF sectors, building upon the current ESD and the guidance given by the European Council. The impact assessment looks at what the
impact of the proposal would be on fairness, cost efficiency, and environmental integrity.
CONTENT : the proposal lays down the minimum contributions of Member States to emission reductions for the period from 2021 to 2030 and
the rules for determining the annual emissions allocations and those on evaluation on progress. The reductions aim to promote improvements,
particularly in the sectors building, agriculture, waste management and transport.
Annual emission levels for the period from 2021 to 2030: the proposal lays down Member States emission limits in 2030 as set in Annex I, and
the rules on how emission levels are determined for 2021-2030:
all Member States will have national emission targets for 2030 expressed as a percentage reduction from 2005 emission levels as well
as access to new flexibilities to achieve those targets cost effectively. Collectively, these national targets give an overall EU reduction
of 30% in the sectors covered by the proposal. The 2030 targets range from 0% to -40% compared to 2005 levels;
the annual emission levels are determined based on a linear trajectory starting with average emissions for 2016-2018 based on the
most recent reviewed GHG emission data. Annual emissions allocations (AEAs) in CO2 equivalent for each Member State for each
year of the period will be set out in an implementing act ;
different capacities of Member States to take action are recognised by differentiating targets according to GDP per capita across
Member States.
Flexibility instruments to achieve annual limits: the proposal sets out the flexibility available to Member States to achieve their annual limits
including flexibility over time through banking and borrowing of annual emissions allocations (AEAs) within the commitment period, and
flexibility between Member States through transfers of AEAs. In particular, two new flexibilities are introduced, which will allow Member States
to reach their targets cost efficiently.
One-off flexibility for certain Member States to access allowances from the EU Emissions Trading System: the new flexibility allows
eligible Member States to achieve their national targets by covering some emissions in the non-Emission Trading System sectors with
EU Emission Trading System allowances which would normally have been auctioned, generating revenue for that Member State;
Flexibility to access credits from the land use sector (LULUCF): the proposal permits up to 280 million tonnes of CO2 to be credited
from certain land categories to be used for national targets over the entire period from 2021-2030. The flexibility applies only to net
credits generated at national level by deforested land, afforested land, managed cropland and managed grassland.
Corrective action: if, based on the annual evaluation performed by the Commission, a Member State's progress deviates from its annual
emission allocation, that Member State will need to prepare an action plan with additional measures to be implemented in order to ensure that
it will comply with its obligations.

Compliance check: the compliance check on GHG emissions from each Member State will take place every five years, and no longer
annually, for each of the previous years of the period. Should a Member State be found to be non-compliant with its annual emissions
allocations for any year of the period, corrective action in the form of the addition to the next year's emissions of a quantity equal to the amount
in tonnes of CO2 equivalents of the excess emissions multiplied by a factor of 1.08 will apply.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has very limited implications for the EU budget (EUR 3346 for the period 2017-2020).
The indirect impacts on Member States budgets will depend on their choice of national policies and measures for GHG emission reductions
and other mitigation action in sectors covered by this initiative. The proposal provides for continued annual reporting but with less frequent
compliance checks. This will reduce the administrative costs for Member States.
DELEGATED ACTS : the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of
the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

2016/0231(COD) - 06/06/2017 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety adopted the report by Gerben-Jan GERBRANDY (ADLE, NL) on the
proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on binding annual greenhouse gas emission reductions by Member
States from 2021 to 2030 for a resilient Energy Union and to meet commitments under the Paris Agreement and amending Regulation No
525/2013 of the European Parliament and the Council on a mechanism for monitoring and reporting greenhouse gas emissions and other
information relevant to climate change.
The committee recommended that the European Parliaments position adopted at first reading, following the ordinary legislative procedure,
should amend the Commission proposal as follows:
Objective: Members stated that the general objective of this Regulation is to set the Union on track to a low-carbon economy through the
establishment of a predictable long-term pathway to reducing by 2050 the greenhouse gas emissions of the Union by 80 to 95% compared to
1990 levels.
Shipping emissions should be covered under this Regulation unless they are included in the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS).
Linear trajectory: the approach of setting binding annual emission limits set out in Decision No 406/2009/ EC of the European Parliament and
of the Council should be maintained during the period from 2021 to 2030, following a linear trajectory starting in 2018 (instead of 2020).
Long-term emission reductions trajectory from 2031: each Member State shall ensure that its greenhouse gas emissions in each year between
2031 and 2050 do not exceed the level defined by a linear trajectory, starting from its annual emission allocations for 2030 and ending in 2050
on a level of emissions that is 80% below the 2005 level for that Member State.
Flexibility in respect of annual limits: a Member State may transfer:
up to 10% of its annual emission allocation for a given year to other Member States for the years 2021 to 2025;
up to 5% of its annual emission allocation for a given year to other Member States for the years 2026 to 2029.
A Member State whose greenhouse gas emissions for a given year are below its annual emission allocation for that year, taking into account
the use of flexibilities may:
in respect of the years 2021 to 2025, bank the excess part of its annual emission allocation up to a level of 10% of its annual emission
allocation to subsequent years until 2025;
in respect of the years 2026 to 2029 a Member State may bank the excess part of its annual emission allocation up to a level of 5% of
its annual emission allocation to subsequent years until 2030.
A Member State shall not transfer any part of its annual emission allocation if, at the time of transfer, that Member State's emissions exceed its
annual emission allocation.
Access to the flexibility shall be granted on condition that the Member States concerned commit to taking measures in other sectors where
insufficient results have been achieved in the past.
Margin of manoeuvre for land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) activities: Members proposed a downward adjustment to the
LULUCF Level of LULUCF credits (EUR 190 million, instead of the proposed EUR 280 million).
The Member States concerned shall submit by 1 January 2019 an action plan to the Commission that sets out measures, including where
relevant the use of Union financing, for climate efficient farming and for the land-use and forest sectors. The Commission may issue opinions
on the action plans submitted by Member States.
Early action reserve: Members proposed that early action reserve rewards early action and allows Member States to use additional allocations
for compliance, in case other flexibilities are not sufficient. In order to take into account early action before 2020, a quantity not exceeding a
total sum of 70 million tonnes in annual emission allocations in the period 2026 to 2030 shall, upon request of a Member State, be taken into
account. The relative amount of additional allocations available to a Member State should depend on the degree of overachievement of its
2020 target.
European register: the European Register system shall be transparent and include all relevant information regarding the transfer of allowances
between Member States. This information shall be accessible to the public through a dedicated website hosted by the Commission.
Climate impact of Union funding: the Commission shall carry out a comprehensive, cross-sectorial study of the impact of funding granted from
the Union budget or otherwise pursuant to Union law on the mitigation of climate change. By 1 January 2019, the Commission shall present to
the European Parliament and the Council a report on the findings of the study which shall be accompanied, if appropriate, by legislative
proposals aimed at discontinuing any Union funding which is not compatible with the CO2 reduction targets or policies of the Union.
Review: the Union shall submit every five years a contribution reflecting its highest possible ambition. The review shall take into account the

Unions objective to reduce economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions by 80-95% by 2050 compared to the 1990 level and the goal of the Paris
Agreement.

2016/0231(COD) - 14/06/2017 Text adopted by Parliament, partial vote at 1st reading/single
reading
The European Parliament adopted by 534 votes to 88, with 56 abstentions, amendments to the proposal for a regulation of the European
Parliament and of the Council on binding annual greenhouse gas emission reductions by Member States from 2021 to 2030 for a resilient
Energy Union and to meet commitments under the Paris Agreement and amending Regulation No 525/2013 of the European Parliament and
the Council on a mechanism for monitoring and reporting greenhouse gas emissions and other information relevant to climate change.
The matter was referred back to the committee responsible for interinstitutional negotiations.
The main amendments adopted in plenary were as follows:
Objective: Parliament stressed that the proposed Regulation was intended to implement the Paris Agreement, which entered into force on 4
November 2016 and whose objective is to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, in the context of sustainable
development and efforts to eradicate poverty.
The proposed Regulation shall set the Union on track to a low-carbon economy through the establishment of a predictable long-term pathway
to reducing by 2050 the greenhouse gas emissions of the Union by 80 to 95% compared to 1990 levels .
Shipping emissions should be covered under this Regulation unless they are included in the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS).
Linear trajectory: each Member State shall follow an emission reduction plan, which shall be calculated on a trajectory starting in 2018 and not
in 2020 as proposed by the European Commission.
Long-term emission reductions trajectory from 2031: each Member State shall ensure that its greenhouse gas emissions do not exceed the
level defined by a linear trajectory, starting from its annual emission allocations for 2030 and ending in 2050 on a level of emissions that is
80% below the 2005 level for that Member State.
Flexibility in respect of annual limits: in order to achieve these objectives, a Member State may transfer:
up to 10% of its annual emission allocation for a given year to other Member States for the years 2021 to 2025 (up to 5% for the years
2026 to 2029);
in respect of the years 2026 to 2029 a Member State may bank the excess part of its annual emission allocation up to a level of 5% of
its annual emission allocation to subsequent years until 2025;
up to 5% of its annual emission allocation for a given year to other Member States in respect of the years 2021 to 2025, and up to
10% in respect of the years 2026 to 2030.
A Member State shall not transfer any part of its annual emission allocation if, at the time of transfer, that Member State's emissions exceed its
annual emission allocation.
Access to the flexibility shall be granted on condition that the Member States concerned commit to taking measures in other sectors where
insufficient results have been achieved in the past.
Margin of manoeuvre for LULUCF activities: Parliament endorsed the Commission proposal for an additional use of up to EUR 280 million net
removals from land use, land use change and forestry.
The Member States concerned shall submit by 1 January 2019 an action plan to the Commission that sets out measures, including where
relevant the use of Union financing, for climate efficient farming and for the land-use and forest sectors. The Commission may issue opinions
on the action plans submitted by Member States.
Early action reserve: Members proposed that early action reserve rewards early action and allows Member States to use additional allocations
for compliance, in case other flexibilities are not sufficient. In order to take into account early action before 2020, a quantity not exceeding a
total sum of 90 million tonnes in annual emission allocations in the period 2026 to 2030 shall, upon request of a Member State, be taken into
account. The relative amount of additional allocations available to a Member State should depend on the degree of overachievement of its
2020 target.
Climate impact of Union funding: the Commission shall study the impact of funding granted from the Union budget or otherwise pursuant to
Union law on the mitigation of climate change.
By 1 January 2019, the Commission shall present to the European Parliament and the Council a report on the findings of the study which shall
be accompanied, if appropriate, by legislative proposals aimed at discontinuing any Union funding which is not compatible with the CO2
reduction targets or policies of the Union.
European register: the European Register system shall be transparent and include all relevant information regarding the transfer of allowances
between Member States. This information shall be accessible to the public through a dedicated website hosted by the Commission.
Review: the Union shall submit every five years a contribution reflecting its highest possible ambition. The review shall take into account the
Unions objective to reduce economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions by 80-95% by 2050 compared to the 1990 level and the goal of the Paris
Agreement.
