Briefing

2016/0107(COD) - 12/04/2016 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to complement existing obligations of companies to disclose financial information in order to improve fairness and tax
transparency.
PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: in recent years, the challenge posed by corporate income tax avoidance has increased considerably and has become a
major focus of concern within the Union and globally.
The Commission in its communications entitled Commission Work Programme 2016 - No time for business as usual and Commission Work
Programme 2015 - A New Start identified as a priority the need to move to a system whereby the country in which profits are generated is also
the country of taxation.
The Commission announced in March 2015, a comprehensive list of initiatives in its Action Plan on a Fairer Corporate Tax System and
proposed as part of the subsequent Anti-Tax Avoidance Package (ATAP), to implement in the Union Action 13 of the OECD Action Plan
endorsed by the G20 to fight base erosion and profit shifting (hereafter, BEPS).
Responding to the calls from the G20 and elsewhere, greater transparency on the side of companies is needed to enable public scrutiny of
whether tax is paid where profits are produced.
The European Parliament in its resolution of 16 December 2015 on bringing transparency, coordination and convergence to corporate tax
policies in the Union acknowledged that increased transparency in the area of corporate taxation can improve tax collection, make the work of
tax authorities more efficient and ensure increased public trust and confidence in tax systems and governments.
IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option identified in the impact assessment is the one concerning a public country-by-country reporting
on worldwide operations broken down by EU Member State and aggregated for non-EU operations.
In terms of societal benefits, this initiative responds to the increased demand for transparency regarding the tax affairs of multinational
enterprise groups. By providing more information in a more convenient form, it should also contribute to increasing public trust in the fairness
of the tax systems.
CONTENT: this proposal seeks to amend Directive 2013/34/EU with a view to providing the tax administration with a complete set of
information required to consider potential harmful tax practices rather than to provide the wider public with a general set of country-by-country
data to improve transparency. It requires the multinational enterprises to disclose publicly certain items of the information submitted to tax
authorities.
Scope of the proposal: the proposal applies to all EU and non-EU MNEs with a consolidated turnover of at least EUR 750 million, having
activities in the EU by way of at least an establishment. This is the same threshold as that set out in the OECD/BEPS and in the ATAP.
According to the OECD, based on this threshold, only 10-15% of MNEs will be required to submit a CBCR; but the turnover of those MNEs will
represent approximately 90% of the turnover of all MNEs. Small and medium-sized companies, who represent more than 95?% of all
companies in the EU, are not affected by the proposal.
For any MNE headquartered in a third country, the obligation will fall on its subsidiaries or branches in the EU unless the non-EU MNE makes
the CBCR group report publicly accessible and indicates which subsidiary or branch in the EU is responsible for the publication of the CBCR
on behalf of the "parent" company.
Banking groups: where these are multinational enterprises which fall within the scope of this initiative, they will be exempted from the
obligation to report on income tax information, provided that the report disclosed under Article 89 of Directive 2013/36/EU encompasses the
activities of the ultimate parent undertaking in the EU and of all of its affiliated undertakings.
Content of the report on income tax information: disclosed information includes: (i) the nature of the activities, (ii) the number of persons
employed; (iii) the net turnover made (including with related parties); (iv) the profit made before tax; (v) the amount of income tax due in the
country as a reason of the profit made in the current year; (vi) the actual payments made to the country's treasury during that year; (vii) the
amount of accumulated earnings.

In order to ensure a level of detail that will enable citizens to better assess how MNEs contribute to welfare in each Member State, the
information should be broken down by Member State. In addition, because some third countries refuse to respect good governance standards
in taxation and pose specific tax challenges, the information on operations of MNEs should also be shown with a high level of detail.
Publication: the consolidated report on income tax information will be published in a business register with the objective of ensuring certainty
and availability over time. Moreover, as the objective of this initiative is to enable public scrutiny, those reports will also be made accessible to
the public on company websites. To allow for comparisons over time, reports will remain accessible for at least five consecutive years on the
websites.
Enforcement: enforcement of this initiative will be ensured with a combination of provisions. Member States should introduce collective
responsibility of the administrative, management and supervisory bodies for these reports.
The statutory auditor of any local subsidiary in charge will have to verify whether the CBCR has been provided and made accessible on the
Internet. In the case of a branch of a third country multinational enterprises, that responsibility will be borne by those persons in charge of
disclosure formalities.
Lastly, Directive 2013/34/EU will apply, ensuring that infringements will be sanctioned by effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties for
MNEs or their subsidiaries or branches.
DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of
the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

2016/0107(COD) - 21/06/2017 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Committee on Legal Affairs jointly adopted the report by Hugues BAYET (S&D,
BE) and Evelyn REGNER (S&D, AT) on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive
2013/34/EU as regards disclosure of income tax information by certain undertakings and branches.
The committee recommended that the European Parliaments position adopted at first reading, following the ordinary legislative procedure,
should amend the Commission proposal as follows:
Members recalled that the European Parliament has long been calling for public country-by-country reporting (CBCR) on tax-relevant company
data which it considers as a key element in the fight against international tax evasion and tax avoidance. However, there is a need for
enhanced transparency and public scrutiny on corporate income tax.
Increased transparency: an amendment stressed that the report on income tax information shall be published in a common template, available
for free in an open data format and made accessible to the public on the website of the undertaking on the date of its publication in at least one
of the official languages of the Union. On the same date, the undertaking shall also file the report in a public registry managed by the
Commission.
The information shall be presented in the common template and shall comprise the following, broken down by tax jurisdiction:
the name of the ultimate undertaking and, where applicable, the list of all its subsidiaries, a brief description of the nature of their
activities and their respective geographical location;
the number of employees on a full-time equivalent basis;
fixed assets other than cash or cash equivalents;
the amount of the net turnover, including a distinction between the turnover made with related parties and the turnover made with
unrelated parties;
stated capital;
whether undertakings, subsidiaries or branches benefit from a preferential tax treatment from a patent box or equivalent regimes.
Where a Member State comprises several tax jurisdictions, the information shall be presented separately for each tax jurisdiction.
Temporary omissions: in order to protect commercially sensitive information and to ensure fair competition, Member States may allow that one
or more of the specific items of information listed above be temporarily omitted from the report as regards activities in one or more specific tax
jurisdictions when they are of a nature such that their disclosure would be seriously prejudicial to the commercial position of the undertakings.
Guidelines: the Commission shall, by means of a delegated act, adopt guidelines to assist Member States defining cases where the
publication of information shall be considered seriously prejudicial to the commercial position of the undertakings to which it relates.
Reporting: the Commission shall present a report on the compliance with and the impact of the reporting obligations. The report shall include
an evaluation of whether the report on income tax information delivers appropriate and proportionate results, and shall assess the costs and
benefits of lowering the consolidated net turnover threshold beyond which undertakings and branches are required to report on income tax
information.
Review: no later than 4 years after the adoption of this Directive, the Commission shall review the following:
undertakings and branches required to report on income tax information, particularly whether it would be appropriate to enlarge the
scope of this Chapter to include large undertakings;
the content of the report on income tax information;
the temporary derogations provided for in Directive.
The Commission shall submit the report to the European Parliament and to the Council, together with a legislative proposal, if appropriate.
Sanctions: Member States shall at least provide for administrative measures and penalties for the infringement by undertakings of national
provisions.

2016/0107(COD) - 04/07/2017 Text adopted by Parliament, partial vote at 1st reading/single

reading
The European Parliament adopted by 534 votes to 98, with 62 abstentions, amendments to the proposal for a directive of the European
Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2013/34/EU as regards disclosure of income tax information by certain undertakings and
branches.
The matter was referred back to the competent committees for interinstitutional negotiations.
Members stressed that a coordinated and harmonised approach to the implementation of national tax systems is essential for the smooth
functioning of the single market and for preventing tax evasion and the transfer of profits. Public country-by-country reporting is an effective
instrument for increasing transparency in the activities of multinational enterprises.
The main amendments adopted in plenary were as follows:
Increased transparency of information: ultimate parent undertakings governed by their national laws and having a consolidated net turnover of
EUR 750 million or more should make publicly available free of charge a report on income tax information on an annual basis.
The report on income tax information would be published in a common template, available for free in an open data format and made
accessible to the public on the companys website on the date of its publication in at least one of the EUs official languages. On the same date,
the company shall also file the report in a public registry managed by the Commission.
Companies established only in the territory of a single Member State and in no other tax jurisdiction shall be exempted from the application of
those rules.
The information shall be presented in the common template and comprise the following, broken down by tax jurisdiction:
the name of the ultimate mother-company and, where applicable, the list of all its subsidiaries, a brief description of the nature of their
activities and their respective geographical location;
the number of employees on a full-time equivalent basis;
fixed assets other than cash or cash equivalents;
the amount of the net turnover, including a distinction between the turnover made with related parties and the turnover made with
unrelated parties;
stated capital;
details of public subsidies received and any donations made to politicians, political organisations or political foundations;
whether companies, subsidiaries or branches benefit from a preferential tax treatment from a patent box or equivalent regimes.
Where a Member State comprises several tax jurisdictions, the information shall be presented separately for each tax jurisdiction, including
each tax jurisdiction outside the EU.
Temporary omissions: in order to protect commercially sensitive information and to ensure fair competition, Member States may allow that one
or more of the specific items of information listed above be temporarily omitted from the report as regards activities in one or more specific tax
jurisdictions when they are of a nature such that their disclosure would be seriously prejudicial to the commercial position of the companies.
The omission should be accompanied by a reasoned explanation and be subject to the prior approval of the competent national authority.
Member States should notify the Commission of all temporary derogations. The Commission should monitor the use of this derogation.
Guidelines: the Commission shall, by means of a delegated act, adopt guidelines to assist Member States to define cases where the
publication of information would be considered seriously prejudicial to the commercial position of the companies to which it relates.
Reporting: the Commission shall present a report on the compliance with and the impact of the reporting obligations. The report shall include
an evaluation of whether the report on income tax information delivers appropriate and proportionate results, and shall assess the costs and
benefits of lowering the consolidated net turnover threshold beyond which companies and branches are required to report on income tax
information.
Review: no later than 4 years after the adoption of this directive, the Commission shall review the following:

·

companies and branches required to report on income tax information, particularly whether it would be appropriate to enlarge the
scope of this Chapter to include large companies;

·

the content of the report on income tax information;

·

the temporary derogations provided for in the directive.

The Commission shall submit the report to the European Parliament and to the Council, together with a legislative proposal, if appropriate.
Sanctions: Member States shall at least provide for administrative measures and penalties for the infringement by companies of national
provisions.
