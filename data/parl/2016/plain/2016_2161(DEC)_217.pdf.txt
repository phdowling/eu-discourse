2016/2161(DEC) - 11/07/2016 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: presentation by the Commission of the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2015, as part of
the 2015 discharge procedure.
Analysis of the accounts of the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop).
CONTENT: the organisational governance of the EU consists of institutions, agencies and other EU bodies whose expenditure is included in
the general budget of the Union.
The EU's operational expenditure of these institutions takes different forms, depending on how the money is paid out and managed.
From 2014 onwards, the Commission classifies its expenditure as follows:
Direct management: the budget is implemented directly by the Commission services.
Indirect management: the Commission confers tasks of implementation of the budget to bodies of EU law or national law, such as the
EU agencies.
Shared management: under this method of budget implementation tasks are delegated to Member States. About 80 % of the
expenditure falls under this management mode covering such areas as agricultural spending and structural actions.
This Commission document concerns the EU's consolidated accounts for the year 2015 and details how spending by the EU institutions and
bodies was carried out. The consolidated annual accounts of the EU provide financial information on the activities of the institutions, agencies

and other bodies of the EU from an accrual accounting and budgetary perspective.
It is the responsibility of the Commission's Accounting Officer to prepare the EU's consolidated annual accounts and ensure that they present
fairly, in all material aspects, the financial position, the result of the operations and the cashflows of the EU institutions and bodies, including
the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (CEDEFOP), with a view to granting discharge.
Discharge procedure: the final step of a budget lifecycle is the discharge of the budget for a given financial year. It represents the political
aspect of the external control of budget implementation and is the decision by which the European Parliament, acting on a Council
recommendation, "releases" the Commission (and other EU bodies) from its responsibility for management of a given budget by marking the
end of that budget's existence. The European Parliament is the discharge authority within the EU.
The discharge procedure may produce three outcomes: (i) the granting; (ii) postponement or; (iii) the refusal of the discharge.
The final discharge report including specific recommendations to the Commission for action is adopted in plenary by the European Parliament
and are subject to an annual follow up report in which the Commission outlines the concrete actions it has taken to implement the
recommendations made.
Each agency is subject to its own discharge procedure, including Cedefop.
Cedefop: the Centre, which is located in Thessaloniki (EL) and established by Council Regulation (EEC) No 337/75 has the task of compiling
and disseminating documentation on vocational training systems and on matters relating to the development of vocational training.
As regards the Centres accounts, these are presented in detail in the document on the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union
for 2015:
Commitment appropriations:
-

committed: EUR 19 million;

-

paid: EUR 19 million;

-

carried-over: 0.

Payment appropriations:
-

committed: EUR 20 million;

-

paid: EUR 17 million;

-

carried-over: EUR 2 million.

For further details on expenditure, please refer to the final accounts of the CEDEFOP.

2016/2161(DEC) - 13/09/2016 Court of Auditors: opinion, report
PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the European Centre for the Development of Vocational
Training (CEDEFOP) for the financial year 2015, together with the Centres reply.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit concerned, amongst others, the annual accounts of the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (CEDEFOP).
In brief, the Centres main task is to compile and disseminate documentation on vocational training systems.
Statement of assurance: pursuant to the provisions of Article 287 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the Court
has audited:
the annual accounts of the Centre, which comprise the financial statements and the reports on the implementation of the budget for
the financial year ended 31 December 2015;
the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying those accounts.
Opinion on the reliability of the accounts: the Court considered that the Centres annual accounts present fairly, in all material respects, its
financial position as at 31 December 2015 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the
provisions of its Financial Regulation and the accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
Opinion on the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the accounts: the Court considered that the transactions underlying the
annual accounts for the year ended 31 December 2015 are legal and regular in all material respects.
The report also makes a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of the Agency, accompanied by the latters
response. The main observations may be summarised as follows:
The Courts observations:
budgetary management: the Court noted that the level of committed appropriations carried over was high for administrative
expenditure due to the high volume of network and other IT equipment required for the refurbishment of the repaired areas of the
Centres building.
The Centres replies:
budgetary management: Cedefop replied that it continues to use its funds effectively and efficiently with an overall budget
implementation rate of 98.5 %. Of the EUR 425 877 brought forward to 2015, only EUR 17 068 was eventually cancelled (or 4 %).

Lastly, the report contains a summary of the Centres key figures in 2015:
Budget: EUR 18.4 million (in payment appropriations).
Staff: 123 including officials, temporary and contract staff and seconded national experts.

2016/2161(DEC) - 07/02/2017 Supplementary non-legislative basic document
Having examined the revenue and expenditure accounts for the financial year 2015 and the balance sheet as at 31 December 2015 of the
European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop), as well as the Court of Auditors' report on the annual accounts of the
Centre for the financial year 2015, accompanied by the Centre's replies to the Court's observations, the Council recommended the European
Parliament to give a discharge to the Director of the Centre in respect of the implementation of the budget for the financial year 2015.
The Council welcomed the Court's opinion that, in all material respects, the Centre's annual accounts present fairly its financial position as at
31 December 2015 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions of the
Centre's Financial Regulation, and that the underlying transactions for 2015 are legal and regular in all material respects.
Nevertheless, a few observations were made:
financial programming: the Council noted that a high level of commitment appropriations was carried over to 2016. It encouraged the
Centre to continue improving its financial programming and monitoring of the budget implementation, in order to reduce the level of
commitments carried over to the following financial year to the minimum strictly necessary;
buildings: the Council noted the safety issues related to the construction of the Centre's building. It encouraged the Centre to complete
the necessary repair work without delay in order to re-establish the full availability of the Centre's facilities.

2016/2161(DEC) - 31/03/2017 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Inés AYALA SENDER (S&D, ES) on discharge in respect of the implementation of
the budget of the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (CEDEFOP) for the financial year 2015.
The committee called on the European Parliament to grant the Director of the Centre discharge in respect of the implementation of the
agencys budget for the financial year 2015.
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it had obtained reasonable assurance that the annual accounts of the Centre for the financial year
2015 were reliable and that the underlying transactions were legal and regular, Members called on Parliament to approve the closure of the
Centres accounts. They made, however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is granted,
in addition to the general recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU
agencies:
Centres financial statements: Members noted that the Centres final budget for the financial year 2015 was EUR 18 356 560,
representing an increase of 6.27 % compared to 2014. Its entire budget derives from the Union budget.
Performance: Members noted that the Centre cooperates closely with the European Training Foundation (ETF) and the European
Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound) and that that cooperation is formalised in cooperation
agreements between those agencies as well as in previously agreed annual work programmes. They acknowledged the fact that the
Centre actively contributed to a number of Union agencies performance development network activities, such as the working group on
activity-based budgeting, costing and management, cooperating with other Union agencies to collect good practices and developing a
toolkit for activity-based management in the Union agencies.
Members also made a series of observations regarding budget and financial management, commitment and carry-overs, transfers, internal
controls and audits, the prevention and management of conflicts of interests, procurement and recruitment procedures.
Members noted that the building provided to the Centre by the Greek authorities is constructed on an active fault line, which resulted in
structural damage to the building. They acknowledged the fact that the repair works on the building were finalised in December 2015. They
noted that the Centre is addressing various safety issues related to the construction of the building. They noted with satisfaction that the recent
crack meter readings conducted in April 2016 demonstrated the repair works as effective .
Members called on the Centre to assess whether the recurring problems with the current building call into question not only its economic
viability, but more importantly the safety and security of its personnel and whether relocation to a new building would be a more preferable
solution.

2016/2161(DEC) - 27/04/2017 Final act
PURPOSE: to grant discharge to the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (CEDEFOP) for the financial year 2015.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision (EU) 2017/1642 of the European Parliament on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of
the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training for the financial year 2015.
CONTENT: with the present decision, the European Parliament grants discharge to the Director of the European Centre for the Development
of Vocational Training for the implementation of the latters budget for the financial year 2015.
This decision is in line with the European Parliament's resolution adopted on 27 April 2017 and comprises a series of observations that form
an integral part of the discharge decision (please refer to the summary of the opinion of 27 April 2017).
Amongst Parliaments main observations in the resolution accompanying the discharge decision, the latter welcomed that the repairs works to

the Centre's building were finalised in December 2015.
Parliament appreciated the good quality of the Centre's research, analyses and technical advice through which it supports the development of
European lifelong learning and vocational education and training (VET) policies and contributes to their implementation in order to enable
workers to acquire good skills and to contribute to achieving the goals set in the Europe 2020 strategy.

2016/2161(DEC) - 27/04/2017 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament decided to grant discharge to the Director of the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training
(CEDEFOP) in respect of the implementation of the agencys budget for the financial year 2015.
The vote on the decision on discharge covers the closure of the accounts (in accordance with Annex IV, Article 5 (1) (a) to Parliaments Rules
of Procedure).
Noting that the Court of Auditors has stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the Centres annual accounts for the financial year
2015 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Parliament adopted by 510 votes to 110 with 8 abstentions, a
resolution containing a series of recommendations, which form an integral part of the decision on discharge and which add to the general
recommendations set out in the resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies.
These recommendations may be summarised as follows:
Centres financial statements: Parliament noted that the Centres final budget for the financial year 2015 was EUR 18 356 560,
representing an increase of 6.27 % compared to 2014. Its entire budget derives from the Union budget.
Performance: Parliament also noted that the Centre cooperates closely with the European Training Foundation (ETF) and the
European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound) and that that cooperation is formalised in
cooperation agreements between those agencies as well as in previously agreed annual work programmes. It acknowledged the fact
that the Centre actively contributed to a number of Union agencies performance development network activities, such as the working
group on activity-based budgeting, costing and management, cooperating with other Union agencies to collect good practices and
developing a toolkit for activity-based management in the Union agencies.
Parliament made a series of observations regarding budget and financial management, commitment and carry-overs, transfers, internal
controls and audits, the prevention and management of conflicts of interests, procurement and recruitment procedures.
Centres building: Parliament noted that the building provided to the Centre by the Greek authorities is constructed on an active fault line, which
resulted in structural damage to the building. It acknowledged the fact that the repair works on the building were finalised in December 2015. It
noted that the Centre is addressing various safety issues related to the construction of the building. It also noted with satisfaction that the
recent crack meter readings conducted in April 2016 demonstrated the repair works as effective .
Members called on the Centre to assess whether the recurring problems with the current building call into question not only its economic
viability, but more importantly the safety and security of its personnel and whether relocation to a new building would be a more preferable
solution.
Centres priority actions: lastly, Parliament welcomed the Centres focus on competences and skills which among other objectives helps to
better match vocational training to labour market demands and particularly welcomed the first European skills and jobs survey as well as the
launch of the new skills panorama.
