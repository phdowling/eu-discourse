2016/0218(COD) - 18/07/2016 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to lay down certain procedures for applying the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Union and the
European Atomic Energy Community, of the one part, and Kosovo of the other part.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: a Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community, of the
one part, and Kosovo of the other part, was signed on 27 October 2015 and entered into force on 1 April 2016. It is necessary to lay down

rules for the implementation of certain provisions of the Agreement, as well as the procedures for the adoption of detailed rules of
implementation.
CONTENT: the proposal lays down the rules and procedures for the adoption of detailed rules for the implementation of certain provisions of
the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community, of the one part, and
Kosovo, of the other part.
In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of the Agreement, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission.
Given that the implementing acts form part of the common commercial policy, the examination procedure should be used for their adoption.
The Commission should adopt such implementing acts immediately:
where the Agreement provides for the possibility, in exceptional and critical circumstances, to apply urgent measures necessary to
deal with the situation;
for measures concerning agricultural and fishery products, in cases of duly justified imperative grounds of urgency.
Under the Agreement, certain agricultural and fishery products originating in Kosovo may be imported into the Union at a reduced customs
duty, within the limits of tariff quotas. The proposal lays down provisions regulating the management and review of these tariff quotas in order
to allow for their thorough assessment.

2016/0218(COD) - 01/12/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on International Trade adopted the report by Adam SZEJNFELD (EPP, PL) on the proposal for a regulation of the European
Parliament and of the Council on certain procedures for applying the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Union
and the European Atomic Energy Community, of the one part, and Kosovo of the other part.
The committee recommended that the European Parliaments position adopted at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure
should amend the Commission proposal as follows.
The report stipulated that in accordance with the proposed Regulation, the examination procedure shall apply, in particular, for the adoption of
implementing acts relating to the common commercial policy. However, the advisory procedure shall apply in duly justified cases. Where the
Agreement provides for the possibility, in exceptional and critical circumstances, to apply forthwith measures necessary to deal with the
situation, the Commission should adopt such implementing acts immediately.
Members deleted Article 9 of the proposed Regulation which provided that for the purposes of implementing Article 34 of the Agreement, a
Union surveillance of imports of goods listed in Annex V of Protocol 3 to the Agreement shall be established.

2016/0218(COD) - 19/01/2017 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 519 to 83, with 69 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation of the European
Parliament and of the Council on certain procedures for applying the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Union
and the European Atomic Energy Community, of the one part, and Kosovo of the other part.
The proposed Regulation lays down the rules and procedures for the adoption of detailed rules for the implementation of certain provisions of
the Agreement, signed on 27 October 2015 and which entered into force on 1 April 2016.
The Agreement stipulated that certain agricultural and fishery products originating in Kosovo may be imported into the Union at a reduced
customs duty, within the limits of tariff quotas. The proposed Regulation lays down provisions regulating the management and review of these
tariff quotas in order to allow for their thorough assessment.
The European Parliaments position adopted at first reading, following the ordinary legislative procedure, amended the Commission proposal
so as to specify that, in accordance with the proposed Regulation, the examination procedure shall apply, in particular, for the adoption of
implementing acts relating to the common commercial policy. However, the advisory procedure shall apply in duly justified cases.
Where the Agreement provides for the possibility, in exceptional and critical circumstances, to apply forthwith measures necessary to deal with
the situation, the Commission should adopt such implementing acts immediately.

2016/0218(COD) - 15/02/2017 Final act
PURPOSE: to lay down certain procedures for applying the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Union and the
European Atomic Energy Community, of the one part, and Kosovo of the other part.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Regulation (EU) 2017/355 of the European Parliament and of the Council on certain procedures for applying the
Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community, of the one part, and
Kosovo of the other part.
CONTENT: the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community, of the
one part, and Kosovo of the other part, was signed on 27 October 2015. The Agreement entered into force on 1 April 2016.
This Regulation lays down rules for the implementation of certain provisions of the Agreement, as well as the procedures for the adoption of
detailed rules of implementation.
Implementing powers: in order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of the Agreement, the Regulation confers implementing
powers on the Commission.

The examination procedure will apply in particular to the adoption of implementing acts concerning the common commercial policy (e.g.
technical adaptations, safeguard clause, shortage clause). The advisory procedure may, however, apply in duly justified cases.
The Commission shall:
adopt immediately implementing acts where the Agreement provides for the possibility, in exceptional and critical circumstances, to
apply forthwith measures necessary to deal with the situation;
adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases relating to measures concerning agricultural and fishery
products, imperative grounds of urgency so require.
Tariff quota management: under the Agreement certain agricultural and fishery products originating in Kosovo may be imported into the Union
at a reduced customs duty, within the limits of tariff quotas.
The Regulation lays down provisions regulating the management and review of these tariff quotas in order to allow for their thorough
assessment.
Fraud or failure to provide administrative cooperation: where a Member State provides the Commission with information on possible fraud or a
lack of administrative cooperation, the Commission shall inform the European Parliament and the Council and report its findings to the
Stabilisation and Association Committee.
It may decide, by means of implementing acts, to temporarily suspend the preferential treatment of the products.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 23.3.2017. The Regulation shall apply from 1.4.2016.
