Summary

2016/2087(IMM) - 18/10/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Legal Affairs adopted the report by Tadeusz ZWIEFKA (EPP, PL), and recommended that the European Parliament waive
the immunity of Jane COLLINS (EFDD, RU).
Members recalled that the issue involves the defence of Jane Collins parliamentary privileges and immunities in relation to civil proceedings for
libel against her before the Queens Bench Division of the High Court in London.
Firstly, the request concerns the defence of the right of Members of the European Parliament, under Article 7 of the Protocol, not to be subject

to administrative or other restrictions on their free movement when travelling to or from the European Parliament. This part of the request
relates to the fact that Jane Collins has allegedly been prevented from travelling to parliamentary meetings by the scheduling of the court
proceedings being brought against her. However, bearing in mind the applicable jurisprudence ( Mote case), it appears that Article 7 of the
Protocol does not apply to restrictions arising out of legal proceedings. The request for defence of parliamentary privilege is therefore
inadmissible in respect of Article 7.
The request also concerns Article 8 of the Protocol, whereby Members are defended from any form of inquiry, detention or legal proceedings
in respect of opinions expressed or votes cast by them in the performance of their duties. In this respect, it appears that the claim of libel and
slander concerns accusations that Jane Collins made at a party conference. However, the committee stated that there is no direct, obvious
connection between the contested statements and Jane Collinss duties as a Member of the European Parliament. Furthermore, they do not
relate to her activity as a Member of the European Parliament or to the policies of the European Union, and were made in the context of
national political debate. It appears that the contested statements are, therefore, not covered by Article 8 of the Protocol.
Bearing these factors in mind, Members called on the European Parliament not to defend the privileges and immunities of Jane Collins.
