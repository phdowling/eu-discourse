Summary

2016/2911(RSP) - 06/10/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a resolution on Sudan.
The resolution was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ECR, GUE/NGL, Greens/EFA and EFDD groups.
Parliament recalled that the conflict in Darfur has been going on for 13 years and has claimed over 300 000 lives, with Sudanese Government
forces continuing to attack civilians, especially in Jebel Marra. This is a serious violation of international norms and also a war crime.
Members note that human rights groups have uncovered credible evidence of chemical weapon attacks on civilians by Sudanese Government
forces. They recalled that Sudan is a party to the Chemical Weapons Convention and called for an international investigation into these
allegations led by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
Parliament remained deeply concerned at the ongoing unlawful killings, abductions, and gender-based and sexual violence in the conflict
areas, notably in Darfur, Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile. It condemned the arbitrary arrest and detention of activists and the ongoing
detention of human rights defenders and journalists in Sudan and called on the African Union and the Sudanese Government to promptly
investigate all allegations of torture, ill treatment, and arbitrary detention. It also called on the Government of Sudan to issue an immediate
moratorium on all executions and to abolish the death penalty.
Humanitarian organisations and observance of human rights: Members expressed particular concern about the access restrictions still
imposed on international humanitarian agencies and demanded that the Sudanese Government make every effort possible to improve access
by international humanitarian agencies to all those seeking humanitarian aid.
The Sudanese Government was also called on to:
repeal any legal provisions that penalise or discriminate against individuals for their religious beliefs;
release detainees immediately and unconditionally and to halt arbitrary detentions forthwith, to drop all charges that stem from their
peaceful activities and to let NGOs, such as TRACK staff, conduct their work without fear of reprisals;
conduct an urgent review of its National Security Act, which allows the detention of suspects for up to four and half months without any
form of judicial review;
repeal the extensive immunities stipulated in Sudanese legislation;
publish the findings of the three state commissions of inquiry, and to publicly admit to the scale of the killings during the crackdown on
anti-austerity protesters in September 2013 and deliver justice to its victims.
International Criminal Court: Parliament called on the EU to move to impose targeted punitive sanctions against those responsible for
continued war crimes and non-cooperation with the International Criminal Court. It requested the EEAS to draw up a list of individuals for such
sanctions without further delay. At the same time, it called on the United Nations/African Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) to establish a
permanent presence inside Jebel Marra and on the EEAS and the Commission to closely monitor EU development assistance in Sudan in
order to prevent any direct or indirect support to local militias.
Improving dialogue with Sudan: lastly, Parliament called for the EU and its Member States to ensure that Parliament is kept fully informed of
the dialogue established under the Khartoum Process and that the activities funded through the EU Africa Trust Fund, particularly those aiming
to build the capacities of the Government of Sudan, are carried out in full compliance with existing agreements.
