2016/2055(INI) - 20/01/2017 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted an own-initiative report by Dennis de JONG (GUE/NGL, NL) on the role of whistle-blowers in
the protection of EUs financial interests.
The report stressed that whistle-blowers contribute greatly to increasing the democratic quality of, and the trust in, public institutions by making
them directly accountable to citizens and more transparent.
Legislative proposal: Members urged the Commission to immediately submit a legislative proposal establishing an effective and
comprehensive European whistle-blower protection programme which includes mechanisms for companies, public bodies and non-profit
organisations.
More specifically, the Commission is called upon to submit a legislative proposal before the end of this year protecting whistle-blowers as part
of the necessary measures in the fields of the prevention of and fight against fraud affecting the financial interests of the Union.
Member States which have not yet adopted the principles to protect whistle-blowers in their domestic law are called on to do so as soon as
possible
Whistle-blower protection: Members considered it necessary to foster an ethical culture helping to ensure that whistle-blowers will not suffer
retaliation or face internal conflicts. They stressed that the definition of whistle-blowing includes the protection of those who disclose
information with a reasonable belief that the information is true at the time it is disclosed, including those who make inaccurate disclosures in
honest error.
The Commission is invited to:
provide a clear legal framework that guarantees that those exposing illegal or unethical activities are protected from retaliation or
prosecution;
ensure that its proposal affords the same protection to investigative journalists as it does to whistle-blowers.
European body: the report stressed the need to establish an independent information-gathering, advisory and referral EU body, with offices in
Member States which are in a position to receive reports of irregularities. It should be provided with sufficient budgetary resources, adequate
competences and appropriate specialists, in order to help internal and external whistle-blowers in using the right channels to disclose their
information on possible irregularities affecting the financial interests of the Union, while protecting their confidentiality and offering needed
support and advice.
Special unit: Members requested the establishment a special unit with a reporting line as well as dedicated facilities (e.g. hotlines, websites,
contact points) within Parliament for receiving information from whistle-blowers relating to the financial interests of the Union, which will also
provide them with advice and help in protecting them against any possible retaliatory measure. They called for a website to be launched where
complaints can be submitted.
Single working protocol: the report called on the Commission, and on the European Public Prosecutors Office in so far as it is within its
mandate upon its establishment, to establish efficient channels of communication between the parties concerned, to likewise set up
procedures for receiving and protecting whistle-blowers who provide information on irregularities, and to establish a single working protocol for
whistle-blowers.

The Commission is also called upon to:
provide Parliament with any information received from whistle-blowers affecting the financial interests of the Union;
carry out a public consultation to seek the view of stakeholders on the reporting mechanisms and on the potential shortcomings of the
procedures at national level;
study best practices from whistle-blower programmes already in place in other countries around the world.
Lastly, the report called on Member States to refrain from criminalising the actions of whistle-blowers in disclosing information about illegal
activities or irregularities harmful to the EUs financial interests.

2016/2055(INI) - 14/02/2017 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 607 votes to 16, with 70 abstentions, a resolution on the role of whistle-blowers in the protection of EUs
financial interests.
Members stressed that whistle-blowers contribute greatly to increasing the democratic quality of, and the trust in, public institutions by making
them directly accountable to citizens and more transparent.
European protection programme: Parliament deplored the fact that the Commission has so far failed to submit any legislative proposals aimed
at establishing a minimum level of protection for European whistleblowers. It urged the Commission to immediately submit a legislative
proposal establishing an effective and comprehensive European whistle-blower protection programme which includes mechanisms for
companies, public bodies and non-profit organisations.
More specifically, the Commission is called upon to submit a legislative proposal before the end of this year protecting whistle-blowers as part
of the necessary measures in the fields of the prevention of and fight against fraud affecting the financial interests of the Union.
Member States which have not yet adopted the principles to protect whistle-blowers in their domestic law are called on to do so as soon as
possible.

interests of the Union, which will also provide them with advice and help in protecting them against any possible retaliatory measure. They

Single working protocol: the resolution called on the Commission to :
set up procedures for receiving and protecting whistleblowers who provide information on irregularities relating to the financial
interests of the Union, and to establish a single working protocol for whistleblowers;
provide Parliament with any information received from whistle-blowers affecting the financial interests of the Union and include a
chapter on their alerts and the follow-up to these in the annual activity reports;
carry out a public consultation to seek the view of stakeholders on the reporting mechanisms and on the potential shortcomings of the
procedures at national level;
study best practices from whistle-blower programmes already in place in other countries around the world.
Lastly, Parliament called on Member States to refrain from criminalising the actions of whistle-blowers in disclosing information about illegal
activities or irregularities harmful to the EUs financial interests.
