Commission response to text adopted in plenary

SP(2016)269

22/06/2016

2016/2515(RSP) - 25/02/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 449 votes to 36, with 78 abstentions, a resolution on the humanitarian situation in Yemen.
The text was adopted in plenary by the EPP, S&D, ALDE, GUE/NGL, Greems/EFA and EFDD groups.
Parliament recalled that the Saudi-led military intervention in Yemen, requested by Yemens President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, including the
use of internationally banned cluster bombs, has led to a disastrous humanitarian situation that affects the population across the country. It has
serious implications for the region and constitutes a threat to international peace and security. Since the start of the conflict at least 5 979
people have been killed, almost half of them civilians, and 28 208 injured.
According to the members, the current crisis in Yemen is the result of the pre-existing domestic conflict, the intensification of airstrikes by the
Saudi-led coalition. They are concerned about the naval blockade it has imposed on Yemen.
This situation has created instability which has been exploited by terrorist and extremist organisations such as ISIS/Daesh and AQAP, as well
as destabilising and violent actions taken by the Houthis, who are supported by Iran.
Humanitarian action: Parliament stressed the need for coordinated humanitarian action under UN leadership, and urged all parties to allow the
entry and delivery of urgently needed food, medicine, fuel and other necessary assistance through UN and international humanitarian
channels in order to address the urgent needs of civilians affected by the crisis. Parliament called for a humanitarian pause to allow life-saving
assistance to reach the Yemeni people as a matter of urgency. In this regard, international humanitarian law and international human rights
law should be complied with.
It reminded all parties that hospitals and medical personnel are explicitly protected under international humanitarian law and that the deliberate
targeting of civilians and civilian infrastructure amounts to a war crime.
In parallel, Parliament called on the VP/HR to launch an initiative aimed at imposing an EU arms embargo against Saudi Arabia, given the
serious allegations of breaches of international humanitarian law by Saudi Arabia in Yemen.
Negotiated solution: Members are convinced that Saudi Arabia and Iran are instrumental in resolving the crisis, and urged both sides to work
pragmatically and in good faith to end the fighting in Yemen. According to the Parliament, only a political, inclusive and negotiated solution to
the conflict can restore peace and preserve the unity, sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Yemen. It urged all parties to
engage, in good faith and without preconditions, in a new round of UN-led peace negotiations as soon as possible.
Lastly, it supported the efforts of the UN Special Envoy, Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, to hold UN-facilitated peace talks.
