Summary

PURPOSE: to designate 2018 as the European Year of Cultural Heritage.
PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: the ideals, principles and values embedded in the European cultural heritage constitute a shared source of remembrance,
understanding, identity, dialogue, cohesion and creativity for Europe.
Since the adoption of the European Agenda for Culture in 2007, cultural heritage has been a priority under successive Council Work Plans for
Culture, including the current plan for the period 2015-2018.
The Council, in its conclusions on participatory governance of cultural heritage of 25 November 2014, invited the Commission to consider
presenting a proposal for a European Year of Cultural Heritage. The European Parliament, in its resolution recommended designating,
preferably for 2018, a European Year of Cultural Heritage.24
The heritage sector in Europe is facing many challenges. These include: decreasing public budgets; declining participation in traditional
cultural activities; increasing environmental and physical pressures on heritage sites; transforming value chains and expectations as a result of
the digital shift; and the illegal trafficking of cultural artefacts.
Against this backdrop, the main objective is to raise awareness of the challenges and opportunities and highlight the role of the EU in
promoting shared solutions.
CONTENT: it is proposed to designate the year 2018 as the European Year of Cultural Heritage.
Objectives: the European Year shall:
contribute to promoting the role of European cultural heritage as a pivotal component of cultural diversity and intercultural dialogue. It
should highlight the best means to ensure its conservation and safeguarding and its enjoyment by a wider and more diversified public.
This includes through audience development measures and heritage education, in full respect of the competences of the Member
States, thereby promoting social inclusion and integration;
enhance the contribution of European cultural heritage to the economy and the society, through its direct and indirect economic
potential. This includes the capacity to underpin the cultural and creative industries and inspire creation and innovation, promote
sustainable tourism, enhance social cohesion and generate long-term employment;
contribute to promoting cultural heritage as an important element of the EUs international dimension, building on the interest in partner
countries for Europes heritage and expertise. Heritage plays a major role in several programmes in the area of external relations,
mainly but not exclusively in the Middle East. The promotion of the value of cultural heritage is also a response to the deliberate
destruction of cultural treasures in conflict zone.
Specific objectives are also laid down.
Measures: the proposal presents measures which will include information and promotion campaigns, events and initiatives at European,
national, regional and local levels:
conferences, events and initiatives to promote debate and raise awareness of the importance and value of cultural heritage and to
facilitate engagement with citizens and stakeholders;
information, education and awareness-raising campaigns to convey values such as diversity and intercultural dialogue using evidence
from Europes rich heritage and to stimulate the general publics contribution in heritage protection and management and more
generally in achieving the objectives of the European Year;
sharing of experience and good practices of national, regional and local administrations, and other organisations, to disseminate
information about cultural heritage;
undertaking studies and research and innovation activities and the dissemination of their results on European or national scale.
Coordination at national level: each Member State shall appoint a national coordinator responsible for organising its participation in the
European Year. The coordinator shall ensure the coordination of relevant activities at national level.
Coordination at Union level: the Commission shall convene meetings of the national coordinators in order to coordinate the running of the
European Year and to exchange information regarding its implementation at national and European level.
International cooperation: the Commission shall cooperate with competent international organisations, in particular with UNESCO and the
Council of Europe, while ensuring the visibility of the EUs participation.
Funding: co-financing at European level of activities in support of the European Year shall be in accordance with the applicable rules, and
within the existing possibilities for priority setting on an annual or multiannual basis, to existing programmes, in particular the Creative Europe
programme. Where appropriate, other programmes and policies, within their existing legal and financial provisions, may also support the
European Year.
Monitoring and evaluation: by 31 December 2019, the Commission shall submit a report to the European Parliament, the Council on the
implementation, results and overall assessment of the initiatives provided for in this Decision.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: no additional funding is sought for the European Year. This initiative does not require additional EU budget.
The flexibility for setting priorities on an annual or multiannual basis in the relevant programmes is sufficient to envisage an awareness-raising
campaign on a scale similar to previous European Years.

2016/0259(COD) - 17/11/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Culture and Education adopted the report by Mircea DIACONU (ADLE, RO) on the proposal for a decision of the European

Parliament and of the Council on a European Year of Cultural Heritage.
The committee recommended that the European Parliaments position adopted at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure
should amend the Commission proposal as follows:
Objective of the European Year: the main objective of the European Year is the celebration of European cultural heritage as a shared
resource, resulting from a centuries-old history and the intertwining of the Member States as well as European peoples.
It shall enhance the contribution of European cultural heritage to the economy and the society, through its direct and indirect economic
potential. This includes the capacity to underpin the cultural and creative industries, small and medium sized enterprises as well as small-scale
and large-scale projects.
Working group: in the first quarter of 2017, the Commission shall set up a working group involving the European Parliament and relevant
stakeholders. By 31 December 2017, the working group shall present a work plan detailing the activities foreseen for 2018, including the
corresponding budgetary allocations, as well as the visual identity for the European Year. A number of flagship initiatives shall be identified by
the working group and implemented in the framework of the European Year.
Coordination at Member State level: the competent authorities from the Member States shall work together with the Union institutions in order
to guarantee the proper implementation of the European Year and to multiply its impact through additional activities, community involvement
and dissemination actions.
The Commission shall convene meetings of the coordinators at Member State level and representatives of the European Parliament in order to
coordinate the running of the European Year and to exchange information regarding its implementation at Member State and Union level. The
coordination at Union level of the European Year shall have a transversal approach within the Commission ensuring the participation of all
relevant Directorates General under the coordination of the Directorate General for Education and Culture with a view to creating synergies
between the various Union programmes and initiatives funding projects in the field of cultural heritage, and to better disseminating information
on the European Year.
Involvement of civil society: the structure of the European Year shall allow for the active participation of professional organisations operating in
the field of cultural heritage, of existing transnational cultural networks and of interested NGOs and cultural associations and, in particular, of
youth organisations.
Budget: a dedicated article within the general budget of the Union shall be established for the European Year. This Article shall include the
funds foreseen for the preparation of the European Year, its implementation and actions contributing to the European Year's long-term
sustainability. The overall funding in this Article shall be EUR 15 million. The indicative breakdown by year shall be as follows:
EUR 1 million in 2017,
EUR 13 million in 2018,
EUR 1 million in 2019.
Activities financed: the activities organised in the framework of the European Year may be co-financed through dedicated grants from national,
regional and local authorities in the Member States and through flexible funding mechanisms such as public-private partnerships or
crowdfunding.
