2016/0819(CNS) - 13/12/2016 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to authorise Slovakia, Portugal, Latvia, Lithuania, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Cyprus, Poland, Sweden, Malta and Belgium
to continue to be entitled to receive and supply personal data for the purpose of automated searching and comparison of DNA data.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Implementing Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to
follow its opinion.
BACKGROUND: Council Decision 2008/615/JHA on the stepping up of cross-border cooperation, particularly in combating terrorism and
cross-border crime, confers upon the Council implementing powers with a view to adopting measures necessary to implement that Decision, in
particular as regards the receipt and supply of personal data provided for under that Decision.
The supply of personal data provided for under that Decision may not take place until the general provisions on data protection have been
implemented in the national law of the territories of the Member States involved in such supply.
Council Decision 2008/616/JHA provides that the verification that the condition with respect to automated data exchange has been met is to be
done on the basis of an evaluation report based on a questionnaire, an evaluation visit and a pilot run.
The overall evaluation reports, summarising the results of the questionnaire, the evaluation visit and the pilot run concerning DNA data in
Slovakia, Portugal, Latvia, Lithuania, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Cyprus, Poland, Sweden, Malta and Belgium have been presented to
the Council.
On the basis of these evaluation reports, Decisions 2010/689/EU, 2011/472/EU, 2011/715/EU, 2011/887/EU, 2012/58/EU, 2012/299/EU,
2012/445/EU, 2012/673/EU, 2013/3/EU, 2013/148/EU, 2013/152/EU and 2014/410/EU authorised Slovakia, Portugal, Latvia, Lithuania, Czech
Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Cyprus, Poland, Sweden, Malta and Belgium to continue to be entitled to receive and supply personal data for the
purpose of automated searching and comparison of DNA data.
In its judgment of 22 September, the Court of Justice annulled the above-mentioned Decisions on the basis that they are vitiated by a
procedural defect. With a view to ensuring the legal certainty of the receipt and supply of personal data with regard to the Member States
concerned, those Decisions should be replaced by this present draft Decision.
CONTENT: the proposed Council implementing Decision seeks, for the purpose of automated searching and comparison of DNA data, to
authorise Slovakia, Portugal, Latvia, Lithuania, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Cyprus, Poland, Sweden, Malta and Belgium to continue to
be entitled to receive and supply personal data pursuant to Decision 2008/615/JHA.
Decisions 2010/689/EU, 2011/472/EU, 2011/715/EU, 2011/887/EU, 2012/58/EU, 2012/299/EU, 2012/445/EU, 2012/673/EU, 2013/3/EU,
2013/148/EU, 2013/152/EU and 2014/410/EU cease to produce effects as from the date of entry into force of this Decision, without prejudice

to the validity of automated data exchange carried out pursuant to those Decisions by the Member States.
Member States which obtained personal data pursuant to the Decisions shall continue to be entitled to further process those data at national
level or between Member States for the purposes laid down in Decision 2008/615/JHA.
The United Kingdom and Ireland shall participate in the adoption of the proposed Decision.

2016/0819(CNS) - 28/03/2017 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs adopted, following the consultation procedure, the report by Judith SARGENTINI
(Greens/EFA, NL) on the draft Council implementing decision on the automated data exchange with regard to DNA data in Slovakia, Portugal,
Latvia, Lithuania, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Cyprus, Poland, Sweden, Malta and Belgium and replacing Decisions 2010/689/EU,
2011/472/EU, 2011/715/EU, 2011/887/EU, 2012/58/EU, 2012/299/EU, 2012/445/EU, 2012/673/EU, 2013/3/EU, 2013/148/EU, 2013/152/EU
and 2014/410/EU.
The committee recommended the European Parliament to approve the Council draft.
The proposed Council implementing Decision seeks, for the purpose of automated searching and comparison of DNA data, to authorise
Slovakia, Portugal, Latvia, Lithuania, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Cyprus, Poland, Sweden, Malta and Belgium to continue to be
entitled to receive and supply personal data pursuant to Decision 2008/615/JHA on the stepping up of cross-border cooperation, particularly in
combating terrorism and cross-border crime.
In the explanatory memorandum accompanying the report, it is recalled that Parliament was consulted by the Council pursuant to Article 39(1)
of the Treaty on European Union, as amended by the Treaty of Amsterdam , and Article 9 of Protocol No 36 on transitional provisions.
In accordance with Article 39(1) of the ex-Treaty on European Union, which the Court of Justice has ruled that it is still applicable, the Council
may lay down a time limit for the European Parliament to deliver its opinion and in the absence of an opinion within that time limit, the Council
may act.
The rapporteur considered that CJEU case law does not allow adequate parliamentary control. It regretted that the Commission has still not
submitted proposals to replace the instruments adopted under the former third pillar, in particular one on the replacement of the 'Pr√ºm
Decision' (Council Decision 2008/616/JHA). Such an act should be based on Article 87(2)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European
Union, thus enabling Parliament to take part in drafting this legislation in the ordinary legislative procedure.

2016/0819(CNS) - 05/04/2017 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 595 votes to 78, with 22 abstentions, following the consultation procedure, a legislative resolution on the
draft Council implementing decision on the automated data exchange with regard to DNA data in Slovakia, Portugal, Latvia, Lithuania, Czech
Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Cyprus, Poland, Sweden, Malta and Belgium and replacing Decisions 2010/689/EU, 2011/472/EU, 2011/715/EU,
2011/887/EU, 2012/58/EU, 2012/299/EU, 2012/445/EU, 2012/673/EU, 2013/3/EU, 2013/148/EU, 2013/152/EU and 2014/410/EU.
Parliament was consulted by the Council in accordance with Article 39(1) of the Treaty on European Union, as amended by the Treaty of
Amsterdam, and Article 9 of Protocol No 36 on transitional provisions.
In line with the recommendation made by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, Parliament approved the Council draft.

2016/0819(CNS) - 18/05/2017 Final act
PURPOSE: to authorise Slovakia, Portugal, Latvia, Lithuania, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Cyprus, Poland, Sweden, Malta and Belgium
to continue to receive and supply of personal data for the purpose of automated searching and comparison of DNA.
NON LEGISLATIVE ACT: Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2017/945 on the automated data exchange with regard to DNA data in
Slovakia, Portugal, Latvia, Lithuania, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Cyprus, Poland, Sweden, Malta and Belgium and replacing Decisions
2010/689/EU, 2011/472/EU, 2011/715/EU, 2011/887/EU, 2012/58/EU, 2012/299/EU, 2012/445/EU, 2012/673/EU, 2013/3/EU, 2013/148/EU,
2013/152/EU and 2014/410/EU
CONTENT: through this Council Implementing Decision, Slovakia, Portugal, Latvia, Lithuania, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Cyprus,
Poland, Sweden, Malta and Belgium remain authorised to continue to receive and supply personal data in accordance with Decision
2008/615/JAI for the purpose of automated searching and comparison of DNA data.
To recall, Council Decision 2008/615/JAI on the stepping up of cross-border cooperation, particularly in combating terrorism and cross-border
crime, provides that the supply of personal data may not take place until the Member States involved in such supply have implemented in
national law the general provisions on data protection set out in that Decision.
An overall evaluation report, summarising the results of the questionnaire, the evaluation visit and the pilot run concerning the Member States
concerned has been presented to the Council.
On the basis of these evaluation reports, Decisions 2010/689/EU, 2011/472/EU, 2011/715/EU, 2011/887/EU, 2012/58/EU, 2012/299/EU,
2012/445/EU, 2012/673/EU, 2013/3/EU, 2013/148/EU, 2013/152/EU and 2014/410/EU authorised Slovakia, Portugal, Latvia, Lithuania, Czech
Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Cyprus, Poland, Sweden, Malta and Belgium to continue to be entitled to receive and supply personal data for the
purpose of automated searching and comparison of DNA data.
In its judgment of 22 September, the Court of Justice annulled the above-mentioned Decisions on the basis that they are vitiated by a
procedural defect.

With a view to ensuring the legal certainty of the receipt and supply of personal data, this Decision replaces the Decisions annulled by the
Court.
The Member States that obtained personal data pursuant to these Decision are entitled to further process those data at national level or
between Member States.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 3.6.2017. From that date, Decisions 2010/689/EU, 2011/472/EU, 2011/715/EU, 2011/887/EU, 2012/58/EU,
2012/299/EU, 2012/445/EU, 2012/673/EU, 2013/3/EU, 2013/148/EU, 2013/152/EU and 2014/410/EU will cease to have effect.
