Summary

2016/0801(CNS) - 30/11/2015 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to authorise the European Police Office (Europol) to conclude the Agreement on Strategic Cooperation between Brazil and
Europol.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Implementing Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to
follow its opinion.
BACKGROUND : pursuant to Decision 2009/371/JHA establishing the European Police Office (Europol) and Decision 2009/934/JHA adopting
the implementing rules governing Europol's relations with partners, Europol is to conclude agreements with the third States which have been
put on the list determined by Decision 2009/935/JHA.
Such agreements have the objective of supporting and strengthening action by the competent authorities of the Member States and their
mutual cooperation in preventing and combating organised crime, terrorism and other forms of serious crime affecting two or more Member
States, and may concern the exchange of operational, strategic or technical information, including personal data and classified information.
Brazil is included in the list determined by Decision 2009/935/JHA.
In order to increase effectiveness in preventing and combating serious forms of crime, Europol has initiated the procedure for the conclusion of
an Agreement on Strategic Cooperation between Brazil and Europol (Strategic Agreement).
Strategic Agreements involve the exchange of information excluding personal data. Europol may conclude them only after approval by the
Council, the latter having previously consulted the Management Board of Europol. The Management Board approved the Strategic Agreement
on 6-7 October 2015.
The conditions for triggering the exercise of implementing powers by the Council pursuant to Decisions 2009/371/JHA, 2009/934/JHA and
2009/935/JHA have been met
CONTENT: by the draft implementing Decision, Europol is authorised to conclude the Agreement on Strategic Cooperation between Brazil and
Europol.
The terms of the cooperation governed by the Strategic Agreement provide for the exchange of information, which may include specialist
knowledge, general situation reports, results of strategic analysis, information on criminal investigation procedures and information on
crime-prevention methods, participation in training activities, and the provision of advice and support in individual criminal investigations.
The Strategic Agreement contains no provision relating to the exchange of personal data.
Denmark, the United Kingdom and Ireland are taking part in the adoption and application of the Decision.

2016/0801(CNS) - 30/03/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs adopted, in the framework of Parliaments consultation procedure, the report by
Claude MORAES (S&D, UK) on the draft Council implementing decision approving the conclusion by the European Police Office (Europol) of
the Agreement on Strategic Cooperation between the Federative Republic of Brazil and Europol.
The committee proposed that the European Parliament should approve the Council draft. It called on the Commission to:
assess, after the entry into force of the new Europol Regulation, the provisions contained in the cooperation agreement;
inform Parliament and the Council of the outcome of this assessment and, if appropriate, to submit a recommendation for an
authorisation to open international renegotiation of the agreement.
Members supported the conclusion of this strategic cooperation agreement with Brazil, since it would aid and reinforce the fight against
organised crime and would contribute to enhancing international law enforcement co-operation.

According to Europol, Brazil is increasingly relevant in the fight against organized crime, such as facilitated illegal immigration and trafficking in
human beings, drug related crimes and credit card fraud, as well as other cybercrime related activities. Furthermore, the 2016 Olympic Games
are expected, as is the case with any other major sports event, to lead to increased criminal activities. Lastly, Brazil is also of particular interest
in the area of counter-terrorism and asset recovery.

2016/0801(CNS) - 12/04/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 516 votes to 68, with 126 abstentions, in the framework of Parliaments consultation procedure, a
legislative resolution on the draft Council implementing decision approving the conclusion by the European Police Office (Europol) of the
Agreement on Strategic Cooperation between the Federative Republic of Brazil and Europol.
Parliament approved the Council draft. It called on the Commission to:
·

assess, after the entry into force of the new Europol Regulation, the provisions contained in the cooperation agreement;

·

inform Parliament and the Council of the outcome of this assessment and, if appropriate, to submit a recommendation for an
authorisation to open international renegotiation of the agreement.
