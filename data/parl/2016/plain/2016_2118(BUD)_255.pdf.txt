2016/2118(BUD) - 30/06/2016 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: to fully mobilise the Contingency Margin to provide EUR 1 164.4 million in commitment appropriations over and above the
commitment ceiling of heading 3 (Security and Citizenship) of the multiannual financial framework.
PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
CONTENT: Article 13 of Council Regulation (EU, EURATOM) No 1311/2013 has established a Contingency Margin of up to 0,03 % of the
Gross National Income of the Union.
In the technical adjustment of the MFF for 2017, based on Article 6 of the MFF Regulation, the absolute amount of the Contingency Margin for
the year 2017 is set at EUR 4 496.8 million.
After having examined all possibilities for financing additional and unforeseen commitment needs, the Commission proposes to mobilise the
Contingency Margin for 2017 for an amount of EUR 1 164.4 million so as to complement the commitment appropriations related to expenditure

in heading 3 in the general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2017, over and above the commitment ceiling of EUR 2 578
million in current prices.
In accordance with point 14 of the Interinstitutional Agreement between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on
budgetary discipline, on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management, the Commission has carried out an analysis of
the possibility to reallocate significant amounts within the existing budget. It proposes to offset the reinforcement of the expenditure ceiling of
heading 3 as follows:
EUR 650 million against the unallocated margin available under the expenditure ceiling of heading 2;
EUR 514.4 million against the unallocated margin available in heading 5 in 2017.
It should be noted that this proposal is accompanied by a Commission proposal to mobilise in full the amount of the Flexibility Instrument
available for 2017 (EUR 530 million), also for heading 3.
Contingency margin as the last resort instrument: in the 2017 Draft Budget (DB), the Commission proposes to fully use the unallocated margin
under the commitment ceiling of heading 3 after having examined all possibilities for redeployment within the heading.
Given the full mobilisation of the flexibility instrument in the DB 2017 (EUR 530 million), the mobilisation of the Contingency Margin for 2017 at
a level of EUR 1 164.4 million is therefore the only available instrument to address the gap between the level of the expenditure ceiling of
heading 3 in 2017 and the additional unforeseen needs estimated for 2017.
Although the migration, refugee and security crisis began in 2015, its impact and consequences are still evolving on a day-to-day basis.
Political decisions in third countries about the acceptance of refugees on their territory and the opening and closure of borders make it very
hard to foresee the long-term evolution in this field.
Offsetting the contingency margin against the MFF ceilings: Article 13(3) of the MFF Regulation requires that amounts made available through
the mobilisation of the Contingency Margin shall be fully offset against the margins for the current or future financial years. Therefore the
amounts offset shall not be further mobilised in the context of the MFF so that the total ceilings of commitment and payment appropriations laid
down in the MFF for the current and future financial years shall not be exceeded. Consequently, the mobilisation of the Contingency Margin for
commitment appropriations in 2017 under heading 3 and the related offsetting have to respect the total commitment ceiling for the years 2017
to 2020.
As sufficient margins are available under the 2017 expenditure ceilings of heading 2 and 5, the Commission proposes to make the offsetting
fully in 2017 in order not to prejudge the needs in commitment appropriations of the years 2018-2020.
The amount offset in heading 2 will be EUR 650 million, leaving a margin of EUR 639.3 million in 2017. The rest of the offsetting (EUR 514.4
million) is made against the margin of heading 5, leaving a margin of EUR 81.9 million in 2017.
The overall commitment ceiling for 2017 and for the whole MFF will remain unchanged.
In order to minimise the time taken to mobilise the Contingency margin, it is proposed that the Decision should apply from 1 January 2017.

2016/2118(BUD) - 17/10/2016 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: to mobilise the contingency margin in 2017.
PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
CONTENT: Article 13 of Council Regulation No 1311/2013 laying down the multiannual financial framework for the years 2014-2020 allows for
the mobilisation of the Contingency Margin of up to 0.03 % of Gross National Income for the EU-28 to react to unforeseen circumstances as a
last resort instrument.
In the technical adjustment of the MFF for 2017, based on Article 6 of the MFF Regulation, the absolute amount of the Contingency Margin for
the year 2017 is set at EUR 4 496,8 million.
After having examined all possibilities for financing additional and unforeseen commitment needs, the Commission proposes to mobilise the
Contingency Margin for 2017 for an amount of EUR 2 150,6 million so as to complement the commitment appropriations related to expenditure
in:
headings 3 Security and Citizenship: EUR 2 578 million;
heading 4 Global Europe: EUR 9 432 million in current prices.
The Commission carried out an analysis of the possibility to reallocate significant amounts within the existing budget and proposed in this
regard to offset the reinforcement of the expenditure ceiling of headings 3 and 4 as follows:
2017: EUR 850 million against the unallocated margin available under the expenditure ceiling of heading 2 Sustainable Growth:
Natural Resources and EUR 514.4 million against the unallocated margin available in heading 5 Administration;
2018: EUR 570 million against the unallocated margin available in heading 5 Administration;
2019: EUR 216.2 million against the unallocated margin available in heading 5 Administration.
This proposal includes an amount of EUR 1 164,4 million for which the Commission had already made a proposal to mobilise the Contingency
Margin for heading 3 which accompanied the initial draft budget 2017, and which is now repealed and replaced by the present proposal.
This proposal has been preceded by a Commission proposal to mobilise in full the amount of the Flexibility Instrument available for 2017 (EUR
530 million), also for heading 3.
Margin as the last resort: it is recalled that Article 13(1) of the MFF Regulation defines the Contingency Margin as a last resort instrument to
react to unforeseen circumstances.
Given the full mobilisation of the flexibility instrument in the DB 2017 (EUR 530 million), the mobilisation of the Contingency Margin for 2017 at

a level of EUR 2 150,6 million is therefore the only available instrument to address the gap between the level of the expenditure ceiling of
headings 3 and 4 in 2017 and the additional unforeseen needs estimated for 2017.

2016/2118(BUD) - 25/11/2016 Budgetary report tabled for plenary, 1st reading
The Committee on Budgets adopted the report by Jens GEIER (S&D, DE) on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of
the Council on the mobilisation of the Contingency Margin in 2017.
Having examined all possibilities for financing additional and unforeseen commitment needs, the Commission proposed in its Draft Budget to
mobilise the Contingency Margin for an amount of EUR 1 164.4 million so as to complement the commitment appropriations related to
expenditure in heading 3 in the general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2017, over and above the commitment ceiling of
EUR 2 578 million in current prices.
Additional financial needs are likely to arise in 2017, in relation to the internal security crises and the current humanitarian, migratory and
refugee challenges. Members acknowledged that these needs could significantly exceed the funding available under heading 3.
They recalled that no more margin is available under the ceiling of heading 3.
Therefore, Members requested the Commission to clarify if and how additional funds could be possibly mobilised using the Contingency
Margin to respond to possible additional financial needs for heading 3 during the course of 2017.
The Commission revised this mobilisation proposal in the framework of Amending Letter 1/2017 so as to cover also expenditure under heading
4.
The Conciliation Committee convened for the 2016 budget agreed to the mobilisation of the Contingency margin at a level of EUR 1 906.2
million for heading 3 and heading 4 and to offset EUR 575 million against the unallocated margin under heading 2 Sustainable Growth: Natural
Resources in 2017, EUR 507.3 million in 2017, EUR 570 million in 2018 and EUR 253.9 million in 2019 against the unallocated margins under
heading 5 Administration.
Members called on the European Parliament to approve the decision annexed to this resolution.

2016/2118(BUD) - 01/12/2016 Budgetary text adopted by Parliament
The European Parliament adopted by 508 votes to 89, with 45 abstentions, a resolution on the proposal for a decision of the European
Parliament and of the Council on the mobilisation of the Contingency Margin in 2017.
Having examined all possibilities for financing additional and unforeseen commitment needs, the Commission proposed in its Draft Budget to
mobilise the Contingency Margin for an amount of EUR 1 164.4 million so as to complement the commitment appropriations related to
expenditure in heading 3 in the general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2017, over and above the commitment ceiling of
EUR 2 578 million in current prices.
Parliament noted that additional financial needs are likely to arise in 2017, in relation to the internal security crises and the current
humanitarian, migratory and refugee challenges. It acknowledged that these needs could significantly exceed the funding available under
heading 3.
It recalled that no more margin is available under the ceiling of heading 3 . Therefore, it called on the Commission to clarify if and how
additional funds could be possibly mobilised using the Contingency Margin to respond to possible additional financial needs for heading 3
during the course of 2017.
The Commission revised this mobilisation proposal in the framework of Amending Letter 1/2017 so as to cover also expenditure under heading
4.
The Conciliation Committee convened for the 2016 budget agreed to the mobilisation of the Contingency margin at a level of EUR 1 906.2
million for heading 3 and heading 4 and to offset EUR 575 million against the unallocated margin under heading 2 Sustainable Growth: Natural
Resources in 2017, EUR 507.3 million in 2017, EUR 570 million in 2018 and EUR 253.9 million in 2019 against the unallocated margins under
heading 5 Administration.
Parliament approved the decision annexed to this resolution.

2016/2118(BUD) - 14/12/2016 Final act
PURPOSE: to mobilise the contingency margin in 2017.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision (EU) 2017/344 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the mobilisation of the Contingency
Margin in 2017.
CONTENT: Article 13 of Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 has established a Contingency Margin of up to 0.03 % of the Gross
National Income of the Union.
In accordance with that Regulation, the Commission has calculated the absolute amount of the Contingency Margin for 2017.
After having examined all other financial possibilities to react to unforeseen circumstances within the 2017 commitment ceilings:
for heading 3 (Security and citizenship);
for heading 4 (Global Europe) of the multiannual financial framework,

and having regard to the mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument for the full amount of EUR 530 million available in 2017, it appears necessary
to mobilise the contingency margin to address the needs stemming from the migration, refugee and security crisis , by increasing the
commitment appropriations in the general budget of the Union for the financial year 2017, over and above the ceilings of headings 3 and 4 of
the multiannual financial framework.
The European Parliament and the Council therefore decided to mobilise the contingency margin under the 2017 budget in order to provide
EUR 1 176 030 960 in commitment appropriations over and above the commitment ceiling of heading 3 (Security and citizenship) and of EUR
730 120 000 in commitment appropriations over and above the commitment ceiling of heading 4 (Global Europe) of the multiannual financial
framework.
The total amount of EUR 1 906 150 960 in commitment appropriations shall be offset against the margins under the commitment ceilings for
the years 2017 to 2019 of the following headings of the multiannual financial framework:
2017:
heading 2 (Sustainable Growth Natural Resources): EUR 575 000 000;
heading 5 (Administration): EUR 507 268 804;
2018:
heading 5 (Administration): EUR 570 000 000;
2019:
heading 5 (Administration): EUR 253 882 156.
Margin as the last resort: it is recalled that Article 13(1) of the MFF Regulation defines the contingency margin as a last resort instrument to
react to unforeseen circumstances.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: the Decision shall enter into force on 28.2.2017. It shall apply from 1.1.2017.
