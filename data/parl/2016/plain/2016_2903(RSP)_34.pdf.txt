Summary

2016/2903(RSP) - 15/02/2017 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a resolution on low-risk pesticides of biological origin tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public
Health and Food Safety.
Present situation: Members stated that the use of conventional plant protection products is increasingly subject to public debate, due to the
potential risks they pose to human health, animals and the environment. In a certain percentage of agricultural products of plant or animal
origin, it is still possible to find undesirable pesticide residues above the maximum levels for pesticide.
Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of plant protection products on the
market allows active substances to be approved as low-risk active substances. At present, only seven active substances classified as low-risk
whereof six are active substances of biological origin are approved in the Union.
Moreover, products containing low-risk active substances of biological origin have been refused authorisation by a certain number of Member
States owing to their perceived lower efficacy as compared to synthetic chemical pesticides, without any regard to the ongoing innovation in
the sector for low-risk pesticides of biological origin, without considering the resource efficiency benefits for organic farming, and without
considering agricultural, health and environmental costs of certain other plant protection products.
Revised legislation: Parliament called on the Commission to submit, before the end of 2018, a specific legislative proposal amending
Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, with a view to establishing a fast-track evaluation, authorisation and registration process for low-risk pesticides
of biological origin.
Immediate action: Parliament called for the swift adoption of the draft regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 as regards the
criteria for the approval of low-risk active substances that the Commission submitted to the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and
Feed (PAFF Committee).
They also called on the Commission and the Member States to accelerate the evaluation, authorisation, registration and monitoring of the use
of low-risk plant protection products of biological origin while maintaining risk assessment at a high level.
Member States are called upon to: (i) include the use of low-risk pesticides of biological origin in their national action plans on the protection of
the environment and of human health; (ii) exchange information and good practices deriving from the results of research into pest control,
enabling the provision of alternative solutions that are viable in environmental, health and economic terms.
