2016/2233(BUD) - 14/09/2016 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: to amend Decision (EU) 2015/435 on the mobilisation of the Contingency Margin in order to react to unforeseen circumstances in
2014.
CONTENT: by Decision (EU) 2015/4355, the European Parliament and the Council mobilised the Contingency Margin in 2014 to allow the
financing over and above the payment ceiling of EUR 3 168 233 715.
An amount of EUR 350 million in payment appropriations was included in the mobilisation of the Contingency Margin pending an agreement
on the treatment of payments for special instruments.
It was decided to offset an amount of EUR 2 818 233 715 over the period 2018-2020 and to invite the Commission to present in a timely
manner a proposal concerning the remaining amount of EUR 350 million.
Payment appropriations related to the use of the special instruments are entered in the budget over and above the relevant payment ceilings
of the multiannual financial framework. As a consequence the mobilisation of the Contingency Margin in 2014 is only necessary for a total
amount of EUR 2 818 233 715 in payment appropriations, with no need to include and offset the additional amount of EUR 350 million.
Pressure on payments from 2018-2020: according to the medium-term payment forecast presented in the context of the Mid-Term Review,
pressure on the annual payment ceilings in the years 2018-2020 is to be expected.
The draft budget for the year 2017 shows a margin below the payment ceiling of EUR 9.6 billion, allowing for the offsetting of the full amount
mobilised in 2014.
It is, therefore, proposed to amend Decision (EU) 2015/435 accordingly by offsetting the amount mobilised in 2014 against the margins
available under the payment ceiling in 2017.

2016/2233(BUD) - 29/03/2017 Budgetary report tabled for plenary, 1st reading
The Committee on Budgets adopted the joint report by Jan OLBRYCHT (EPP, PL) and Isabelle THOMAS (S&D, FR) on the proposal for a
decision of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Decision (EU) 2015/435 on the mobilisation of the Contingency Margin.
Members recalled that in 2014, the European Parliament and the Council mobilised the contingency margin for an amount of EUR 3 168 233
715 in payment appropriations and that an amount of EUR 350 million was included in the mobilisation of the Contingency Margin pending an

agreement on the treatment of payments for special instruments.
It was decided to offset EUR 2 818 233 715 over the period 2018-2020 and to invite the Commission to present in a timely manner a proposal
concerning the remaining amount of EUR 350 million.
Members recalled that the budget for the year 2017 shows a margin below the payment ceiling of EUR 9.8 billion, allowing for the offsetting of
the full amount mobilised in 2014.
They welcomed the Commission proposal presented as a part of the MFF mid-term review/revision package. They considered that the
offsetting of a total amount of EUR 2 818 233 715 mobilised in 2014 against the margin under payment ceiling for the year 2017 will provide
for more flexibility for the second part of the MFF and will help preventing a new payment crisis.
They equally welcomed the Council agreement in principle to the annexed decision which is in line with the interpretation of the Parliament and
called on the Parliament to approve, without amendment, the decision annexed to this resolution to off-set EUR 2 818 233 715 mobilised in
2014 from the Contingency Margin, under the payment ceiling for the year 2017.

2016/2233(BUD) - 05/04/2017 Budgetary text adopted by Parliament
The European Parliament adopted by 470 votes to 166, with 66 abstentions, a resolution on the proposal for a decision of the European
Parliament and of the Council amending Decision (EU) 2015/435 on the mobilisation of the Contingency Margin.
Parliament recalled that in 2014, the European Parliament and the Council mobilised the contingency margin for an amount of EUR 3 168 233
715 in payment appropriations and that an amount of EUR 350 million was included in the mobilisation of the Contingency Margin pending an
agreement on the treatment of payments for special instruments.
It was decided to offset EUR 2 818 233 715 over the period 2018-2020 and to invite the Commission to present in a timely manner a proposal
concerning the remaining amount of EUR 350 million.
Parliament recalled that the budget for the year 2017 shows a margin below the payment ceiling of EUR 9.8 billion, allowing for the offsetting
of the full amount mobilised in 2014.
It welcomed the Commission proposal presented as a part of the MFF mid-term review/revision package. It considered that the offsetting of a
total amount of EUR 2 818 233 715 mobilised in 2014 against the margin under payment ceiling for the year 2017 will provide for more
flexibility for the second part of the MFF and will help preventing a new payment crisis.
It therefore approved, without amendment, the decision annexed to this resolution to off-set EUR 2 818 233 715 mobilised in 2014 from the
Contingency Margin, under the payment ceiling for the year 2017 while recalling Parliaments long standing position that payment
appropriations for special instruments are counted over and above the MFF ceilings.

2016/2233(BUD) - 04/07/2017 Final act
PURPOSE: to amend Decision (EU) 2015/435 on the mobilisation of the Contingency Margin.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision (EU) 2017/1331 of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Decision (EU) 2015/435 on the
mobilisation of the Contingency Margin.
CONTENT: by Decision (EU) 2015/435, the European Parliament and the Council mobilised the Contingency Margin for making available
additional payment appropriations in 2014, to be offset in 2018-2020.
This Decision amends Decision (EU) 2015/435. It stipulates that for the general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2014, the
Contingency Margin shall be mobilised to provide the amount of EUR 2 818 233 715 in payment appropriations over and above the payment
ceiling of the multiannual financial framework.
The abovementioned amount shall be offset against the margin under the payment ceiling for the year 2017 (rather than for the period
2018-2020).
The Decision recalls that according to the medium-term payment forecast presented in the context of the Mid-Term Review of the EU
multiannual financial framework for the period 2014-2020, pressure on the annual payment ceilings in the years 2018-2020 is to be expected.
The draft budget for the year 2017 shows a margin below the payment ceiling of EUR 9.6 billion, allowing for the offsetting of the full amount
mobilised in 2014.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 18.7.2017.
