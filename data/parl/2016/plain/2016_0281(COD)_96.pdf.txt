2016/0281(COD) - 14/09/2016 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to set up the European Fund for Sustainable Development (EFSD), the EFSD Guarantee and the EFSD Guarantee Fund to
support investments in regions outside the EU as a means to address root causes of migration.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: the proposal forms part of the External Investment Plan (EIP) announced in the 7 June 2016 Commission Communication on
establishing a new Partnership Framework with third countries under the European Agenda for Migration.
It is also in with the EU Global Strategy for Foreign and Security Policy with embeds challenges such as migration in the overall EU foreign
policy.
The EIP will be based on three pillars working hand in hand:
a new investment fund (pillar 1);
technical assistance (pillar 2), to help local authorities and companies to develop a higher number of sustainable projects and attract
investors;
and finally a range of dedicated thematic, national and regional EU development cooperation programmes combined with structured
political dialogue targeted at improving the investment climate and overall policy environment in the countries concerned (pillar 3).
Pillar 1 will be implemented through the EFSD. The EFSD will have the key objective of providing an integrated financial package to finance
investments starting in the regions of Africa and the Neighbourhood. The Commission called for a long term strategy by which the EU will
promote the sustainable development goals of the 2030 Agenda and thus continue to address root causes of migration. It shall also contribute
to the implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change (COP 21).
According to the Commission, the EFSD is expected to mobilise up to EUR 44 billion investments with funds from the general budget of the
Union and other sources of EUR 3 350 million until 2020.
CONTENT: this draft Regulation seeks to establish the European Fund for Sustainable Development (EFSD), the EFSD Guarantee and the
EFSD Guarantee Fund.
Purpose: the purpose of the EFSD as an integrated financial package shall be to support through the supply of financing capacity in the form
of grants, guarantees and other financial instruments to eligible counterparts investments and increased access to financing starting in African
and Neighbourhood partner countries.
The EFSD shall contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda with a particular focus on
sustainable growth, job creation, socio-economic sectors and on the support to micro, small and medium sized enterprises.
It should tackle root causes of migration and offering sustainable reintegration to returned migrants in their countries of origin while maximising
additionality, delivering innovative products and crowding in private sector funds.
Regional investment platforms: the EFSD shall be composed of regional investment platforms, which will combine financing from existing
blending facilities and the EFSD Guarantee. The management of the EFSD shall be ensured by the Commission. Regional investment
platforms will be focused to pursue the achievement of the sustainable development goals and better address root causes of migration.
Strategic board of the EFSD: the Commission shall be assisted by a strategic board. It shall provide strategic guidance and support the
Commission in setting overall investment goals as regards the use of the EFSD Guarantee. The strategic board shall also support overall
coordination and coherence between the regional investment platforms and with the external lending mandate operations managed by the
EIB, including the EIB resilience initiative.

The strategic board shall be composed of representatives of the Commission and of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs
and Security Policy (High Representative), of the Member States and of the EIB. The Commission may invite other contributors to become
members of the strategic board having regard where appropriate to the view of the board. Partner Countries and relevant regional
organisations, the eligible counterparts and the European Parliament may be given observer status, where appropriate.
Project assessment: a sound technical assessment and due diligence as well as a swift implementation of individual projects will be ensured.
The bankability and risk of the projects will be assessed by the eligible counterparts and verified by independent experts to ensure the
credibility vis-à-vis the private sector, before the investment proposals are approved by the Commission.
The EFSD Guarantee: the Union should make available a guarantee of EUR 1.5 billion to establish the EFSD Guarantee. This fund aims to
constitute guarantee capacity for credit enhancement that will ultimately benefit the final investments and allow risk sharing with other
investors, notably private actors. It will leverage additional financing, in particular from the private sector, by addressing the key factors that
enable crowding-in private investment.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the Union will make available a total of EUR 750 million for the EFSD Guarantee until 2020 stemming both
from the Union's general budget and the 11th European Development Fund (EDF). Further financing could be foreseen.
The Commission intends to propose the mobilisation of the contingency margin to provide EUR 250 000 000. Other contributions from the
Union budget would be made by the use of redeployments or refocusing of programmed funds. Further financing could also include other
contributions by other contributors, such as Member States.

2016/0281(COD) - 25/04/2017 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Development Committee on Budgets adopted a joint report by Eduard KUKAN (EPP,
SK), Doru-Claudian FRUNZULIC? (S&D, RO) and Eider GARDIAZABAL RUBIAL (S&D, ES) on the proposal for a regulation of the European
Parliament and of the Council on the European Fund for Sustainable Development (EFSD) and establishing the EFSD Guarantee and the
EFSD Guarantee Fund.
As a reminder, the EFSD is the first pillar of the External Investment Plan (EIP), under which the Commission also plans to enhance technical
assistance in partner countries (pillar 2) and to work towards improving the investment climate and overall policy environment in those
countries (pillar 3).
The committee recommended that the European Parliaments position adopted at first reading, following the ordinary legislative procedure,
should amend the Commission proposal as follows:
Purpose: the EFSD shall contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda and be guided by the
objectives of Union external action set out in Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and of Union development cooperation policy
set out in Article 208 TFEU and the internationally agreed development effectiveness principles, thus contributing to the Union's development
and neighbourhood policies, with a particular focus on the eradication of poverty, long-term sustainable and inclusive growth, decent job
creation, socio-economic sectors and on the support to micro, small and medium sized enterprises.
It shall also:
foster sustainable reintegration of migrants returning to their countries of origin;
strengthen resilience of transit and host communities;
contribute to the implementation of the Paris Agreement by targeting investments to sectors that advance climate change mitigation
and adaptation: at least 35 % of the financing to investments with components that contribute to climate action, renewable energy and
resource efficiency.
The EFSD shall be composed of regional investment platforms. These platforms shall be created by transforming the existing blending
facilities created by Commission decisions. The platforms for Africa and the Neighbourhood shall be established first.
The Commission shall work in close cooperation with the EIB supported by the other eligible counterparts as regards the operational
management of the EFSD Guarantee.
Strategic board of the EFSD: the Board shall ensure that investments have an appropriate and diversified geographical and thematic coverage
, while giving special attention to the Least Developed Countries and fragile States. They shall also support overall coordination,
complementarity and coherence between the regional investment platforms, between the three pillars of the EIP, between the EIP and the
Union's other efforts on migration and financing instruments and trust funds.
The European Parliament shall have observer status. In its strategic guidance, the strategic board shall take into account relevant European
Parliament resolutions and Council decisions and conclusions.
Regional operational boards: Members proposed that each regional investment platform shall have an operational board which shall support
the Commission in defining regional and sectoral investment goals and regional, sectoral and thematic investment windows and shall
formulate opinions on blending operations and on the use of the EFSD Guarantee.
Eligibility criteria for the use of the EFSD Guarantee: the EFSD Guarantee shall support financing and investment operations which address
market failures or sub-optimal investment situations and which:
respect the principle of additionality of EFSD financing and investment operations, involving a higher risk;
ensure complementarity with other initiatives, making sure that EFSD operations are clearly distinct, in particular from the external
lending mandate operations managed by the EIB;
are economically and financially viable, with due regard to the possible support from, and co-financing by, private and public partners
to the project, while taking into account the specific operating environment and capacities of countries identified as experiencing
fragility or conflict;
respect the principles of development effectiveness and implement agreed guidelines, principles and conventions including the UN
Principles for Responsible Investment, UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.

At least EUR 100 000 000 of EFSD Guarantee coverage shall be allocated for investments in the partner countries from the Eastern and
Southern Neighbourhood.
Investment windows: the Commission is empowered to adopt, after consultation with the strategic board, delegated acts supplementing this
Regulation by establishing a list of investment windows. The choice of investment windows shall be duly justified by an analysis of the market
failure or sub-optimal investment situations.
The Commission shall establish and publish a scoreboard of indicators to be used to ensure an independent and transparent assessment of
the potential and actual operations backed by the EFSD Guarantee.
Transparency and grievance mechanism: Members called on the Commission to publish on its web-portal information on financing and
investment operations. The Commission shall establish a Union centralised grievance mechanism for all EFSD-supported projects.

cash (Member States and other contributors) or guarantees (Member States) in order to increase the liquidity reserve and to increase the total
volume of the EFSD guarantee.
At least EUR 400 000 000 of the EFSD Guarantee coverage would be allocated to investments in partner countries eligible under the
