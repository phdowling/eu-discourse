2016/2141(INI) - 30/03/2017 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development adopted an own-initiative report by Maria NOICHL (S&D, DE) on the state of play of
farmland concentration in the EU: how to facilitate the access to land for farmers.
The report recalled that there is no exclusive or shared competence of the EU on land, as various EU policies deploy different political, social,
cultural and environmental aspects of land management. This creates the need for a more holistic approach to land governance at EU level.
In 2013, in the 27-member EU, only 3.1 % of farms controlled 52.2 % of farmland in Europe. By contrast, in 2013, 76.2 % of farms had the use
of only 11.2 % of the agricultural land. This places inequality of land use in the EU.
Too high a concentration of agricultural land splits society, destabilises rural areas, threatens food safety and thus jeopardises the
environmental and social objectives of Europe.
Farmland management: the report noted that there is a general shortage of comprehensive, transparent, up-to-date, high-value data
standardised at European level on price and volume movements on the European land market.
Member States are called upon to take better account of farmland conservation and management, and to transfers of land in their public
policies. They should regularly communicate to each other information about their national legislation regarding land, land use changes and, in
particular, cases involving speculative land purchases. They should also create harmonised farmland inventories in which all ownership rights,
and rights of use in respect of farm land, are recorded in an up-to-date, accurate and comprehensible manner while fully respecting the data
protection rights of the parties involved and presented in the form of anonymised, publicly accessible statistics.
The Commission is called upon to:
establish an observatory service for the collection of information and data on the level of farmland concentration throughout the Union;
set up a high-level task force to examine the problem of farmland concentration, to conduct a study on the impact that the policy
measures taken by the EU and the Member States have on land concentration and agricultural production, and to analyse the risks
that land concentration poses for food supply, employment, the environment, soil quality and rural development;
publish guidelines on the harmonisation of accounting practices, and to encourage the sharing of best practices in national
legislations, in order to identify measures to safeguard farmland and farm activities.
Financing: high investment costs hamper the acquisition and leasing of farmland and forested area for small to medium-sized family and
cooperative farms. Members stressed the difficulties of accessing credit in order to acquire land or tenure, especially for new entrants and
young farmers and called on the Commission to provide proper instruments, in the framework of the CAP and related policies, that facilitate
their entry into farming by ensuring fair access to sustainable credit.
According to Members, farmland should to be given special protection with a view to allowing the Member States, in coordination with local
authorities and farmers' organisations, to regulate the sale, use and lease of agricultural land in order to ensure food security.
CAP involvement: although land policy is essentially a matter for the Member States, it may be affected by the CAP, with serious impact on the
competitiveness of farms on the internal market. Member States are called upon to give small and medium-sized local producers, new entrants
and young farmers while ensuring equal gender access priority in the purchase and rental of farmland. Member stated must undertake a
targeted examination of the national implementation of the existing CAP with a view to identifying any undesirable effects of the concentration
of land.
In this regard, they welcomed the proposal to simplify the CAP, in particular those measures aimed at reducing costs and administrative

burdens for family farms, as well as for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in rural areas.
They stated that, under the reformed CAP, ceilings should be introduced, and the direct payments scheme adjusted, in such a way as to give
added weight to the first hectares, and that steps should be taken to facilitate investment and the disbursement of direct aid to small farms.
The Commission is called on to introduce a more effective aid redistribution system in order to guard against farmland concentration.

2016/2141(INI) - 27/04/2017 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 524 votes to 37, with 45 abstentions, a resolution on the state of play of farmland concentration in the
EU: how to facilitate the access to land for farmers.
Members recalled that there is no exclusive or shared competence of the EU on land, as various EU policies deploy different political, social,
cultural and environmental aspects of land management. This creates the need for a more holistic approach to land governance at EU level.
In 2013, in the 27-member EU, only 3.1 % of farms controlled 52.2 % of farmland in Europe. By contrast, in 2013, 76.2 % of farms had the use
of only 11.2 % of the agricultural land. This unequal distribution of farmland is the counterpart of unequal distribution of CAP subsidies and
runs counter to the European sustainable, multifunctional agricultural model, in which family farms are an important feature.
The concentration of farmland has an adverse effect on the development of rural communities and the socio-economic viability of rural areas,
and results in the loss of agricultural jobs.
Farmland management: Member States are called upon, in their public policies, to take better account of farmland conservation and
management, and to transfers of land.
Parliament noted that there is a general shortage of comprehensive, transparent, up-to-date, high-value data standardised at European level
on price and volume movements on the European land market.
Member States should regularly communicate to each other information about their national legislation regarding land, land use changes and,
in particular, cases involving speculative land purchases. They should also create harmonised farmland inventories in which all ownership
rights are recorded in an up-to-date database and presented in the form of anonymised, publicly accessible statistics.

The Commission is called on to introduce a more effective aid redistribution system in order to guard against farmland concentration.
Lastly, measures to combat the concentration of agricultural land should be maintained during the development of the draft CAP for the period
after 2020.
