Summary

2016/2015(IMM) - 15/07/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Legal Affairs adopted the report by Heidi HAUTALA (Greens/EFA, FI) on the request for defence of the privileges and
immunities of Rosario CROCETTA (former MEP, S&D, IT).
Members recalled that he requested the defence of his parliamentary immunity in connection with criminal proceedings pending before the

third Criminal Chamber of the Court of Palermo. He is alleged to have made defamatory statements during a political debate (statements
concerning fake public procurement and links to the mafia).
According to Article 8 of Protocol No 7, Members of the European Parliament may not be subject to any form of inquiry, detention or legal
proceedings in respect of opinions expressed or votes cast by them in the performance of their duties. Such immunity must, to the extent that
it seeks to protect the freedom of expression and independence of Members of the European Parliament, be considered as an absolute
immunity barring any judicial proceedings in respect of an opinion expressed or a vote cast in the exercise of parliamentary duties.
Rosario Crocetta was a Member of the European Parliament when he made the statements in question.
It is uncontested that, when he was a Member of the European Parliament and, in particular at the time of the statements in question, Mr
Crocetta was very much involved, at a political level, in the fight against organised crime and its influence on politics and economy. He has
always warned against the covert, but dangerous ramifications of organised crime, as witness his contribution to parliamentary work. Having
regard to content of the statements, Mr Crocettas allegations are, therefore, capable of presenting a direct and obvious link with his activities
as a Member of the European Parliament.
Therefore, the committee recommends the European Parliament to defend the privileges and immunities of Rosario Crocetta.

2016/2015(IMM) - 13/09/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament decided to defend the privileges and immunities of Rosario CROCETTA (former MEP, S&D, IT).
Parliament recalled that he requested the defence of his parliamentary immunity in connection with criminal proceedings pending before the
third Criminal Chamber of the Court of Palermo. He is alleged to have made defamatory statements during a political debate (statements
concerning fake public procurement and links to the mafia).
Parliament recalled that according to Article 8 of Protocol No 7, Members of the European Parliament may not be subject to any form of
inquiry, detention or legal proceedings in respect of opinions expressed or votes cast by them in the performance of their duties. Such
immunity must, to the extent that it seeks to protect the freedom of expression and independence of Members of the European Parliament, be
considered as an absolute immunity barring any judicial proceedings in respect of an opinion expressed or a vote cast in the exercise of
parliamentary duties.
Given that the statements by Rosario Crocetta were made when he was a Member of the European Parliament and that he was always very
involved in the fight against organised crime, including within the European Parliament, Parliament decided to defend his privileges and
immunities.
