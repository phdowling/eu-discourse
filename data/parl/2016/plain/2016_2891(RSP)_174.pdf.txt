Summary

2016/2891(RSP) - 05/10/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 472 votes to 103, with 99 abstentions, a resolution on the need for a European reindustrialisation policy
in light of the recent Caterpillar and Alstom cases.
The text adopted in plenary was tabled by the EPP, Greens/EFA, ECR, S&D and ALDE groups.
Members stressed the absolute need for consistency between the various EU policies in order to define an actual industrial policy, in particular
in the light of the Caterpillar and Alstom cases.
Parliament is convinced that European industry should be seen as a strategic asset for the competitiveness and sustainability of the EU,
stressing that the Commission and the Member States need to better anticipate these socio-economic situations and ensure the
competitiveness of our industrial network.
Recalling that Europe is a social market economy, Members urged the Member States to ensure effective protection against unlawful
dismissal. They considered that the reduction of administrative burdens and compliance costs for businesses, and the repeal of unnecessary
legislation while continuing to ensure high standards of consumer, employee, health and environmental protection, must be key components of
any EU reindustrialisation policy.
EU industrial policy should include a smart mix of supply- and demand-side measures aimed at re-localising the economy in the EU and
should steer investment into creativity, skills, innovation and sustainable technologies and promote the modernisation of Europes industrial
base.
Trade policy: Parliament recalled that the EU is largely open to competitors from third countries, third countries have several barriers in place
that discriminate against European companies. It stressed the need to:
establish an EU trade policy which is in line with its industrial objectives and takes account of the need to secure European industrial
jobs and avoid fresh relocations and further deindustrialisation;
reach a swift agreement on the revision of the regulations on trade defence instruments, in order to strengthen them significantly by
improving their reactivity and effectiveness;
prevent EU trade policy from fostering anti-competitive practices, including environmental dumping and in particular the dumping of
cheap and low-quality products that put European standards at risk and affect EU-based industries.
Competition policy and public procurement: Parliament called on the Commission to:
encourages the Commission to urgently take the world market as the reference when defining geographical markets in its analysis,
state aid rules must be better tailored in order to deliver innovation and sustainability;
better implement the EU regulations on public procurement. EU provisions allow for tenders which are abnormally low or where more
than 50 % of the value is realised outside the EU to be rejected.
Improved use of EU funds: Members called for increased cooperation and convergence among Member States in fiscal, social and budget
matters so as to facilitate the emergence of joint industrial projects. EU funds offer a great opportunity to finance sustainable investment in
energy and public transport infrastructure and smart deployment of information and communications technologies.
The Commission is called upon to work with the different industrial sectors in order to ensure the best possible use of European structural and
investment funds, and more precisely of the Regional Development Fund (RDF), to support R&D projects at regional level.
Parliament called for an EU smart specialisation agenda and for prioritising R&D in those sectors where the EU can lead.
The Commission and the European Investment Bank should particularly target those regions that have been most affected by
deindustrialisation and to accelerate support for projects in these regions as a matter of urgency, while ensuring that viable and high-quality
projects are supported.
Members added that tax avoidance should be prevented and is also a result of the lack of European coordination in fiscal and commercial
matters.
Socially responsible restructuring: Parliament called on all relevant authorities to ensure that all parties involved comply fully with national and
European regulations on information and consultation of workers, especially during restructuring.
Any restructuring operation should be explained and justified to stakeholders, where appropriate, including with respect to the choice of
measures envisaged in relation to the objectives and any alternatives. Members called for a sustained social dialogue, at all levels, based on
mutual trust and shared responsibilities.
Regretting the gradual financialisation of the real economy, focused on a short-term financial outlook, Parliament called on the Commission to
consult the social partners:
on the opportunity for a revision of the existing legislation regarding collective dismissals, and particularly the involvement in the
procedure of all workers and subcontractors,
on effective measures to avoid unlawful collective dismissals that are not based on real economic reasons, including the possibility of
sanctions - for example, suspending access to EU-funded programmes or demanding the repayment of public aid granted.
Lastly, the Commission is called upon to investigate and consider the need to revise the European Works Council Directive.
