2016/2267(BUD) - 19/10/2016 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: to mobilise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) to provide assistance to Germany following a series of intense
floods.
PROPOSED ACT: ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
CONTENT: Council Regulation (EU, EURATOM) No 1311/2013 lays down the multiannual financial framework for the years 2014-20201, and
in particular the Article 10 thereof allows for the mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund, within an annual ceiling of EUR 500
million (2011 prices), over and above the relevant headings of the financial framework.
Germany: on 19 August 2016, Germany submitted an application to mobilise the Fund, following a series of extremely intense, short-lived
cases of floods that affected the region of Niederbayern in May and June 2016.
The Commission carried out an in-depth examination of this application and considered that, taking account of the maximum possible
contribution from the Fund as well as the scope for reallocating appropriations, it would be possible to mobilise the European Union Solidarity
Fund for a total amount of EUR 31 475 125.
Direct damage: the German authorities presented a request based on the total amount of direct damage, that being EUR 1.259 billion.
Given that the application by Germany meets the conditions for providing a financial contribution from the Fund, as laid down in Article 4 of
Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002, it is proposed to mobilise the Fund in order to provide a financial contribution to Germany for the requested
amount.
The Commission will present a draft amending budget (DAB) in order to enter in the 2016 budget the specific commitment and payment
appropriations.
In the event of disagreement, a trilogue procedure will be initiated in accordance with Point 11 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 2
December 2013 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline, on cooperation in budgetary
matters and on sound financial management.

2016/2267(BUD) - 25/11/2016 Budgetary report tabled for plenary, 1st reading

The Committee on Budgets adopted the report by Monika HOHLMEIER (EPP, DE) on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament
and of the Council on the mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund to provide assistance to Germany.
Members called on the Parliament to approve the decision annexed to the draft resolution.
The proposal seeks to mobilise the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF) to provide EUR 31 475 125 to Germany following the floods,
affecting Lower Bavaria, especially the district of Rottal-Inn, in May and June 2016.
The proposed mobilisation requires an amendment to the 2016 budget and a draft amending budget (N°6/2016), aiming at increasing budget
article 13 06 01 'Assistance to Member States in the event of a major natural disaster with serious repercussions on living conditions, the
natural environment or the economy' by EUR 31 475 125 both in commitment and in payment appropriations.

2016/2267(BUD) - 01/12/2016 Budgetary text adopted by Parliament
The European Parliament adopted by 592 votes to 9, with 43 abstentions, a resolution on the proposal for a decision of the European
Parliament and of the Council on the mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund to provide assistance to Germany.
Parliament approved the decision annexed to the resolution.
The proposal seeks to mobilise the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF) to provide EUR 31 475 125 both in commitment and in payment
appropriations to Germany, in the framework of the general budget of the Union for the financial year 2016, following the floods, affecting
Lower Bavaria, especially the district of Rottal-Inn, in May and June 2016.

2016/2267(BUD) - 14/12/2016 Final act
PURPOSE: to mobilise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) to provide assistance to Germany following a series of intense
floods.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision (EU) 2017/340 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the mobilisation of the European Union
Solidarity Fund to provide assistance to Germany.
CONTENT: Council Regulation (EU, EURATOM) No 1311/2013 lays down the multiannual financial framework for the years 2014-2020, and in
particular the Article 10 thereof allows for the mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund, within an annual ceiling of EUR 500 million
(2011 prices), over and above the relevant headings of the financial framework.
The European Union Solidarity Fund aims to enable the Union to respond in a rapid, efficient and flexible manner to emergency situations in
order to show solidarity with the population of regions struck by natural disasters.
On 19 August 2016, Germany submitted an application to mobilise the Fund, following a series of extremely intense, short-lived cases of
floods that affected the region of Niederbayern in May and June 2016.
The application by Germany meets the conditions for providing a financial contribution from the Fund, as laid down in Article 4 of Regulation
(EC) No 2012/2002.
Therefore, the European Parliament and the Council decided to mobilise EUR 31 475 125 in commitment and payment appropriations, under
the framework of the general budget of the Union for the financial year 2016, in order to assist Germany.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 28.2.2017. The Decision shall apply from 14.12.2016.
