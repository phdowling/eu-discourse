OJ L 175 30.06.2016, p. 0008 Summary

2016/0033(COD) - 10/02/2016 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to extend the date of entry into application of both instruments that are comprised in MIFID II on markets in financial instruments.
PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: Directive 2014/65/EU (MiFID) together with Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 (MiFIR) was adopted in the wake of the financial
crisis. MiFID and MiFIR, collectively referred to as MiFID II, covers securities markets, investment intermediaries and trading venues. The new
framework reinforces and replaces the current MiFID framework (Directive 2004/39/EC).
Member States need to transpose the Directive by 3 July 2016. Both MiFID and MiFIR are scheduled to apply as of 3 January 2017 .
During the legislative process, the very high level of complexity of the MiFID II package and the need for a significant number of implementing
measures were recognised. To this end, a period of 30 months was foreseen between the adoption and the entry into application, instead of
the usual 18-24 months.
Despite this unusually long period, ESMA has made clear to the Commission that the technical implementing challenges are of such
magnitude that essential data infrastructures will not be in place in time for 3 January 2017. This is a result of significant challenges in
collecting the data that is necessary for the operation of the MiFID II rules.
The absence of data has ramifications across multiple areas of MIFID II. As regards market regulation, it is clear that without the foundation of
reference data (instrument ID) and the additional data infrastructures for transparency calculations and position reporting in place, it will not be
possible to apply the majority of the market rules.
In order to ensure legal certainty and avoid potential market disruption, urgent action is therefore needed to adjust the date of entry into
application for MiFID II
CONTENT: the purpose of the draft proposal amending Directive 2014/65/EU is to extend the entry into application of both instruments that
are comprised in the MIFID II package as a result of the technical implementation challenges met by the European Securities and Markets
Authority ('ESMA'), national competent authorities ('NCAs') and stakeholders.
In order to enable ESMA, NCAs and stakeholders to complete the operational implementation, the Commission considered it appropriate to
defer the date by which the Member States need to apply the measures transposing Directive 2014/65/EU and the date by which the repeal of
Directive 2004/39/EC is to take effect by 12 months until 3 January 2018. Reports and reviews should be deferred accordingly.
The Commission stated that an extension of one year should provide sufficient and reasonable time for ESMA, NCAs and operators to put in
place the infrastructure for data collection, reporting and the transparency threshold calculations.

2016/0033(COD) - 11/04/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs adopted the report by Markus FERBER (EPP, DE) on the proposal for a directive of the
European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments as regards certain dates.
The committee recommended that the European Parliaments position adopted at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure
should amend the Commission proposal as follows:
Exemptions: Members stated that this Directive shall not apply to persons dealing on own account in financial instruments other than
commodity derivatives or emission allowances or derivatives thereof and not providing any other investment services or performing any other
investment activities in financial instruments other than commodity derivatives or emission allowances or derivatives thereof unless such
persons: are either members of or participants in a regulated market or an MTF, on the one hand, or have direct electronic access to a trading
venue, on the other hand, and, in either case, are engaging in a high-frequency algorithmic trading strategy on such a trading venue .
Transposition: Members proposed that the Member States are to apply the measures transposing that Directive from 3 January 2017 (as
opposed to 3 July 2016).

2016/0033(COD) - 07/06/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 502 votes to 158, with 6 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a directive of the
European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments as regards certain dates.
Parliaments position, adopted at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure, amended the Commission proposal as follows:
Exemptions: Parliament stipulated that the exemption set out in point (d) of Article 2(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU should be extended to include
non-financial entities who are members of or participants in a regulated market or a multilateral trading facility (MTF), or have direct electronic
access to a trading venue when executing transactions on a trading venue which are objectively measurable as reducing risks directly relating
to the commercial activity or treasury financing activity of those non-financial entities or their groups.

Third-country market: the amended text stated that a third-country market shall be considered to be equivalent to a regulated market if the
requirements and the procedure laid down under the third and the fourth subparagraphs are fulfilled. At the request of the competent authority
of a Member State, the Commission shall adopt equivalence decisions in accordance with the examination procedure (comitology). The
competent authority shall indicate why it considers that the legal and supervisory framework of the third country concerned is to be considered
equivalent and shall provide relevant information to that end.
Such a third-country legal and supervisory framework may be considered equivalent where that framework fulfils at least the following
conditions:
the markets are subject to authorisation and to effective supervision and enforcement on an ongoing basis;
the markets have clear and transparent rules regarding admission of securities to trading so that such securities are capable of being
traded in a fair, orderly and efficient manner, and are freely negotiable;
security issuers are subject to periodic and ongoing information requirements ensuring a high level of investor protection; and
market transparency and integrity are ensured by the prevention of market abuse in the form of insider dealing and market
manipulation.
Committee procedure: the Commission shall be assisted by the European Securities Committee established by Commission Decision
2001/528/EC.
Transposition: Members proposed that the date of transposition of the Directive should be set at 3 July 2017 (instead of 3 July 2016).

2016/0033(COD) - 23/06/2016 Final act
PURPOSE: to put back by one year the time limit for transposition and application of rules on markets in financial instruments (MIFID II
package).
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Directive (EU) 2016/1034 of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in
financial instruments.
CONTENT: this Directive amends Directive 2014/65/EU (MIFID II) in order to put back the date of entry into application of the MIFID II,
following difficulties encountered by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and national competent authorities, and
stakeholders in technical implementation.
The MIFID II directive, like Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 (MiFIR) should be applied 30 months after entry into force, i.e. 3 January 2017. The
date of transposition of MIFID II is 3 July 2016. However, following difficulties in technical implementation encountered by ESMA and national
competent authorities, new data collection infrastructure will not be in place by 3 January 2017.
The implementation process for the data collection infrastructures involves five steps: business requirements, specifications, development,
testing and deployment. ESMA estimates that those steps will be completed by January 2018.
Deferral of dates: in order to ensure legal certainty and avoid potential market disruption, the Directive defers the date by which the Member
States need to transpose Directive 2014/65/EU to 3 July 2017. The new date for application of the Directive is 3 January 2018. The dates for
reports and review are set back accordingly.
Exemptions: the exemption set out in point (d) of Article 2(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU is extended to include non-financial entities who are
members of or participants in a regulated market or a multilateral trading facility (MTF), or have direct electronic access to a trading venue
when executing transactions on a trading venue which are objectively measurable as reducing risks directly relating to the commercial activity
or treasury financing activity of those non-financial entities or their groups.
Third-country markets: the Directive provides that a third-country market shall be considered to be equivalent to a regulated market if the
certain requirements laid down in the Directive are fulfilled. At the request of the competent authority of a Member State, the Commission shall
adopt equivalence decisions in accordance with the examination procedure (comitology).
The Directive sets out the conditions that the third-country legal and supervisory framework must fulfil in order to be considered equivalent.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 1.7.2016.
