2016/0252(NLE) - 24/08/2016 Initial legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude an agreement between the European Union and Iceland on the protection of geographical indications for agricultural
products and foodstuffs.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: Article 19 of the European Economic Area Agreement (EEA Agreement) contains provisions on trade in agricultural products.
The 2007 EU-Iceland bilateral Agreement on trade preferences includes, among others, a commitment by the Parties to promote trade in
products with geographical indications (GIs).
The EU-Iceland GIs negotiations were conducted from 4 July 2012 to 17 September 2015. The negotiations were carried out in conjunction
with the EU-Iceland negotiations on further liberalisation of trade in agricultural and processed agricultural products.
The conclusion of the GIs Agreement with Iceland fits into the overall EU strategy of promoting the production and the consumption of EU
products with GIs.

CONTENT: the Commission proposed that the Council adopt a decision, approving on behalf of the European Union, the Agreement between
the European Union and Iceland on the protection of geographical indications for agricultural products and foodstuffs.
Under this Agreement, 1 150 EU foodstuff GIs will obtain a high level of direct protection in Iceland.
The GIs will be protected against:
any direct or indirect commercial use;
any misuse, imitation or evocation of the product;
any other false or misleading indication as to the provenance, origin, nature or essential qualities of the product;
any other practice liable to mislead the consumer as to the true origin of the product.
Iceland has not yet registered any protected GI names.
The Agreement provides, however, a mechanism for updating the GIs list and for including new GI names at a later stage through a Joint
Committee process
The EEA Agreement already provides for the mutual recognition and protection of geographical indications for wines, aromatised wine
products and spirit drinks. Therefore the scope of this Agreement covers only agricultural products and foodstuffs other than wines, aromatised
wine products and spirit drinks.
The GIs Agreement will enter into force on the first day of the month following the date on which the Parties have notified each other that their
respective internal adoption procedures have been completed.

2016/0252(NLE) - 06/10/2016 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude the Agreement between the European Union and Iceland on the protection of geographical indications for agricultural
products and foodstuffs.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: the EU and Iceland are signatories to the Agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA Agreement). This Agreement
provides for the free movement of goods, with the exception of agricultural and fisheries products. This Agreement provides that the
contracting Parties shall undertake to continue their efforts to achieve progressive liberalisation of agricultural trade between them. Article 19
of the EEA Agreement contains provisions on trade in agricultural products. The 2007 EU-Iceland bilateral Agreement on trade preferences
negotiated on the basis of Article 19 of the EEA Agreement includes among others a commitment by the Parties to promote trade in products
with geographical indications (GIs).
The Agreement between the European Union and Iceland on the protection of geographical indications for agricultural products and foodstuffs
was signed by the Commission subject to its conclusion at a later date. The Agreement should now be approved.
CONTENT: the draft Council decision seeks the approval, on behalf of the European Union, of the Agreement between the European Union
and Iceland on the protection of geographical indications for agricultural products and foodstuffs.
The Parties agreed to promote between each other the harmonious development of geographical indications as defined in the Agreement on
Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and to foster trade in agricultural products and foodstuffs with geographical
indications originating in the Parties' territories.
Under the negotiated GIs Agreement, 1 150 EU foodstuff GIs will be protected in Iceland.
Iceland has not yet registered any protected GI names. The Agreement provides, however, a mechanism for updating the GIs list and for
including new GI names at a later stage through a Joint Committee process.

2016/0252(NLE) - 14/07/2017 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on International Trade adopted the report by David BORRELLI (EFDD, IT) on the draft Council decision on the conclusion of
the Agreement between the European Union and Iceland on the protection of geographical indications for agricultural products and foodstuffs.
The committee recommended that Parliament give its consent to the conclusion of the agreement.
In the short explanatory statement accompanying the report, it is recalled that the conclusion of the agreement is part of the overall strategy of
the European Union to promote the production and consumption of European products with geographical indications (GIs).
Under the negotiated geographical agreement, 1 150 EU foodstuff GIs will be protected in Iceland as in the rest of the EU against: (i) any
direct or indirect commercial use; (ii) any misuse, imitation or evocation of the product; (iii) any other false or misleading indication as to the
provenance, origin, nature or essential qualities of the product; (iv) any other practice liable to mislead the consumer as to the true origin of the
product.

2016/0252(NLE) - 12/09/2017 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 665 votes to 7, with 18 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the draft Council decision on the
conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and Iceland on the protection of geographical indications for agricultural products
and foodstuffs.

Following the recommendation of its Committee on International Trade, Parliament gave its consent to the conclusion of the agreement.
Under the Agreement, the Parties agree agreed to promote between each other the harmonious development of geographical indications as
defined in the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and to foster trade in agricultural products and
foodstuffs with geographical indications originating in the Parties' territories.
