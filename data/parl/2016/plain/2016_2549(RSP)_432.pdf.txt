Summary

2016/2549(RSP) - 03/02/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 433 votes to 232 with 35 abstentions, a resolution on the draft Commission implementing decision
authorising the placing on the market of products containing, consisting of, or produced from genetically modified soybean MON 87705 × MON
89788 (MON-877Ø5-6 × MON-89788-1) pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council.
The resolution was tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety
Parliament noted that the genetically modified MON-877Ø5-6 × MON-89788-1 soybean, as described in the application submitted on 11
August 2011 by Monsanto Europe S.A. to the competent authority of the Netherlands, has a reduced expression of fatty acid ?12-desaturase
(FAD2) and palmitoyl acyl carrier protein thioesterase (FATB) enzymes, which results in increased oleic acid and reduced linoleic acid profile
and expresses the CP4 EPSPS protein which confers tolerance to glyphosate herbicides. However, the World Health Organisation classified
glyphosate as probably carcinogenic to humans on 20 March 2015.

The draft Commission implementing decision was voted on in the Standing Committee on 18 November 2015, with no opinion being delivered.
Parliament stressed that since the entry into force of the current GMO authorisation procedure, decisions had been adopted by the
Commission without the support of the opinions of Member State committees. Thus, the return of the dossier to the Commission for the final
decision, which was very much the exception for the procedure as a whole, had become the norm for decision-making on genetically modified
(GM) food and feed authorisations;
Members also recalled that on 28 October 2015, Parliament had rejected the legislative proposal amending Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003
regarding the possibility for Member States to restrict or prohibit the use of genetically modified food and feed on their territory, and it called on
the Commission to withdraw its proposal and to submit a new one.
In the light of these considerations, Parliament considered that the draft Commission implementing decision is not consistent with Union law, in
that it is not compatible with the aim of ensuring a high level of protection of human life and health, animal health and welfare, environment and
consumer interests in relation to genetically modified food and feed, whilst ensuring the effective operation of the internal market.
Accordingly, Parliament asked the Commission to withdraw its draft implementing decision. The Commission was asked to submit a new
legislative proposal on the basis of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, amending Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 taking into
account frequently expressed national concerns which do not only relate to issues associated with the safety of GMOs for health or the
environment.
