2016/2187(DEC) - 11/07/2016 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: presentation by the Commission of the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2015, as part of
the 2015 discharge procedure.
Analysis of the accounts of the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA).
CONTENT: the organisational governance of the EU consists of institutions, agencies and other EU bodies whose expenditure is included in
the general budget of the Union.
The EU's operational expenditure of these institutions takes different forms, depending on how the money is paid out and managed.
From 2014 onwards, the Commission classifies its expenditure as follows:
Direct management: the budget is implemented directly by the Commission services.
Indirect management: the Commission confers tasks of implementation of the budget to bodies of EU law or national law, such as the
EU agencies.
Shared management: under this method of budget implementation tasks are delegated to Member States. About 80 % of the
expenditure falls under this management mode covering such areas as agricultural spending and structural actions.
This Commission document concerns the EU's consolidated accounts for the year 2015 and details how spending by the EU institutions and
bodies was carried out. The consolidated annual accounts of the EU provide financial information on the activities of the institutions, agencies
and other bodies of the EU from an accrual accounting and budgetary perspective.

It is the responsibility of the Commission's Accounting Officer to prepare the EU's consolidated annual accounts and ensure that they present
fairly, in all material aspects, the financial position, the result of the operations and the cash flows of the EU institutions and bodies, including
the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), with a view to granting discharge.
Discharge procedure: the final step of a budget lifecycle is the discharge of the budget for a given financial year. It represents the political
aspect of the external control of budget implementation and is the decision by which the European Parliament, acting on a Council
recommendation, "releases" the Commission (and other EU bodies) from its responsibility for management of a given budget by marking the
end of that budget's existence. The European Parliament is the discharge authority within the EU.
The discharge procedure may produce three outcomes: (i) the granting; (ii) postponement or; (iii) the refusal of the discharge.
The final discharge report including specific recommendations to the Commission for action is adopted in plenary by the European Parliament
and are subject to an annual follow up report in which the Commission outlines the concrete actions it has taken to implement the
recommendations made.
Each agency is subject to its own discharge procedure, including the EIOPA.
The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA): the EIOPA, which is located in Frankfurt (DE), was set up by
Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council with a view to protecting the public interest by contributing to the
short, medium and long-term stability and efficiency of the financial system for the economy of the European Union.
As regards the EIOPAs accounts, these are presented in detail in the document on the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union
for 2015:
Commitment appropriations:
-

committed: EUR 20 million;

-

paid: EUR 20 million;

-

carried-over: 0.

Payment appropriations:
-

committed: EUR 26 million;

-

paid: EUR 22 million;

-

carried-over: EUR 3 million.

For further details on expenditure, please refer to the final accounts of the Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority.

2016/2187(DEC) - 13/09/2016 Court of Auditors: opinion, report
PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions
Authority (EIOPA) for the year 2015, together with the EIOPAs reply.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit focused on the annual accounts of the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA). To recall, the Authoritys
task is to contribute to the establishment of high-quality common regulatory and supervisory standards and practices, to contribute to the
consistent application of legally binding Union acts, to stimulate and facilitate the delegation of tasks and responsibilities among competent
authorities, to monitor and assess market developments in the area of its competence and to foster the protection of policyholders, pension
scheme members and beneficiaries.
Statement of assurance: pursuant to the provisions of Article 287 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the Court
has audited:
the annual accounts of the Agency, which comprise the financial statements and the reports on the implementation of the budget for
the financial year ended 31 December 2015, and
the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying those accounts.
Opinion on the reliability of the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the Authoritys annual accounts present fairly, in all material respects, its
financial position as at 31 December 2015 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the
provisions of its Financial Regulation and the accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
Opinion on the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the transactions underlying the annual
accounts for the year ended 31 December 2015 are legal and regular in all material respects.
The report made a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of the Authority, accompanied by the latters response.
The main observations may be summarised as follows:
The Courts observations:
budgetary management: the Court noted that the level of committed appropriations carried over is high for operational expenditure at
EUR 2.3 million. These carry-overs are mainly related to specific contracts for operational information and data management (EUR 1.9
million), whereby contracts amounting to EUR 900 000 were signed late in the year, mainly for services to be provided in 2016.

The Authoritys reply:
budgetary management: the Authority noted that the relatively high carry-over percentage was mainly due to the execution of EIOPAs
multiannual IT programme supporting the Solvency II implementation. Improvements have been made in the past years which have
substantially decreased the carry over levels from 2013 to 2016.
Lastly, the Court of Auditors report also contained a summary of the Authoritys key figures in 2015:
Budget: EUR 20.2 million (payment appropriations).
Staff: 133 including officials, temporary and contract staff and seconded national experts.

2016/2187(DEC) - 07/02/2017 Supplementary non-legislative basic document
Having examined the revenue and expenditure accounts for the financial year 2015 and the balance sheet as at 31 December 2015 of the
European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), as well as the Court of Auditors' report on the annual accounts of the
Authority for the financial year 2015, accompanied by the Authority's replies to the Court's observations, the Council recommended the
European Parliament to give a discharge to the Executive Director of the Authority in respect of the implementation of the budget for the
financial year 2015.
The Council welcomed the Court's opinion that, in all material respects, the Authority's annual accounts present fairly its financial position as at
31 December 2015 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions of the
Authority's Financial Regulation, and that the underlying transactions for 2015 are legal and regular in all material respects.
Nevertheless, one observation was made:
financial programming: the Council noted that a high level of commitment appropriations was carried over to 2016. It encouraged the
Authority to continue improving its financial programming and monitoring of the budget implementation, in order to reduce the level of
commitments carried over to the following financial year to the minimum strictly necessary.

2016/2187(DEC) - 29/03/2017 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Inés AYALA SENDER (S&D, ES) on discharge in respect of the implementation of
the budget of the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) for the financial year 2015.
The committee called on the European Parliament to grant the Executive Director of the Authority discharge in respect of the implementation
of the Authoritys budget for the financial year 2015.
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it had obtained reasonable assurance that the annual accounts of the Authority for the financial
year 2015 were reliable and that the underlying transactions were legal and regular, Members called on Parliament to approve the closure of
the Authoritys accounts. They made, however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is
granted, in addition to the general recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of
EU agencies:
Agencys financial statements: Members noted that the final budget of the Authority for the financial year 2015 was EUR 20 212 701,
representing a decrease of 6.35 % compared to 2014.
Budget and financial management: Members noted that budget monitoring efforts during the financial year 2015 resulted in a budget
implementation rate of 99.97 %, reaching the Authoritys planned target and representing a decrease of 0.03 % compared to 2014.
Commitments and carry-overs: Members noted that the level of committed appropriations carried over for operational expenditure was
at EUR 2.3 million (45 % of expenditure), compared to EUR 4.7 million (66 % of expenditure) in 2014. Those carryovers were
predominantly related to specific contracts for the Authoritys multi-annual IT programme supporting the implementation of Solvency II
and to contracts signed late in the year.
Members also made a series of observations regarding transfers, procurement, recruitment procedures, the prevention and management of
conflicts of interests and internal audits.
Lastly, Members noted that the Authority does not exercise all the prerogatives established in its legal framework. They underlined that it
should ensure that resources are maximised in order to fully fulfil its legal mandate given to it by the European Parliament and the Council
which could result in a more effective achievement of its objectives.

2016/2187(DEC) - 27/04/2017 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament decided to grant the Executive Director of the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA)
discharge in respect of the implementation of Authoritys budget for the financial year 2015. The vote on the decision on discharge covers the
closure of the accounts (in accordance with Annex IV, Article 5 (1) (a) to Parliaments Rules of Procedure).
Noting that the Court of Auditors has stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the Authoritys annual accounts for the financial
year 2015 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Parliament adopted by 509 votes to 113 with 9 abstentions, a
resolution containing a series of recommendations, which form an integral part of the decision on discharge and which add to the general
recommendations set out in the resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies.
These recommendations may be summarised as follows:
Agencys financial statements: Parliament noted that the final budget of the Authority for the financial year 2015 was EUR 20 212 701,
representing a decrease of 6.35 % compared to 2014.

Budget and financial management: Parliament noted that budget monitoring efforts during the financial year 2015 resulted in a budget
implementation rate of 99.97 %, reaching the Authoritys planned target and representing a decrease of 0.03 % compared to 2014.
Commitments and carry-overs: Parliament noted that the level of committed appropriations carried over for operational expenditure
was at EUR 2.3 million (45 % of expenditure), compared to EUR 4.7 million (66 % of expenditure) in 2014. Those carryovers were
predominantly related to specific contracts for the Authoritys multi-annual IT programme supporting the implementation of Solvency II
and to contracts signed late in the year.
Parliament also made a series of observations regarding transfers, procurement, recruitment procedures, the prevention and management of
conflicts of interests and internal audits.
It noted that in 2016 the communication strategy was reviewed with the aim to provide more accessible and easily understandable information
in particular for consumers and the public at large, with the review and redesign of the Authoritys website being one of the key objectives.
Lastly, Parliament noted that the Authority does not exercise all the prerogatives established in its legal framework. It underlined that it should
ensure that resources are maximised in order to fully fulfil its legal mandate given to it by the European Parliament and the Council with a view
to contributing to the drafting of recommendations by including all parties concerned, and in particular consumer protection organisations.

2016/2187(DEC) - 27/04/2017 Final act
PURPOSE: to grant discharge to the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) for the financial year 2015.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision (EU) 2017/1675 of the European Parliament on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of
the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority for the financial year 2015.
CONTENT: with the present decision, the European Parliament grants discharge to the Executive Director of the European Insurance and
Occupational Pensions Authority for the implementation of the latters budget for the financial year 2015.
This decision is in line with the European Parliament's resolution adopted on 27 April 2017 and comprises a series of observations that form
an integral part of the discharge decision (please refer to the summary of the opinion of 27 April 2017).
Amongst Parliaments main observations in the resolution accompanying the discharge decision, the latter wished to note that the Authority is
working to develop more sophisticated and less output-focussed key performance indicators, which would provide a more valuable basis to
assess whether the Authority is achieving its strategic ambitions.
Parliament recalled that the Authority was expected to establish internal rules on whistleblowing by the beginning of 2017. It asked the
Authority to report to the discharge authority on the establishment and implementation of its whistleblowing rules.
Given that the Authority does not exercise all the prerogatives established in its legal framework, Parliament a closer focus on the mandate
given to it by Parliament and the Council could result in a more effective achievement of its objectives. While carrying out its work and in
particular when drafting implementing legislation, the Authority needs to inform Parliament and the Council about its activities in a regular and
comprehensive manner.
