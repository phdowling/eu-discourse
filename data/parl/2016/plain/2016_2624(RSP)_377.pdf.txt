Summary

2016/2624(RSP) - 13/04/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 374 to 225 with 102 abstentions a resolution on the draft Commission implementing regulation renewing
the approval of the active substance glyphosate in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the
Council concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market, and amending the Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) No
540/2011.
Members recalled the systemic herbicide glyphosate currently has the highest global production volume of all herbicides. Its global use has
increased dramatically, by a factor of 260, in the last 40 years (from 3 200 tonnes in 1974 to 825 000 tonnes in 2014). 76 % of the use of
glyphosate worldwide is in agriculture. It is also widely used in forestry, urban and garden applications.
In March 2015 the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified glyphosate as probably carcinogenic to humans (Group 2A).
In November 2015 the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) finalised a peer review of glyphosate and concluded that glyphosate is unlikely
to pose a carcinogenic hazard to humans and the evidence does not support classification with regard to its carcinogenic potential according
to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008.
In its draft implementing regulation, and based on scientific evaluation conducted both by the BfR and EFSA, the Commission proposes to
authorise glyphosate until 30 June 2031, i.e. for the maximum period possible, for any use, with a restriction for one of the co-formulants and
the establishment by Member States of a list of co-formulants not accepted for inclusion in plant protection products, without any legally
binding conditions on its use, and subject only to confirmatory information on endocrine-disrupting properties.
Parliament considered that the Commissions draft implementing regulation fails to ensure a high level of protection of both human and animal
health and the environment, fails to apply the precautionary principle, and exceeds the implementing powers provided for in Regulation (EC)
No 1107/2009. It called on the Commission to submit a new draft implementing regulation in order to better address the sustainable use of
herbicides containing glyphosate.
The Commission was asked to:
·

renew the approval of glyphosate for 7 years (rather than the 15 years proposed in the draft regulation);

·

re-evaluate its approval in light of the pending submission of a dossier concerning the harmonised classification of glyphosate under
Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA);

·

rapidly ensure an independent review of the overall toxicity and classification of glyphosate based on all available scientific evidence,
including that relating to carcinogenicity of glyphosate, as well as possible endocrine-disruptive properties under the expected
scientific horizontal criteria for endocrine disruptors;

·

mandate its Food and Veterinary Office to test and monitor glyphosate residues in foods and drinks produced in the Union, as well
as in imported produce.

Furthermore, the Commission must not approve any use of glyphosate:
·

for non-professional use;

·

in or close to public parks, public playgrounds and public gardens;

·

in agriculture where integrated pest management systems are sufficient for the necessary weed control.

Members found unacceptable the practice known as green burndown, where glyphosate is used for desiccation, i.e. the killing of the actual
crop plant prior to harvest in order to accelerate its ripening and facilitate its harvesting. This practice not only has significant adverse effects
on biodiversity, but also typically results in much higher residue levels in the final harvested products, and thus leads to increased human
dietary exposure.
The Commission was asked to: (i) carry out an assessment by the Commission, together with experts from Member States, to evaluate the
use of plant protection products for non-professionals; (ii) make proposals, to develop training and user authorisation for professionals, (iii)
place strict limits on the pre-harvest use of products containing the active substance glyphosate.
Lastly, Parliament called on the Commission and Member States to finance research and innovation with regard to alternative sustainable and
cost-efficient solutions for pest-management products to ensure a high level of protection of human and animal health and the environment.
