2016/0193(COD) - 27/06/2016 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to help those Member States mostly affected by the financial crisis to be able to continue with the implementation of the
programmes on the ground, hence injecting funds into the economy.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: the sustained financial and economic crisis is increasing the pressure on national financial resources, as Member States are
reducing their budgets.
In this context, ensuring a smooth implementation of ESIF programmes is of particular importance as a tool for injecting funds into the
economy.
Article 24 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council provides that on the request of a Member
State with temporary budgetary difficulties, i.e. those countries which have received financial assistance under an adjustment
programme after 21 December 2013, interim payments may be increased by 10 percentage points above the co-financing rate
applicable to each priority for the ERDF, ESF, and the Cohesion Fund or to each measure for the EAFRD and the EMFF, provided the
Member State submits a corresponding request. This provision currently applies until 30 June 2016.
Article 120(3) of the same Regulation provides that from 1 January 2014 to 30 June 2017, the maximum co-financing rate at the level
of each priority for all operational programmes supported by the ERDF and ESF in Cyprus shall be 85 % instead of 50 % applicable to
more developed regions.
The Regulation requires the Commission to review these two financial provisions and make, if necessary, a legislative proposal before 30 June
2016 with a view to their possible extension. The
Five countries were eligible for the 10% top-up on interim payments submitted before 30 June 2016. Since then the financial assistance
programmes for Cyprus, Ireland, Portugal and Romania have expired. This means that Greece is the only country under an adjustment
programme on 30 June 2016.
Cyprus exited its adjustment programme at the end of March 2016. However, the economic situation of Cyprus is still fragile as reflected by its
sluggish growth rate, declining investment, high unemployment and stressed financial sector.
CONTENT: in order to ensure that Member States with temporary budgetary difficulties continue implementing the ESIF programmes and
disburse funds to projects, the proposal to amend Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 would allow the Commission to:
top up payments to a Member State under an adjustment programme after 30 June 2016 (currently Greece). It would cover the period
until 30 June of the year following the calendar year in which the Member State stops receiving financial assistance. This approach is
in line with the ESI Funds accounting year which covers the period from 1 July to 30 June. It would extend the period of eligibility up to
maximum 18 months;
extend the exceptional cofinancing rate of 85 % for the ERDF and ESF in Cyprus until programme closure with a view to easing the
pressure on the national budget and accelerating much-needed investments.
The total financial allocation for the period from the Funds to the countries and the programmes in question will not change.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: there is no impact on commitment appropriations since no modification is proposed to the maximum amounts
of ESIF financing provided for in the operational programmes for the programming period 2014-2020.
For payment appropriations, the proposal can result in a higher reimbursement to the Member States concerned. Based on the payment
forecast from Member States revised by the Commission and the payment appropriations included in the 2016 budget and in the 2017 Draft
Budget, the need for payment appropriations are estimated to amount to approximately EUR 544 million . The additional payment
appropriations for this proposal may imply a temporary increase of payment appropriations, which would be compensated by lower payments
at the end of the life cycle of the 2014-2020 programmes.

2016/0193(COD) - 17/10/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Regional Development adopted the report by Iskra MIHAYLOVA (ADLE, BG) on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 as regards certain provisions relating to financial
management for certain Member States experiencing or threatened with serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability.

The committee recommended the Parliament to adopt its position at first reading, taking over the Commission proposal.
In order to ensure that Member States with temporary budgetary difficulties continue implementing the ESIF programmes and disburse funds
to projects, the proposal to amend Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 would allow the Commission to:
top up payments to a Member State under an adjustment programme after 30 June 2016 (currently Greece). It would cover the period
until 30 June of the year following the calendar year in which the Member State stops receiving financial assistance. This approach is
in line with the ESI Funds accounting year which covers the period from 1 July to 30 June. It would extend the period of eligibility up to
maximum 18 months;
extend the co-financing rate of 85 % for all operational programmes supported by the ERDF and ESF in Cyprus until closure of the
operational programme 2014-2020.
In the explanatory statement in the draft legislative resolution, the rapporteur welcomed the Commission proposal as a focussed and
budgetary-neutral solution to the temporary liquidity problems faced by two Member States. Therefore, she recommended that the committee
and Parliament at plenary stage should take over the Commission proposal without amendment.

2016/0193(COD) - 25/10/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 627 votes to 34, with 31 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 as regards certain provisions relating to financial
management for certain Member States experiencing or threatened with serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability.
Parliament adopted its position at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure without making amendments to the Commission
proposal.
In order to ensure that Member States with temporary budgetary difficulties continue implementing the European Structural and Investment
Funds (ESIF) programmes and disburse funds to projects, the proposal to amend Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 would allow the Commission
to:
make top up payments to a Member State under an adjustment programme after 30 June 2016. The increased rate shall apply to its
payment applications for the period until 30 June of the year following the calendar year in which the related financial assistance
comes to an end;
extend the co-financing rate of 85 % for all operational programmes supported by the ERDF and ESF in Cyprus until closure of the
operational programme 2014-2020.

2016/0193(COD) - 23/11/2016 Final act
PURPOSE: to help those Member States mostly affected by the financial crisis to be able to continue with the implementation of the
programmes on the ground, hence injecting funds into the economy.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Regulation (EU) 2016/2135 of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 as
regards certain provisions relating to financial management for certain Member States experiencing or threatened with serious difficulties with
respect to their financial stability.
CONTENT: this Regulation amends Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 establishing common provisions on the European Structural and
Investment Funds with a view to ensuring that Member States mostly affected by the financial crisis are able to continue with the smooth
implementation of the programmes.
(1) Article 24 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 authorises the Commission to make increased payments under the ESI Fund programmes to
countries facing economic difficulties. On the request of a Member State, interim payments may be increased by 10 percentage points above
the co-financing rate applicable to each priority for the ERDF, ESF and the Cohesion Fund or to each measure for the EAFRD and the EMFF.
Five countries were eligible for the 10% top-up on interim payments submitted before 30 June 2016. Since then the financial assistance
programmes for Cyprus, Ireland, Portugal and Romania have expired.
Only Greece is still under an adjustment programme until 30 June 2016 and benefits from related financial assistance until the third quarter of
2018. Given that Greece still faces serious difficulties with respect to its financial stability, the duration of the application of an increase in
payments for Member States with temporary budgetary difficulties should be extended.
(2) Article 120(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 requires the Commission to carry out a review to assess the justification for maintaining a
maximum co-financing rate of 85 % instead of 50 % at the level of each priority axis for all operational programmes supported by the European
Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and European Social Fund (ESF) in Cyprus after 30 June 2017 and to make, if necessary, a legislative
proposal before 30 June 2016.
Cyprus exited from its adjustment programme in March 2016. However, the economic situation of Cyprus is still fragile.
Therefore the amendments made to Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 allow the Commission to:
top up payments to a Member State under an adjustment programme after 30 June 2016. It would cover the period until 30 June of
the year following the calendar year in which the Member State stops receiving financial assistance;
extend the exceptional cofinancing rate of 85 % for the ERDF and ESF in Cyprus until programme closure with a view to easing the
pressure on the national budget and accelerating much-needed investments.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 14.12.2016.
