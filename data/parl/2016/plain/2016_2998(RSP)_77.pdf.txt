Summary

2016/2998(RSP) - 18/05/2017 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a resolution on achieving the two-state solution in the Middle East.
The text adopted in plenary was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ECR, ALDE and Greens/EFA and other groups.
Recalling that achieving peace in the Middle East remains a key priority for the international community, Parliament reiterated its strong
support for the two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on the basis of the 1967 borders, with Jerusalem as the capital of both
states, with the secure State of Israel and an independent, democratic, contiguous and viable Palestinian State living side by side in peace and
security.
Members strongly opposed all actions that undermine the viability of the two-state solution. They condemned all acts of violence, acts of
terrorism against Israelis and hate speech in order to rebuild confidence and to avoid escalation that will further undermine the prospects for
peace.
Stressing that settlements are illegal under international law, Parliament condemned the continuation of, and called on the Israeli authorities to
immediately halt and reverse, the settlement policy.
It called for an end to the demolition of Palestinian homes and EU-funded structures and projects and ensure that no EU funding can be
directly or indirectly diverted to terrorist organisations or activities that incite these acts. In this regard, it stressed the imperative need to
prevent the arming of terrorist groups and their smuggling of weapons, manufacturing of rockets and building of tunnels.
Deploring continued Palestinian disunity, Members urged the Palestinian forces to resume efforts towards reconciliation without delay.
Parliament called on the HR to launch a bold and comprehensive European peace initiative in the region accompanied by an international
monitoring and implementation mechanism. It stressed the importance of engaging with other international actors in this regard, in the
framework of the Middle East Quartet and with regard to the Arab peace initiative in particular.
In order to support a genuine European peace initiative, it is the primary duty of the Member States to contribute actively to the shaping of a
united European position and to refrain from unilateral initiatives that weaken European action.
Members suggested that a Parliamentarians for Peace initiative be launched aimed at bringing together European, Israeli and Palestinian
parliamentarians.
