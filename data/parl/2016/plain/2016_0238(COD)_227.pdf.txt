Summary

PURPOSE: to establish a multi-annual plan for demersal stocks in the North Sea and the fisheries exploiting those stocks.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides following the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing
with Council.
BACKGROUND: in the framework of the common fisheries policy established by Regulation (EU) 1380/2013, multi-annual plans should
contribute to achieving fishing at sustainable levels (Maximum Sustainable Yield). The fisheries of the North Sea and adjacent areas are highly
complex, involving vessels from at least seven coastal Member States, as well as Norway, using a wide variety of different fishing gears to
target a wide range of different fish and shellfish species. A key issue is that many of the most important demersal stocks (i.e. those that live
on or near the bottom of the sea) are caught in mixed fisheries. The proposal presented by the Commission establishes a plan taking into
account such mixed fisheries interactions.
The Basic Regulation aims at solving the problems of overfishing and discarding fish. However, without additional legislation, the Basic
Regulation could lead to under-utilisation of quota in the North Sea mixed fisheries and would not allow any exemptions from the landing
obligation to be adopted after the three year discard plans have expired. Hence, if no appropriate measures are taken, the Basic Regulation
might have negative economic and social consequences for the fishing industry in the coming years.
IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred choice (a single mixed fishery multi-annual plan for North Sea demersal fisheries), wherein FMSY
(maximum rate of fishing mortality) is achieved by 2020 at the latest and stocks are rebuilt to within precautionary levels quickly is judged to be
more effective than Option 1 (to manage using the Basic Regulation) to achieve the objectives of the initiative.
CONTENT: the proposal aims to establish a multi-annual plan for demersal stocks in the North Sea and the fisheries exploiting those stocks in
order to contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the CFP set out in Regulation 1380/2013. The plan will:
ensure the sustainable exploitation of these stocks, by ensuring that they are exploited according to the principles of maximum
sustainable yield and of the ecosystem approach to fisheries management;
provide stability of fishing opportunities, while ensuring that management is based on the most up to date scientific information on
stocks, mixed fisheries and other aspects of the ecosystem and environment;
facilitate the introduction of the landing obligation.
The proposal aims to replace the current plan for cod, as well as the plan for plaice and sole by bringing all multi-annual plans for the different
demersal stocks into one regulation.
The plan will apply to all Union fishing vessels irrespective to their overall length in fishing in the North Sea as this is in conformity with the
rules of the CFP and is in line with the effect of the vessels on the fish stocks concerned. The proposed plan:
requires the EU to set catch limits that restore and maintain fish stocks above levels that can produce the Maximum Sustainable Yield
(MSY);
defines ranges within which catch limits can be set. Fishing opportunities in the higher part of the ranges will only be possible under
clearly defined conditions and in line with the MSY approach;
establishes safeguard measures for biomass based on the precautionary approach laid out in the Basic Regulation;
obliges the EU to take swift action when the sustainability of any demersal North Sea fish stock is threatened;
establishes the necessary framework for implementing regionalisation within the North Sea and provides for regional cooperation
among Member States regarding the adoption of measures on the landing obligation and specific conservation measures for certain
stocks;
adopt thresholds above which catches of demersal stocks should only be landed in designated ports;
does not include annual limits on fishing effort (the numbers of days at sea).
There will be periodic evaluation (every five years) of the impact of the plan on the stock concerned based on scientific advice.

2016/0238(COD) - 18/07/2017 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Fisheries adopted the report by Ulrike RODUST (S&D, DE) on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament
and of the Council on establishing a multi-annual plan for demersal stocks in the North Sea and the fisheries exploiting those stocks and
repealing Council Regulation (EC) 676/2007 and Council Regulation (EC) 1342/2008.
The committee recommended that the European Parliament's position adopted at first reading in accordance with the ordinary legislative
procedure should amend the Commission proposal as follows.
Purpose and scope: the Regulation establishes a multiannual plan for the demersal stocks in waters of Union waters of ICES zones IIa, IIIa
and IV (North Sea) and the fisheries, including recreational fisheries, exploiting those stocks.
Demersal stocks shall cover those roundfish, flatfish and cartilaginous fish species, Norway lobster ( Nephrops Norvegicus) and Northern
prawn (Pandalus borealis) that live at or near the bottom of the water column.
Members recalled that the aim of this plan should be to help achieve the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), in particular to
restore and maintain fish stocks at biomass levels above those to achieve maximum sustainable yield (MSY). The plan shall contribute to:
the implementation of the landing obligation for demersal stocks subject to catch limits;
the implementation and achievement of the socio-economic aspects of the CFP and contributing to the implementation of the
ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management by minimising the negative effects of fishing on the marine ecosystem;
the achievement of good environmental status and favourable conservation status for habitats and species.
All actions taken under the plan should be based on the best available scientific advice.
Prohibited species: group 6 in the Commission proposal refers to the list of prohibited species as they currently appear in Article 12 of Council
Regulation (EU) 2017/127. Members suggested referring to a less flexible list by specifying the definition of prohibited species.

Targeted objectives: in line with the provisions of the Baltic Sea Management Plan, Members proposed:
fishing opportunities be fixed in such a way as to ensure that there is less than a 5 % probability of the spawning stock biomass falling
below the limit spawning stock biomass reference point (Blim);
that the Commission may urgently submit a proposal to revise the fishing mortality ranges set out in Annex I if it considers, on the
basis of the best scientific advice available, that these ranges are no longer in line with the objectives of the plan.
Measures of the multiannual plan based on the precautionary approach must guarantee a degree of conservation of the relevant stocks that is
at least comparable to exploitation rates in accordance with the maximum sustainable yield.
Fishing opportunities: when allocating the fishing opportunities available to them, Member States should take account of transparent and
objective criteria. In the case of joint management of stocks shared with third countries, Member States should allow the exchange of fishing
opportunities.
Impact of recreational fishing: a new provision shall provide for the review of available data on recreational fishery catches to determine their
potential impact on the stocks of regulated species.
Technical measures: Members suggested that a specific chapter should be created to allow technical measures to be put in place in general.
The Commission may adopt delegated acts in respect of:
specifications of characteristics of fishing gears and rules governing their use, to ensure or improve selectivity, to reduce unwanted
catches or to minimise the negative impact on the ecosystem;
limitations or prohibitions on the use of certain fishing gears and on fishing activities, in certain areas or periods to protect spawning
fish, fish below the minimum conservation reference size or non-target fish species, or to minimise the negative impact on the
ecosystem;
the fixing of minimum conservation reference sizes for any of the stocks to which this Regulation applies, to ensure the protection of
juveniles of marine organisms.
The Commission shall be empowered to establish biologically sensitive protected areas.

2016/0238(COD) - 14/09/2017 Text adopted by Parliament, partial vote at 1st reading/single
reading
The European Parliament adopted by 532 votes to 44, with 20 abstentions, amendments to the proposal for a regulation of the European
Parliament and of the Council on establishing a multi-annual plan for demersal stocks in the North Sea and the fisheries exploiting those
stocks and repealing Council Regulation (EC) 676/2007 and Council Regulation (EC) 1342/2008.
The matter was referred back to the committee responsible for interinstitutional negotiations.
Purpose and scope: the Regulation establishes a multiannual plan for the demersal stocks in waters of Union waters of ICES zones IIa, IIIa
and IV (North Sea) and the fisheries, including recreational fisheries, exploiting those stocks.
Demersal stocks shall cover those roundfish, flatfish and cartilaginous fish species, Norway lobster (Nephrops Norvegicus) and Northern
prawn (Pandalus borealis) that live at or near the bottom of the water column
The Commission may submit a proposal to amend the list covered by the definitions on the basis of scientific advice or a request from the
Member States concerned.
Restore and maintain fish stocks: Parliament recalled that the aim of this plan should be to help achieve the objectives of the Common
Fisheries Policy (CFP), in particular to restore and maintain fish stocks at biomass levels above those to achieve maximum sustainable yield
(MSY). The plan shall contribute to:
the implementation of the landing obligation for demersal stocks subject to catch limits;
the implementation and achievement of the socio-economic aspects of the CFP and contributing to the implementation of the
ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management by minimising the negative effects of fishing on the marine ecosystem;
the achievement of good environmental status and favourable conservation particularly for threatened habitats and protected species
including marine mammals and seabirds.
All actions taken under the plan should be based on the best available scientific advice meaning scientific advice which has been reviewed by
ICES or STECF and is supported by the most up-to-date data available.
Prohibited species: group 6 in the Commission proposal refers to the list of prohibited species as they currently appear in Article 12 of Council
Regulation (EU) 2017/127. Members suggested referring to a less flexible list by specifying the definition of prohibited species.
Targeted objectives: Parliament proposed:
fishing opportunities be fixed in such a way as to ensure that there is less than a 5 % probability of the spawning stock biomass falling
below the limit spawning stock biomass reference point (Blim);
that the Commission may urgently submit a proposal to revise the fishing mortality ranges set out in Annex I if it considers, on the
basis of the best scientific advice available, that these ranges are no longer in line with the objectives of the plan.
Measures of the multiannual plan based on the precautionary approach must guarantee a degree of conservation of the relevant stocks that is
at least comparable to exploitation rates in accordance with the maximum sustainable yield.
Fishing opportunities: when allocating the fishing opportunities available to them, Member States should take account of transparent and
objective criteria. In the case of joint management of stocks shared with third countries, Member States should allow the exchange of fishing
opportunities. Stocks managed jointly with third countries are to be managed wherever possible with joint agreements.
Impact of recreational fishing: a new provision shall provide for the review of available data on recreational fishery catches to determine their

potential impact on the stocks of regulated species.
For those stocks for which recreational catches are considered to be significant, the Council shall, when setting fishing opportunities, take
account of recreational catches.
Technical measures: Members suggested that a specific chapter should be created to allow technical measures to be put in place in general to
achieve the targets for the maximum possible avoidance of and reduction of unwanted catches
The Commission may adopt delegated acts in respect of:
specifications of characteristics of fishing gears and rules governing their use, to ensure or improve selectivity, to reduce unwanted
catches or to minimise the negative impact on the ecosystem;
limitations or prohibitions on the use of certain fishing gears and on fishing activities, in certain areas or periods to protect spawning
fish, fish below the minimum conservation reference size or non-target fish species, or to minimise the negative impact on the
ecosystem;
the fixing of minimum conservation reference sizes for any of the stocks to which this Regulation applies, to ensure the protection of
juveniles of marine organisms.
The Commission shall be empowered to establish biologically sensitive protected areas.
