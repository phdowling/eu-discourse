2016/0047(NLE) - 18/02/2016 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to revise Decision 2008/376/EC in order to ensure a coherent framework for participation in both the Research Fund for Coal and
Steel (RFCS) Programme and Horizon 2020 Framework Programme in sectors relating to the coal and steel industry.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to
follow its opinion.
BACKGROUND: after the expiry of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) Treaty in 2012 and under a Protocol annexed to the EU
Treaties, the European Member States established the new Research Fund for Coal and Steel (RFCS) and transferred all remaining assets of
the (expired) ECSC to this new fund.
The RFCS Programme provides annually around EUR 50 million of R&D and Innovation funding to both coal and steel sectors (with a
distribution of 27.2 % for coal and 72.8 % for steel) bringing together industrial partners, SMEs, leading research centres and universities
across the European Union to develop knowledge and foster innovation. The Programme is funded by the EU general budget and is managed
by and under the responsibility of the Commission.

The legal basis laying down the management rules of the RFCS was adopted by the Council in 2003 and has already been revised in 2008. It
provides for systematic periodical reassessments of the programmes relevance and of the effectiveness of its management rules (multiannual
technical guidelines).
CONTENT: the purpose of this proposal is to amend the legal basis of the research programme dedicated to the Coal and Steel sectors after
the periodical assessment of its management rules with a view to implement the following objectives:
ensuring a transparent management of a programme funded by the EU general budget and under the responsibility of the
Commission with the implementation of the rules of the Commission concerning expert groups;
facilitating access to funding for beneficiaries with simplified rules and through a proportionate alignment with the rules of the general
research programme Horizon 2020 with which Coal and Steel stakeholders are familiar;
updating the provisions referred to in the legal basis concerning in particular comitology.
The proposed revision of the RFCS legal basis is focused on the management rules of the RFCS programme (chapter III) and aligns, as much
as possible the procedures and concepts used for H2020 to facilitate the participation of same beneficiaries to both programmes (RFCS and
H2020). In particular:
the different category of actors in a funded project (participant, subcontractor, third party), their eligibility and obligations are defined in
accordance with the definitions used in H2020 programme;
the H2020 appointment procedure for independent experts charged with the evaluation of proposals submitted applies for the
appointment of independent experts in the RFCS programme;
the possibility to charge as eligible costs an amount fixed by the Commission as Staff costs for SMEs owners and other natural
persons not receiving a salary is authorised.
In addition, the proposal:
introduced a clarification on the nature of the experts appointed by the Commission to attend the Advisory Groups and the Technical
Groups set up by the legal basis of the RFCS Programme is required to avoid any conflict of interests;
provides that the composition and tasks of the Advisory Groups and the composition and tasks of the Technical Groups should be
revised. The competencies of the Advisory Groups are focused on the management rules and procedures, the segregation between
Advisory and Technical groups is enhanced and the appointment procedure of their members is clarified.
The objectives and the scope of the Programme are unchanged.

2016/0047(NLE) - 30/11/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Industry, Research and Energy adopted the report by Jerzy BUZEK (EPP, PL) on the proposal for a Council decision
amending Decision 2008/376/EC on the adoption of the Research Programme of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel and on the
multiannual technical guidelines for this programme.
It recommended that Parliament adopt the following amendments to the Commission proposal:
Research projects: those research projects to which preference will be given include the following: projects on: (a) the impact on the
employment of workers and the local community of operations for mining; (b) the impact on the health and safety of workers and of the local
community of operations for mining.
Tasks of the Advisory Groups: the report stated that the Advisory Groups will advise the Commission on tasks that include assessment of
finalised projects, including further support measures to ensure their continuity and the long-term viability of coal and steel production in the
areas concerned. Advisory Groups shall act individually and shall not represent an individual stakeholder. They shall be active in the field
concerned and be aware of the industrial and sectoral priorities.
Appointment of independent and highly qualified experts: for the appointment of independent and highly qualified experts, the provisions set
out in Article 40 of Regulation (EU) No 1290/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council shall apply by analogy together with, for
expert groups as a whole, the Commission Decision of 30 May 2016 on establishing horizontal rules on the creation and operation of
Commission expert groups and a forthcoming European Parliament resolution on Control of the Register and composition of the Commissions
expert groups.

2016/0047(NLE) - 14/12/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted 562 votes to 103, with 45 abstentions (following the consultation procedure), a legislative resolution on the
proposal for a Council decision amending Decision 2008/376/EC on the adoption of the Research Programme of the Research Fund for Coal
and Steel and on the multiannual technical guidelines for this programme.
Parliament approved the Commission proposal subject to the following amendments:
Research projects: those research projects to which preference will be given include the following: projects on: (a) the impact on the
employment of workers and the local community; (b) the impact on the health and safety of workers and of the local community.
The resolution stressed that the working conditions in the coal and steel sectors are demanding and have often resulted in damage to the
health of workers and citizens.
Installations and companies should therefore respect all legal requirements on social responsibility, bring definitive solutions, and minimise the
social implications of transition or closure of installations. The social partners need to be consulted to the extent possible on issues relating to
social responsibility.
Tasks of the Advisory Groups: Members stated that the Advisory Groups will advise the Commission on tasks that include assessment of

finalised projects of coal and steel production in the areas concerned.
Advisory Groups shall act individually and shall not represent an individual stakeholder. They shall be active in the field concerned and be
aware of the industrial and sectoral priorities.
Technical Groups: Members urged the Commission to provide the maximum transparency possible, including publication of the agenda,
background documents, voting records and detailed minutes, including dissenting opinions in line with the recommendation of the European
Ombudsman.
Appointment of independent and highly qualified experts: for the appointment of independent and highly qualified experts, the provisions set
out in Article 40 of Regulation (EU) No 1290/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council shall apply by analogy together with, for
expert groups as a whole, the Commission Decision of 30 May 2016 on establishing horizontal rules on the creation and operation of
Commission expert groups and a forthcoming European Parliament resolution on Control of the Register and composition of the Commissions
expert groups.
