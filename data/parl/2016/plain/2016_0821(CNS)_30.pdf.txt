2016/0821(CNS) - 06/12/2016 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to entitle Finland, Slovenia, Romania, Poland, Sweden, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Slovakia and Hungary to continue to receive and
supply personal data for the purpose of automated searching of vehicle registration data (VRD).
PROPOSED ACT: Council Implementing Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to
follow its opinion.
BACKGROUND: Council Decision 2008/615/JHA on the stepping up of cross-border cooperation, particularly in combating terrorism and
cross-border crime, confers upon the Council implementing powers with a view to adopting measures necessary to implement that Decision, in
particular as regards the receipt and supply of personal data provided for under that Decision.
The supply of personal data provided for under that Decision may not take place until the general provisions on data protection have been
implemented in the national law of the territories of the Member States involved in such supply.
Council Decision 2008/616/JHA provides that the verification that the condition with respect to automated data exchange has been met is to be
done on the basis of an evaluation report based on: (i) a questionnaire; (ii) an evaluation visit and a pilot run.
The overall evaluation reports, summarising the results of the questionnaire, the evaluation visit and the pilot run concerning vehicle
registration data in each of these Member States, have been presented to the Council.
On the basis of these evaluation reports, Decisions 2010/559/EU, 2011/387/EU, 2011/547/EU, 2012/236/EU, 2012/664/EU, 2012/713/EU,
2013/230/EU, 2013/692/EU and 2014/264/EU authorised Finland, Slovenia, Romania, Poland, Sweden, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Slovakia and
Hungary to receive and supply personal data for the purposes of the automated searching of vehicle registration data.
In its judgment of 22 September 2016, the Court of Justice of the European Union annulled the above-mentioned Decisions on the grounds
that there were vitiated by procedural defects. With a view to ensuring the legal certainty of the receipt and supply of personal data with regard
to the Member States concerned, those Decisions should be replaced by the present draft Decision.
CONTENT: the proposed Council implementing Decision seeks, for the purpose of automated searching of vehicle registration data (VRD), to
authorise Finland, Slovenia, Romania, Poland, Sweden, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Slovakia and Hungary to continue to receive and supply personal
data for the purpose of automated searching of vehicle registration data (VRD) pursuant to Decision 2008/615/JHA.
Decisions 2010/559/EU, 2011/387/EU, 2011/547/EU, 2012/236/EU, 2012/664/EU, 2012/713/EU, 2013/230/EU, 2013/692/EU and
2014/264/EU cease to produce effects as from the date of entry into force of this Decision, without prejudice to the validity of automated data
exchange carried out pursuant to those Decisions by the Member States.
Member States which obtained personal data pursuant to these Decisions shall continue to be entitled to further process those data at national
level or between Member States for the purposes laid down in Article 26 of Decision 2008/615/JHA.
The United Kingdom and Ireland shall participate in the adoption of the proposed Decision.

2016/0821(CNS) - 28/03/2017 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading

The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs adopted, following the consultation procedure, the report by Filiz HYUSMENOVA
(ADLE, BG) on the draft Council implementing decision on the automated data exchange with regard to vehicle registration data in Finland,
Slovenia, Romania, Poland, Sweden, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Slovakia and Hungary and replacing Decisions 2010/559/EU, 2011/387/EU,
2011/547/EU, 2012/236/EU, 2012/664/EU, 2012/713/EU, 2013/230/EU, 2013/692/EU and 2014/264/EU.
The committee recommended the European Parliament to approve the Council draft.
The proposed Council implementing Decision seeks, for the purpose of automated searching of vehicle registration data (VRD), to authorise
Finland, Slovenia, Romania, Poland, Sweden, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Slovakia and Hungary to continue to receive and supply personal data for
the purpose of automated searching of vehicle registration data (VRD) pursuant to Decision 2008/615/JHA on the stepping up of cross-border
cooperation, particularly in combating terrorism and cross-border crime.

2016/0821(CNS) - 05/04/2017 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 602 votes to 75, with 22 abstentions, following the consultation procedure, a legislative resolution on the
draft Council implementing decision on the automated data exchange with regard to vehicle registration data in Finland, Slovenia, Romania,
Poland, Sweden, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Slovakia and Hungary and replacing Decisions 2010/559/EU, 2011/387/EU, 2011/547/EU, 2012/236/EU,
2012/664/EU, 2012/713/EU, 2013/230/EU, 2013/692/EU and 2014/264/EU.
The Council consulted Parliament pursuant to Article 39(1) of the Treaty on European Union, as amended by the Treaty of Amsterdam, and
Article 9 of Protocol No 36 on transitional provisions.
In line with its Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, Parliament approved the Council draft.

2016/0821(CNS) - 18/05/2017 Final act
PURPOSE: to authorise Finland, Slovenia, Romania, Poland, Sweden, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Slovakia and Hungary to continue to receive and
supply personal data for the purpose of automated searching of vehicle registration data (VRD).
NON LEGISLATIVE ACT: Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2017/947 on the automated data exchange with regard to vehicle registration
data in Finland, Slovenia, Romania, Poland, Sweden, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Slovakia and Hungary and replacing Decisions 2010/559/EU,
2011/387/EU, 2011/547/EU, 2012/236/EU, 2012/664/EU, 2012/713/EU, 2013/230/EU, 2013/692/EU and 2014/264/EU.
CONTENT: through this Council Implementing Decision, Finland, Slovenia, Romania, Poland, Sweden, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Slovakia and
Hungary remain authorised to continue to receive and supply personal data for the purpose of automated searching of vehicle registration data
(VRD).
To recall, Council Decision 2008/615/JAI on the stepping up of cross-border cooperation, particularly in combating terrorism and cross-border
crime, provides that the supply of personal data may not take place until the Member States involved in such supply have implemented in
national law the general provisions on data protection set out in that Decision.
The overall evaluation reports, summarising the results of the questionnaire, the evaluation visit and the pilot run concerning vehicle
registration data in each of these Member States, have been presented to the Council.
On the basis of these evaluation reports, Decisions 2010/559/EU, 2011/387/EU, 2011/547/EU, 2012/236/EU, 2012/664/EU, 2012/713/EU,
2013/230/EU, 2013/692/EU and 2014/264/EU authorised Finland, Slovenia, Romania, Poland, Sweden, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Slovakia and
Hungary to receive and supply personal data for the purposes of the automated searching of vehicle registration data.
In its judgment of 22 September 2016, the Court of Justice of the European Union annulled the above-mentioned Decisions on the grounds
that there were vitiated by procedural defects.
With a view to ensuring the legal certainty of the receipt and supply of personal data with regard to the Member States concerned, this
Decision replaces the Decisions annulled by the Court. The Member States that obtained personal data pursuant to these Decisions are
entitled to further process those data at national level or between Member States.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 3.6.2017. From that date, Decisions 2010/559/EU, 2011/387/EU, 2011/547/EU, 2012/236/EU, 2012/664/EU,
2012/713/EU, 2013/230/EU, 2013/692/EU and 2014/264/EU cease to have effect.
