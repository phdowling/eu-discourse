Summary

2016/2808(RSP) - 07/07/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a resolution on Bahrain.
The text adopted in plenary was adopted by the EPP, S&D, ECR, ALDE, Greens/EFA and EFDD groups.
Parliament recalled that over the past month, Bahrain has intensified its campaign of repression and persecution of human rights defenders
and political opposition. The Bahraini authorities continue to use revocation of citizenship as a means of political repression.
Against this background, Members called for an end to all acts of violence, harassment and intimidation, including at judicial level, and to the
censorship of human rights defenders, political opponents, peaceful protesters and civil society actors by state authorities and the security
forces and services.
They condemned the imposition of travel bans on the delegation of human rights activists on their way to attend the 32nd session of the UN
Human Rights Council in Geneva.
Parliament reminded the Bahraini Government of its responsibility to ensure the security and safety of all citizens irrespective of their political
views, affiliation or confession.
It insisted on an immediate halt to the suppression of different political opinions in the country and the repression of their leading
representatives, regardless of their political or religious affiliation.
It expressed particular concern regarding the misuse of anti-terrorism laws in Bahrain and, especially, the revocation of nationality as a means
of political pressure and punishment.
It called on the Bahraini authorities to ensure the full implementation of the 2002 Constitution and to respect the human rights and fundamental
freedoms guaranteed therein, as well as the international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by Bahrain. It reminded
the Bahraini authorities that Article 15 of the Convention Against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
prohibits the use of any statement made as a result of torture as evidence in any proceedings .
Further, Parliament expressed its concern about Bahrains return to the death sentence and calls for the reintroduction of the moratorium on
the death penalty.
While noting the Government of Bahrains ongoing efforts to reform the countrys penal code and legal procedures, Parliament urged the
Government of Bahrain to uphold international standards on the right to a fair trial.
The Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the European External Action
Service and the Member States are called upon to persist in raising concerns about attacks against the freedoms of expression, association
and peaceful assembly in Bahrain.
Parliament also condemned the agreements on trade in weapons and technologies used to violate human rights and called for the prohibition
of exports of tear gas and anti-riot equipment until such time as investigations have been carried out into the inappropriate use thereof and the
perpetrators have been identified and brought before the courts.
Lastly, it encouraged the establishment of an EU-Bahrain human rights working group, but noted that an EU-Bahrain human rights dialogue is
no substitute for a thorough dialogue between government, opposition and civil society in Bahrain itself.
