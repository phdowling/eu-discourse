2016/2038(INI) - 29/06/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Special Committee on Tax Rulings and Other Measures Similar in Nature or Effect (TAXE 2) adopted the report by Jeppe KOFOD (S&D,
DK) and Michael THEURER (ADLE, DE) on tax rulings and other measures similar in nature or effect.
The Panama Papers and Lux Leaks revelations have shown the urgent need for the EU and its Member States to fight tax evasion, tax
avoidance and aggressive tax planning, and to act for increased cooperation and transparency, particularly by ensuring that corporate taxes
are paid where value is created, not only among Member States, but also globally.
Recalling that the scale of tax evasion and avoidance is estimated by the Commission to be up to EUR 1 trillion a year, while the OECD
estimates the revenue loss at global level to be between 4 % and 10 % of all corporate income tax revenue, the Special Committee suggested
that Parliament reiterated the conclusions of its resolution of 25 November 2015 and of its resolution of 16 December 2015.
Follow-up by the Commission and Member States: Members regretted the fact that to date 14 Member States still have no controlled foreign
company rules to prevent aggressive tax planning and that 25 have no rules to counter the mismatching tax qualification of a local company by
another state. They called on Member States and the Commission to adopt further legislative proposals on corporate tax avoidance.
Members considered that the Directive on Administrative Cooperation, having undergone two consecutive ad hoc modifications, on automatic
exchange on tax rulings and on Country-by-Country Reporting, should now be reviewed in its entirety, particularly but not only in order to
reduce and eventually eliminate the current exceptions to the principle of exchange of information. They urged the Commission to come
forward with a proposal for a common corporate consolidated tax base (CCCTB) before the end of 2016, which would provide a
comprehensive solution for dealing with harmful tax practices within the Union.
Blacklist and concrete sanctions for uncooperative jurisdictions and withholding tax: the Commission was asked to come up with a common
Union definition and a blacklist of tax havens, based on sound, transparent and objective criteria and including implementation of OECD
recommendations. An escalation procedure, starting with a constructive dialogue with the jurisdiction where shortcomings have been
identified, needed to be foreseen prior to the listing.
Members also called for a concrete Union regulatory framework for sanctions against the blacklisted uncooperative jurisdictions, including the
possibility of reviewing and, in the last resort, suspending free trade agreements, suspending double taxation agreements and prohibiting
access to Union funds. Sanctions should also be applied to companies, banks, and accountancy and law firms and to tax advisers proven to
be involved in illegal, harmful or wrongful activities.
The Commission should prepare binding legislation banning all EU institutions from opening accounts or operating in the jurisdictions included
in the common Union list of uncooperative jurisdictions. It should also present a legislative proposal for a EU-wide withholding tax, to be
operated by the Member States, in order to ensure that profits generated within the Union are taxed at least once before leaving it. For their
parts, Member States should renegotiate their bilateral tax treaties with third countries by means of a multilateral instrument, in order to
introduce sufficiently robust anti-abuse clauses and thus prevent treaty shopping.
Patent, knowledge and R&D boxes: Members noted that to date patent, knowledge and R&D boxes have not proven as effective in fostering
innovation in the Union as they should have. They are, instead, used by multinationals for profit shifting through aggressive tax planning

schemes.
The Commission was asked to put forward proposals for binding Union legislation on patent boxes, building on and addressing the
weaknesses of the OECD Modified Nexus Approach, in order to prohibit the misuse of patent boxes for tax avoidance purposes.
Banks, tax advisers and intermediaries: Members regretted deeply that some banks, tax advisers, law and accounting firms and other
intermediaries have been instrumental and have played a key role in designing aggressive tax planning schemes for their clients, and have
also assisted national governments in designing their tax codes and laws, creating a significant conflict of interest. They called on the
Commission to come forward with a Union Code of Conduct for all advising services to provide for situations of potential conflicts of interest to
be clearly disclosed.
Member States were asked to establish effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions, including criminal sanctions, on company managers
involved in tax evasion, as well as the possibility of revoking business licences for professionals and companies proved to be involved in
designing, advising on the use of, or utilising illegal tax planning and evasion schemes;
The Commission was asked explore the feasibility of introducing proportional financial liability for tax advisers engaged in unlawful tax
practices. It was also asked to come forward with a legislative proposal introducing a mandatory disclosure requirement for banks, tax advisers
and other intermediaries concerning complex structures and special services that are linked to jurisdictions included on the common EU list of
tax havens.
Other recommendations: the Special Committee called for, inter alia:
a proposal from the Commission of a clear legal framework to guarantee the effective protection of whistle-blowers, as well as of
journalists and other persons connected with the press who aid and facilitate them;
an improvement in the transparency and effectiveness of the working methods of the Code of Conduct Group, given that only a limited
number of new documents have been made available for in camera consultation by MEPs, and that the Commission was unable to
keep all records of the documents distributed;
the creation of a new Union Tax Policy Coherence and Coordination Centre within the structure of the Commission, to safeguard the
proper and coherent functioning of the single market and the implementation of international standards;
improved cooperation between the Union, the G20, the OECD and the UN to cooperate further to promote global guidelines that will
also be beneficial to developing countries;
inclusion in all trade and partnership agreements of good governance clauses, including efforts to effectively implement global
automatic exchange of information standards;
a global assets register of all assets held by individuals, companies and all entities such as trusts and foundations, to which tax
authorities would have full access and which would include appropriate safeguards to protect the confidentiality of the information
retained therein;
a common and comprehensive EU/US approach on the implementation of OECD standards and on beneficial ownership;
encouraging the potential of digital solutions for effective tax collection in gathering tax data directly from operations in the sharing
economy and in lowering the overall workload of tax authorities in Member States.
Members called on the Council to fully take advantage of the consultation procedure with Parliament, which in particular means waiting for
input from Parliament before reaching a political agreement and striving to take on board Parliament´s position.

2016/2038(INI) - 06/07/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 514 votes to 68 with 125 abstentions, a resolution on tax rulings and other measures similar in nature or
effect, following the work of The Special Committee on Tax Rulings and Other Measures Similar in Nature or Effect (TAXE 2).
The Panama Papers and Lux Leaks revelations have shown the urgent need for the EU and its Member States to fight tax evasion, tax
avoidance and aggressive tax planning, and to act for increased cooperation and transparency, particularly by ensuring that corporate taxes
are paid where value is created, not only among Member States, but also globally. Offshore wealth is estimated to be approximately USD 10
trillion.
Recalling that the scale of tax evasion and avoidance is estimated by the Commission to be up to EUR 1 trillion a year, while the OECD
estimates the revenue loss at global level to be between 4 % and 10 % of all corporate income tax revenue, Parliament reiterated the
conclusions of its resolution of 25 November 2015 and of its resolution of 16 December 2015.
Follow-up by the Commission and Member States: regretting the fact that to date 14 Member States still have no controlled foreign company
rules to prevent aggressive tax planning and that to date not one Member State has called for a ban on aggressive tax planning structures,
Parliament called on Member States and the Commission to adopt further legislative proposals on corporate tax avoidance.
Parliament:
considered that the Directive on Administrative Cooperation, having undergone two consecutive ad hoc modifications, on automatic
exchange on tax rulings and on Country-by-Country Reporting, should now be reviewed in its entirety, particularly but not only in order
to reduce and eventually eliminate the current exceptions to the principle of exchange of information;
reiterated its position that multinational undertakings ought to publish in a clear and comprehensible manner in their balance sheets,
for each Member State and each third country where they are established, a series of items of information, including pre-tax profits or
losses, tax on profits or losses, number of employees, and operations performed; underlines the importance of making this information
available to the public, possibly in the form of a central EU register;
urged the Commission to come forward with a proposal for a common corporate consolidated tax base (CCCTB) before the end of
2016, which would provide a comprehensive solution for dealing with harmful tax practices within the Union, bearing in mind that 70 %
of all profit shifting is done through transfer pricing.
Blacklist and concrete sanctions for uncooperative jurisdictions and withholding tax: the Commission was asked to come up as soon as
possible with a common Union definition and a blacklist of tax havens, based on sound, transparent and objective criteria and including
implementation of OECD recommendations, tax transparency measures, and Automatic Exchange of Information standards. An escalation

procedure, starting with a constructive dialogue with the jurisdiction where shortcomings have been identified, needed to be foreseen prior to
the listing.
Parliament also called for:
a concrete Union regulatory framework for sanctions against the blacklisted uncooperative jurisdictions, including the possibility of
reviewing and, in the last resort, suspending free trade agreements, suspending double taxation agreements and prohibiting access to
Union funds. Sanctions should also be applied to companies, banks, and accountancy and law firms and to tax advisers proven to be
involved in wrongful activities in these countries and territories;
presentation by the Commission of a legislative proposal for an EU-wide withholding tax, to be operated by the Member States, in
order to ensure that profits generated within the Union are taxed at least once before leaving it; such a proposal should include a
refund system to prevent double taxation;
For their parts, Member States should renegotiate their bilateral tax treaties with third countries by means of a multilateral instrument, in order
to introduce sufficiently robust anti-abuse clauses and thus prevent treaty shopping, including a distribution of taxation rights between source
and resident countries reflective of economic substance and an appropriate definition of permanent establishment.
Patent, knowledge and R&D boxes: Members noted that to date patent, knowledge and R&D boxes have not proven as effective in fostering
innovation in the Union, as they should have. They are, instead, used by multinationals for profit shifting through aggressive tax planning
schemes.
The Commission was asked to put forward proposals for binding Union legislation on patent boxes, building on and addressing the
weaknesses of the OECD Modified Nexus Approach, in order to prohibit the misuse of patent boxes for tax avoidance purposes.
Banks, tax advisers and intermediaries: Parliament regretted deeply that some banks, tax advisers, law and accounting firms and other
intermediaries have been instrumental and have played a key role in designing aggressive tax planning schemes for their clients, and have
also assisted national governments in designing their tax codes and laws, creating a significant conflict of interest.
The Commission was asked to:
come forward with a Union Code of Conduct for all advising services to provide for situations of potential conflicts of interest to be
clearly disclosed;
strengthen the requirements on banks to report to the Member States tax authorities transfers to and from jurisdictions included on the
common Union list of tax havens and uncooperative tax jurisdictions;
analyse the possibility of introducing proportional financial liability for banks and financial institutions facilitating transfers to known tax
havens;
come forward with a legislative proposal introducing a mandatory disclosure requirement for banks, tax advisers and other
intermediaries concerning complex structures and special services that are linked to jurisdictions included on the common EU list of
tax havens.
Parliament called on Member States to establish effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions, including criminal sanctions, on company
managers involved in tax evasion, as well as the possibility of revoking business licences for professionals and companies proved to be
involved in designing, advising on the use of, or utilising illegal tax planning and evasion schemes.
Other recommendations: Parliament called for, inter alia:
·

a proposal from the Commission of a clear legal framework to guarantee the effective protection of whistle-blowers, as well as of
journalists and other persons connected with the press who aid and facilitate them;

·

an improvement in the transparency and effectiveness of the working methods of the Code of Conduct Group, given that only a
limited number of new documents have been made available for in camera consultation by MEPs, and that the Commission was
unable to keep all records of the documents distributed;

·

granting Parliament permanent, access to the room documents and minutes of the Council groups working on tax matters, including
the Code of Conduct on Business Taxation, the High Level Working Group and the Working Party on Tax Questions;

·

the creation of a new Union Tax Policy Coherence and Coordination Centre within the structure of the Commission, to safeguard the
proper and coherent functioning of the single market and the implementation of international standards;

·

improved cooperation between the Union, the G20, the OECD and the UN to cooperate further to promote global guidelines that will
also be beneficial to developing countries; Member States should revise their current legislation on the protection of whistle-blowers
by including the possibility of abstention from prosecution in cases in which whistle-blowers have acted in the public interest;
inclusion in all trade and partnership agreements good governance clauses referring in particular to compliance with the relevant
OECD recommendations pertaining to the field of taxation and ensuring that trade and partnership agreements cannot be misused by
companies or intermediaries to avoid or evade taxes or launder revenues from illegal activities;
the establishment of a public Union register of beneficial ownership, including harmonised standards of access to beneficial ownership
information;
a study on the feasibility of a global register of all financial assets held by individuals, companies and all entities such as trusts and
foundations, to which tax authorities would have full access and which would include appropriate safeguards to protect the
confidentiality of the information retained therein;
a common and comprehensive EU/US approach on the implementation of OECD standards and on beneficial ownership;
encouraging the potential of digital solutions for effective tax collection in gathering tax data directly from operations in the sharing
economy and in lowering the overall workload of tax authorities in Member States.

Parliament called on all national parliaments to work together to ensure proper control and coherence of tax systems between Member States.
The Council was asked to fully take advantage of the consultation procedure with Parliament, which in particular means waiting for input from
Parliament before reaching a political agreement and striving to take on board Parliament´s position
