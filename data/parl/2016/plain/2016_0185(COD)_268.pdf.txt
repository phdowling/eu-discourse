2016/0185(COD) - 15/06/2016 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to regulate the functioning of national wholesale roaming markets in order to abolish retail roaming surcharges by 15 June 2017.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: abolishing retail roaming surcharges is an essential step towards ensuring that telecom rules support the establishment and
functioning of a digital single market across the Union. This target was also stressed in the Digital Single Market Strategy set out by the
Commission.
In 2015, the European Parliament and the Council adopted Regulation (EU) 2015/2120, which entered into force on 29 November 2015 and
amended Regulation (EU) No 531/2012 (the Roaming Regulation).
Regulation (EU) 2015/2120 requires retail roaming surcharges to be abolished in the Union from 15 June 2017 , subject to fair usage of
roaming services and the possibility of applying a sustainability derogation mechanism of the abolition of retail roaming charges. These new
rules for retail roaming services in the Union are referred to as the roam-like-at-home (RLAH) rule.
While necessary, the regulation at retail level alone is not sufficient to implement RLAH. National wholesale roaming markets need to be
competitive and deliver wholesale roaming prices that enable operators to sustainably offer retail roaming services without any additional
charges.
In this regard, the Commission has undertaken a review of the wholesale roaming market, with a view to assessing measures necessary to
enable the abolition of retail roaming surcharges from 15 June 2017.
The review shows in particular that wholesale roaming markets do not always function properly. The impact of these market failures on the
functioning of wholesale markets results in prices substantially above estimated costs, in particular for data.
Another conclusion of the review is that it is not possible to anticipate with certainty the impact of the future RLAH obligation, and in particular
the expected increase of roaming traffic, on competition on national wholesale roaming markets.
In light of the problems identified, the Commission considers that the current measures applicable on the wholesale roaming markets should
be amended to ensure that the level of wholesale roaming charges enables the sustainable provision of RLAH in the Union.
IMPACT ASSESSMENT: amongst the 4 options considered, the preferred option consisted of setting EU-wide wholesale roaming charges
caps at a lower level than today. Under this option, legislation would reduce the current wholesale roaming charges caps and would also
ensure that RLAH enters into force.
CONTENT: this proposal for a regulation is meant to complete the rules on roaming, in particular with regard to wholesale roaming markets , in
order to abolish retail roaming surcharges by 15 June 2017 without distorting the domestic visited and home markets.
The Commission proposed to make the following amendments to the Roaming Regulation:
add the possibility for the parties to a wholesale agreement to waive the application of maximum wholesale caps provided in Articles 7,
9 and 12 of the Roaming Regulation;
reduce the current wholesale roaming charges caps to EUR 0.04 per minutes of call made, EUR 0,01 per SMS and EUR 0,0085 per
megabyte of data transmitted;
ensure consultation of the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications ( BEREC) in disputes concerning inputs
necessary for the provision of regulated wholesale roaming services;
ensure that the Commission submits a report to the European Parliament and the Council every two years after 15 June 2017;
clarify BERECs data-gathering powers: BEREC shall regularly collect data from national regulatory authorities on developments in
retail and wholesale charges for regulated voice, SMS and data roaming services, including wholesale charges applied for balanced
and unbalanced roaming traffic respectively.

2016/0185(COD) - 07/12/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading

The Committee on Industry, Research and Energy adopted the report by Miapetra KUMPULA-NATRI (S&D, FI) on the proposal for a
regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) No 531/2012 as regards rules for wholesale roaming
markets.
The committee recommended that Parliament?s position adopted in first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure should amend the
Commission proposal as follows:
Wholesale roaming access: the Commission proposal stated that mobile network operators may refuse requests for wholesale roaming access
only on the basis of objective criteria and after obtaining authorisation from their national regulatory authority. Members suggested that the
national regulatory authority concerned inform the Commission of any application for authorisation and of the objectively justified reasons
therefor. The Commission shall make information concerning such applications available to the public, subject to the duty of confidentiality.
Complaints: undertakings that have requested wholesale roaming access may submit complaints to the national regulatory authorities
concerned. The national regulatory authorities shall accept or reject such complaints within one month of receipt, providing reasons for their
decision. The national regulatory authorities shall inform the Commission of such complaints and the corresponding decisions, and the
Commission shall make them available to the public.
Wholesale charges for the making of regulated roaming calls: the average wholesale charge that the visited network operator may levy on the
roaming provider for the provision of a regulated roaming call originating on that visited network, shall not exceed a safeguard limit of
EUR 0.03 per minute as of 15 June 2017 and shall remain at EUR 0.03 until 30 June 2022 (the European Commission proposed a ceiling of
EUR 0.04 per minute).
Wholesale charges for regulated data roaming services: Members proposed to change the units used for data from megabytes to gigabytes
(1024 MB).
With effect from 15 June 2017, the average wholesale charge shall not exceed a safeguard limit of EUR 4 per gigabyte of data transmitted.
The safeguard limit shall, on 1 July 2018, decrease to EUR 3 per gigabyte of data transmitted, on 1 July 2019 to EUR 2 per gigabyte of data
transmitted, and on 1 July 2020, to EUR 1 per gigabyte of data transmitted. It shall remain at EUR 1 per gigabyte of data transmitted until 30
June 2022.
Dispute resolution: disputes between visited network operators and other operators on instances of unfair competition consisting in substance
of an offer from a non-domestic operator based on permanent roaming may be referred to the competent national regulatory authority.
In this case, the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) shall, in its opinion, make an overall assessment over
a significant period of all factual elements characterising the activities carried out by the non-domestic operator in the Member State in which it
is established and, on a proportional and comparative basis, in the Member State visited.
Review clause: the Commission proposes a review of price caps every two years after 15 June 2017. Members proposed that the Commission
submit an interim report on the implementation of the abolition of retail roaming surcharges by 15 December 2018. Furthermore, and after
consulting BEREC, the Commission shall submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council by 15 December 2019 and every two
years thereafter, accompanied, if appropriate, by a legislative proposal to amend the wholesale charges for regulated roaming services laid
down in this Regulation.
In its biennial report, the Commission should, in particular, assess whether "roam-like-at-home' (RLAH) has any impact on the evolution of
retail prices and, in particular, the range of tariff plans available on the retail market.

2016/0185(COD) - 06/04/2017 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 549 votes to 27, with 50 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) No 531/2012 as regards rules for wholesale roaming markets.
Parliaments position adopted in first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure amended the Commission proposal as follows:
Wholesale charges for the making of regulated roaming calls: with effect from 15 June 2017, the average wholesale charge that the visited
network operator may levy on the roaming provider for the provision of a regulated roaming call originating on that visited network, inclusive,
among others, of origination, transit and termination costs, shall not exceed a safeguard limit of EUR 0.032 per minute. That maximum
wholesale charge shall remain at EUR 0.032 until 30 June 2022.
Wholesale charges for regulated data roaming services: in order to take account of the increased usage of data services and the reduction in
cost per unit of data transmitted, the maximum wholesale charge for regulated data roaming services should decrease each year and should
be set in euro per gigabytes where a gigabyte is equal to 1 000 megabytes.
With effect from 15 June 2017, the average wholesale charge that the visited network operator may levy on the roaming provider for the
provision of regulated data roaming services by means of that visited network shall not exceed a safeguard limit of EUR 7.70 per gigabyte of
data transmitted. That maximum wholesale charge shall decrease to EUR 6.00 per gigabyte on 1 January 2018, to EUR 4.50 per gigabyte on
1 January 2019, to EUR 3.50 per gigabyte on 1 January 2020, to EUR 3.00 per gigabyte on 1 January 2021 and to EUR 2.50 per gigabyte on
1 January 2022. It shall remain at EUR 2.50 per gigabyte of data transmitted until 30 June 2022.
Conditions for wholesale access to roaming services: when included in a reference offer, these conditions should include specific measures
that the operator of the visited network may take to prevent permanent roaming or abnormal use or abusive use of wholesale roaming access,
as well as the objective criteria on the basis of which such measures should be taken.
The reference offer may provide for the possibility to terminate a wholesale roaming agreement where the visited network operator has
established that, based on objective criteria, permanent roaming by a significant share of the roaming provider's customers or anomalous or
abusive use of wholesale roaming access is taking place, and has informed the home network operator accordingly.
The visited network operator may terminate the wholesale roaming agreement unilaterally on grounds of permanent roaming or anomalous or
abusive use of wholesale roaming access only upon the prior authorisation of the visited network operators national regulatory authority.

The national regulatory authorities of the visited network operator and of the home network operator may each request BEREC to adopt an
opinion with regard to the action to be taken in accordance with this Regulation. BEREC shall adopt its opinion within one month of receipt of
such a request.
Review clause: the Commission proposes a review of price caps every two years after 15 June 2017. Members proposed that the Commission
submit an interim report on the implementation of the abolition of retail roaming surcharges by 15 December 2018. Furthermore, and after
consulting BEREC, the Commission shall submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council by 15 December 2019 and every two
years thereafter, accompanied, if appropriate, by a legislative proposal to amend the wholesale charges for regulated roaming services laid
down in this Regulation.
In its biennial report, the Commission should, in particular, assess whether "roam-like-at-home' (RLAH) has any impact on the evolution of
retail prices and, in particular, the range of tariff plans available on the retail market.
The Commissions biennial reports should, in particular: (i) analyse the extent to which exceptional retail roaming surcharges have been
authorised by national regulatory authorities; (ii) the ability of home network operators to sustain their domestic charging models and the ability
of visited network operators to recover the efficiently incurred costs of providing regulated wholesale roaming services.
BEREC should report regularly on the relationship between retail prices, wholesale charges and wholesale costs for roaming services.

2016/0185(COD) - 17/05/2017 Final act
PURPOSE: to regulate the functioning of national wholesale roaming markets in order to abolish retail roaming surcharges by 15 June 2017.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Regulation (EU) 2017/920 of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) No 531/2012 as
regards rules for wholesale roaming markets.
CONTENT: this Regulation amends Regulation (EU) No 531/2012 by introducing rules which limit the amount that operators may charge
between themselves to authorize roaming throughout Europe.
The reform of the wholesale market makes it possible, as from 15 June 2017, to 'roaming national tariffs', i.e. the removal of roaming charges
on the retail market for consumers who live in Europe and travel to other EU countries.
Caps for the wholesale supply of roaming services:
With effect from 15 June 2017,
the average wholesale charge that the visited network operator may levy on the roaming provider for the provision of a regulated
roaming call shall not exceed a safeguard limit of EUR 0.032 per minute. That maximum wholesale charge shall remain at EUR 0.032
until 30 June 2022;
the average wholesale charge that the visited network operator may levy on the roaming provider for the provision of a regulated
roaming SMS message originating on that visited network shall not exceed a safeguard limit of EUR 0.01 per SMS message and shall
remain at EUR 0.01 until 30 June 2022;
the average wholesale charge that the visited network operator may levy on the roaming provider for the provision of regulated data
roaming services by means of that visited network shall not exceed a safeguard limit of EUR 7.70 per gigabyte of data transmitted.
That maximum wholesale charge shall decrease to EUR 6.00 per gigabyte on 1 January 2018, to EUR 4.50 per gigabyte on 1 January
2019, to EUR 3.50 per gigabyte on 1 January 2020, to EUR 3.00 per gigabyte on 1 January 2021 and to EUR 2.50 per gigabyte on 1
January 2022. It shall remain at EUR 2.50 per gigabyte of data transmitted until 30 June 2022
Conditions for wholesale access to roaming services: where specified in a reference offer, such conditions shall include the specific measures
that the visited network operator may take to prevent permanent roaming or anomalous or abusive use of wholesale roaming access as well
as the objective criteria on the basis of which such measures may be taken.
Disputes between visited network operators and other operators on rates applied to inputs necessary for the provision of regulated wholesale
roaming services may be referred to the competent national regulatory authority or authorities. In such a case, the competent national
regulatory authority or authorities may consult Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) about the action to be
taken to resolve the dispute. Where BEREC has been consulted, the competent national regulatory authority or authorities shall await
BERECs opinion before taking action to resolve the dispute.
Review: the Commission shall submit biennial reports on how the rules are working, and if necessary, propose new caps. The first report shall
be submitted by 15 December 2019.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 12.6.2017.
The rules on caps for the wholesale supply of roaming services shall apply from 15.6.2017.
