Summary

The European Parliament adopted by 65 votes to 2, with 10 abstentions, a resolution on North Korea.
The text adopted in plenary was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ECR, ALDE, Greens/EFA and EFDD groups.
Parliament strongly condemned the fourth nuclear test of 6 January 2016 as an unnecessary and dangerous provocation as well as a violation
of the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and a serious threat to peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula and the North East Asian
region. It called supported meaningful and effective sanctions following the recent nuclear test to be decided upon by the international
community.
The resolution urged the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea (DPRK) to:
refrain from further provocative actions by abandoning its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes in a complete, verifiable and
irreversible manner,
cease all related activities and to comply immediately with all its international obligations, including the UN Security Council and IAEA
Board of Governors resolutions as well as other international disarmament and non-proliferation norms;
sign and ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty without delay.
Diplomatic solution: Parliament affirmed its desire for a diplomatic and political solution to the DPRK nuclear issue. It reiterated its support for
the Six-Party Talks and called for their resumption, urging the DPRK to reengage constructively with the international community.
Parliament is convinced that the time has come for the international community to take concrete action to end the perpetrators impunity. Those
most responsible for the crimes should be held accountable and brought before the International Criminal Court and be subjected to targeted
sanctions.
Chinas role: Members called on the Chinese Government to:
exert its increased influence and political and economic leverage over the DPRK to ensure that the situation does not escalate further;
take all the necessary steps, in cooperation with the international community, in order to restore peace and stability on the Korean
Peninsula;
not to deny North Korean refugees who cross the border into China their right to seek asylum or to forcibly return them to North Korea.
Human Rights and humanitarian situation: strongly condemning the systematic and large-scale use of the death penalty in the DPRK,
Parliament called on the Government of the DPRK to:
end immediately its use of the systematic suppression of human rights as a political tool to control and monitor its own population;
put an end to extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances, to release political prisoners and to allow its citizens to travel freely,
both within and outside the country;
allow free expression and press freedom for national and international media, and to allow its citizens uncensored access to the
internet;
stop its State-sponsored forced labour programme;
ensure access for all citizens to food and humanitarian assistance on the basis of need, in accordance with humanitarian principle. In
this regard, the Commission should maintain existing humanitarian aid programmes and channels of communication with the DPRK
and to secure their safe delivery to the targeted parts of the population.
Lastly, believing that the EU has a constructive role to play through its critical engagement with the DPRK Government, Parliament called on
the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union to use the expert capacity of the Republic of Korea in formulating the
EUs strategy towards the DPRK.
