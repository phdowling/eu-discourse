2016/0145(COD) - 23/05/2016 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to present a proposal to repeal a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council defining characteristics for fishing
vessels.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EEC) No 2930/86 defining characteristics for fishing vessels has been substantially amended. Since
further amendments are to be made, that Regulation should be recast in the interests of clarity.
CONTENT: the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2930/86 of 22 September 1986 defining
characteristics for fishing vessels. The new Regulation will supersede the two acts incorporated in it, fully preserving the content of the acts
being codified. At the same time, it is also appropriate to make a substantive amendment to Article 5(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 2930/86, with
a view to delegating powers to the Commission for adapting the requirements for the determination of continuous engine power to technical
progress.
Therefore, the proposal is being presented in the form of a recast.
To recall, the proposed Regulation seeks to define the characteristics of fishing vessels laid down in this Regulation shall apply to all Union
rules concerning fisheries. The aim is use identical rules for determining the characteristics of fishing vessels in order to unify the conditions for
the pursuit of the activity in the Union.
The definitions laid down in this proposed Regulation should be based upon initiatives already taken by specialist international organisations.
They concern the characteristics of fishing vessels, such as length, breadth, tonnage, date of entry into service and engine power.

2016/0145(COD) - 08/12/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Fisheries adopted the report by Werner KUHN (EPP, DE) on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and
of the Council defining characteristics for fishing vessels (recast).
The committee recommended that the European Parliament adopt its position at first reading hereinafter set out, taking into account the
recommendations of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission. It has,
however, submitted amendments to the proposal for a recast.
Accordingly, Members recommended:
using identical rules for determining the characteristics of fishing vessels, which shall be in line with the standards of the common
fisheries policy, in order to unify the conditions for the pursuit of the activity in the Union;
taking account of the United Nations Convention on Fishing and Conservation of the Living Resources of the High Seas, signed in
Geneva on 29 April 1958.
For larger fishing vessels exceeding 15 meters, a greater expansion of vessel characterisation to include cargo and fuel capacity, processing
ability and output is desirable.
With regard to engine power, the Commission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts in order to adapt the reference to the relevant
ISO International Standard to technical progress. The power to adopt delegated acts should be conferred on the Commission for a period of
five years from the date of entry into force of the Regulation. The delegation of power should be tacitly extended for periods of an identical
duration, unless the European Parliament or the Council opposes such extension not later than three months before the end of each period.
Lastly, Members proposed adding a recital referring to Parliaments resolution of 22 November 2012 on small-scale coastal fishing, artisanal
fishing and the reform of the common fisheries policy, which called for a legal definition regarding the characteristics of large-scale and
small-scale fisheries in order to legally distinguish them from one another.

2016/0145(COD) - 04/04/2017 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 529 votes to 26, with 59 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council defining characteristics for fishing vessels (recast).
The European Parliaments position adopted at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure takes into account recommendations of
the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
The proposed Regulation consists of a recast of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2930/86. It aims to establish the definitions of the characteristics
of fishing vessels which apply to all EU fisheries regulations. The definitions concern the characteristics of fishing vessels, such as length,
breadth, tonnage, date of entry into service and engine power.
The definitions laid down in this proposed Regulation should be based upon initiatives already taken by specialist international organisations.
They shall take into account the United Nations Convention on Fishing and Conservation of the Living Resources of the High Seas, signed in
Geneva on 29 April 1958, the International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, signed in London on 23 June 1969 and the
International Convention for the Safety of Fishing Vessels, signed in Torremolinos on 2 April 1977.
The Commission would have the power to adopt delegated acts in order to adapt the reference to the relevant ISO International Standards
setting out the requirements for the determination of the continuous engine power to technical progress.

2016/0145(COD) - 14/06/2017 Final act
PURPOSE: to set out the definitions of characteristics of fishing vessels that shall apply to all Union rules concerning fisheries.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Regulation (EU) 2017/1130 of the European Parliament and of the Council defining characteristics for fishing vessels.
CONTENT: the new rules repeal and recast Council Regulation No 2930/86 in line with the European Union's commitment to simplifying and
clarifying EU law.
The new Regulation establishes the definitions of characteristics of fishing vessels that shall apply to all Union rules concerning fisheries . The
definitions relate to characteristics of fishing vessels such as the length, the breadth, the tonnage, engine power, and the date of entry into
service.
The definitions laid down in the Regulation take account of:
·

the United Nations Convention on Fishing and Conservation of the Living Resources of the High Seas, signed in Geneva on 29 April
1958;

·

the International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, signed in London on 23 June 1969;

·

the International Convention for the Safety of Fishing Vessels, signed in Torremolinos on 2 April 1977.

ENTRY INTO FORCE: 20.7.2017.
DELEGATED ACTS: the Commission may adopt delegated acts in order to adapt the reference to the relevant ISO International Standard
setting out the requirements for the determination of the continuous engine power to technical progress. The power to adopt such acts is
conferred on the Commission for a period of five years (renewable) from 20 July 2017 . The European Parliament or the Council have the right
to object to a delegated act within two months (which may be extended by two months) from the date of notification of the act.
