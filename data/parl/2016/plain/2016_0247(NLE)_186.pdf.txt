2016/0247(NLE) - 12/08/2016 Initial legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude, on behalf of the European Union, an Agreement between the European Union and the Principality of Liechtenstein on
supplementary rules in relation to the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa, as part of the Internal Security Fund for the
period 2014 to 2020.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 515/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council, as part of the Internal Security Fund, the
instrument for financial support for external borders and visa (ISF Borders and Visa) for the period 2014 to 2020, as well as Regulation (EU)
No 514/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down general provisions on the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund
and on the instrument for financial support for police cooperation, preventing and combating crime, and crisis management became applicable
as of 1 January 2014.
The purpose of the ISF-Borders and Visa is to establish a solidarity mechanism binding the participating states by the same European rules on
the control of external borders in each other's interests and on each other's behalf. The instrument will serve to accomplish a key objective of
the Schengen acquis, namely to share responsibility for an efficient, high and uniform level of control at the external borders.
Regulation (EU) No 515/2014 provides that the countries associated with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen
acquis participate in the instrument in accordance with its provisions and that arrangements are to be concluded on their financial contributions
and the supplementary rules necessary for such participation, including provisions ensuring the protection of the Union's financial interests and
the power of audit of the Court of Auditors.
The aim of the draft Agreement with Liechtenstein (the associated country) is to establish the arrangements referred to in Article 5(7) of
Regulation (EU) No 515/2014 and to enable the Commission to assume ultimate responsibility for implementation of the budget of the

instrument in this associated country and determine this country's contribution to the Union budget in respect of this instrument.
CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approves the Agreement with Liechtenstein on supplementary rules in relation to the
instrument for financial support for external borders and visa, as part of the Internal Security Fund, for the period 2014 to 2020.
The draft Decision aims to conclude arrangements between the Union and Liechtenstein on this country's contribution to the instrument for
financial support for external borders and visa for the period 2014-2020 and on the supplementary rules necessary for this participation.
This proposal constitutes a development of elements of the Schengen acquis in which the United Kingdom and Ireland do not take part.
Denmark shall decide within a period of six months after the Council has decided on this Decision whether it will implement it in its national
law.

2016/0247(NLE) - 25/10/2016 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude, on behalf of the European Union, an Agreement between the European Union and Liechtenstein on supplementary
rules in relation to the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa, as part of the Internal Security Fund for the period 2014 to
2020.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND : the Agreement between the European Union and Liechtenstein on supplementary rules in relation to the instrument for
financial support for external borders and visa, as part of the Internal Security Fund, for the period 2014 to 2020 ("the Agreement") was signed
by the Commission , subject to its conclusion at a later date.
Regulation (EU) No 515/201[1] of the European Parliament and of the Council provides that the countries associated with the Schengen
acquis participate in the instrument in accordance with its provisions. Arrangements are to be concluded on their financial contributions and the
supplementary rules necessary for such participation, including provisions ensuring the protection of the Union's financial interests and the
powers of audit of the Court of Auditors.
CONTENT: the draft Decision proposes that the Council approve, on behalf of the EU, the Agreement with Liechtenstein on supplementary
rules in relation to the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa, as part of the Internal Security Fund, for the period 2014 to
2020.
Denmark, the United Kingdom and Ireland are not taking part in the adoption of the Decision and are not bound by it or subject to its
application.

2016/0247(NLE) - 03/02/2017 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs adopted the report by Josef WEIDENHOLZER (S&D, AT) on the draft Council
decision on the conclusion on behalf of the European Union of the Agreement between the European Union and the Principality of
Liechtenstein on supplementary rules in relation to the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa, as part of the Internal
Security Fund for the period 2014 to 2020.
The committee recommended the European Parliament to give its consent to the conclusion of the Agreement.
In the short justification accompanying the report, it is recalled that the Internal Security Fund, the instrument for financial support for external
borders and visa (ISF Borders and Visa) established by Regulation (EU) 515/2014, aims to ensure a high level of security in the Union while
facilitating legitimate travel, through a uniform and high level of control of the external border and the effective processing of Schengen visas.
The funding is around EUR 2.8 billion up to 2020.
Regulation (EU) 515/2014 stipulates that the countries associated with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen
acquis participate in the instrument in accordance with its provisions and that arrangements are to be concluded on their financial contributions
and the supplementary rules necessary for such participation.
This proposal, the draft Agreement with Liechtenstein, is to establish exactly those arrangements, to enable the Commission to assume
responsibility for the implementation of the budget of the instrument in this associated country and to determine Liechtensteins contribution to
the Union budget in respect of this instrument (around EUR 200 000 per year).
The rapporteur supported this proposal which will serve to accomplish a key objective of the Schengen acquis, namely to share responsibility
for an efficient, high and uniform level of control at the external borders, in compliance with the Unions commitment to fundamental freedoms
and human rights.

2016/0247(NLE) - 02/03/2017 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading

period 2014 to 2020.
In line with the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, Parliament gave its consent to the conclusion of the Protocol.

2016/0247(NLE) - 03/04/2017 Final act
PURPOSE: to approve the conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of an Agreement between the European Union and Liechtenstein on

CONTENT: the Council approved the Agreement between the EU and Liechtenstein on supplementary rules in relation to the instrument for
financial support for external borders and visa, as part of the Internal Security Fund for the period 2014 to 2020 on behalf of the Union
The Agreement was signed by the Commission on 5 December 2016, subject to its conclusion at a later date.
Through Regulation (EU) No 515/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council, the EU set up the instrument for financial support for
external borders and visa in the framework of the Internal Security Fund. That Regulation provides that the countries associated with the
development of the Schengen, amongst which is Liechtenstein, participate in the instrument and that arrangements are to be concluded on
their financial contributions and the supplementary rules necessary for such participation.
For the period 2016 to 2018, the Agreement provides that Liechtenstein will make payments of EUR 218 815 per year to the budget of the
ISF-Borders and Visa. For the years 2019 and 2020, Liechtensteins contributions will be calculated in accordance with its respective Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) as a percentage of the GDP of all States participating in the ISF-Borders and Visa.
This Decision constitutes a development of elements of the Schengen acquis in which the United Kingdom and Ireland do not take part.
