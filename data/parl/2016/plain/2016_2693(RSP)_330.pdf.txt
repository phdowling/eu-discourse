Summary

The European Parliament adopted by 539 votes to 27, with 43 abstentions, a resolution on The Gambia.
The resolution was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ECR, ALDE, GUE/NGL, Greens/EFA and EFDD groups.
Members recalled the peaceful protest, held on 14 April 2016 in Serekunda, a suburb of the capital Banjul, calling for electoral reform led to
violent reactions by the Gambian security forces and arbitrary detention of protestors, among them several members of the United Democratic
Party (UDP). Solo Sandeng, the opposition leader and a member of the UDP, died in detention shortly after his arrest in suspicious
circumstances.
Against this background, Parliament called for the immediate release of all protestors arrested in relation to the 14 and 16 April 2016 protests
and requested the Government of The Gambia to ensure due process for any suspects detained on allegations of participating in the
attempted unconstitutional change of government.
Members also called on the Gambian authorities to conduct a swift and independent investigation into these events, and in particular
expressed grave concern about the reported death in custody of opposition activist Solo Sandeng. They also strongly condemned the forced
disappearances, arbitrary detentions as well as attacks on LGBT people, under the government of President Yahya Jammeh.
Combat inhumain treatment: Parliament called on the EU and the African Union to work with The Gambia to put in place safeguards against
torture, ensure independent access to prisoners and reform all legislation interfering with the rights of freedom of expression, association and
peaceful assembly. It called on The Gambia to ratify the UN Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
Punishment.
It also called on Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the AU to remain engaged towards the ongoing human rights
violations committed by the Gambian regime. It recalled that security and stabilisation remain great challenges in the West African region.
Moreover, Parliament urged the Government of The Gambia to ratify the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance in advance
of the presidential elections scheduled for December 2016.
Towards democratic elections: Parliament called on The Gambia to engage in genuine dialogue with all opposition political parties on
legislative and policy reforms that will ensure a free and fair election in this country. The Gambia is urged to take all necessary measures to
guarantee, in all circumstances, full respect of freedom of expression and freedom of the press.
Cooperation agreement: Parliament is concerned that the 2015-2016 national indicative programme for The Gambia does not provide for any
support or funding for civil society or for democratic governance, promotion of the rule of law and human rights protection. It called on the
Commission to ensure that democratic governance, the rule of law and human rights protection are the focal sectors of any future
development cooperation agreements to be considered between the EU and The Gambia.
The EU Delegation to the Gambia is called upon to use all tools at its disposal, including the European Instrument for Democracy and Human
Rights, to actively monitor detention conditions in The Gambia, and to accompany and monitor investigations into the governments
suppression of the protests and the treatment of protestors in detention.
Lastly, Parliament urged the EU and its Member States to conduct a public consultation under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement, and to
consider freezing all non-humanitarian assistance to the Government of The Gambia.
