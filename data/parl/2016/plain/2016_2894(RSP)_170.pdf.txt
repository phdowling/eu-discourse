Summary

2016/2894(RSP) - 06/10/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 508 votes to 50, with 56 abstentions, a resolution on Syria.
The text adopted in plenary was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ECR, ALDE, Greens/ EFA and EFDD groups.
Members strongly condemned all attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure, as well as the recent attacks on a humanitarian relief
convoy and a Red Crescent warehouse near Aleppo as severe and alarming violations of international humanitarian law and as a possible war
crime.

Parliament called upon all parties in the conflict, and especially Russia and the Assad regime, to stop all attacks on civilians and civilian
infrastructure, including water and electrical infrastructure, to undertake credible and immediate steps for the cessation of hostilities, to lift all
sieges and to allow rapid, safe, and unhindered access for humanitarian agencies to reach all people in need.
All participants in the International Syria Support Group are urged to resume negotiations to facilitate the establishment of a stable truce and to
intensify work for a lasting political settlement in Syria.
The High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President is called upon to renew efforts towards a common EU Syria
Strategy, which would aim at facilitating a political settlement in Syria, and include monitoring and enforcement tools.
