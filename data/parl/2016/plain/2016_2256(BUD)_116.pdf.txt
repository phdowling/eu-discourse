2016/2256(BUD) - 30/09/2016 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: to mobilise the Contingency Margin in 2016 to address the unforeseen consequences of the migration crisis.
PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
CONTENT: Article 13 of the Council Regulation (EU, EURATOM) No 1311/2013 lays down the multiannual financial framework for the years
2014-2020 and allows for the mobilisation of the Contingency Margin of up to 0.03 % of Gross National Income.
After having examined all other financial possibilities to react to unforeseen circumstances within the 2016 expenditure ceilings for heading 3
Security and citizenship, and after having proposed to mobilise the Flexibility Instrument for headings 3 and 4 for the full amount of EUR 1 530
million available in 2016, the mobilisation of the Contingency Margin is necessary to address the needs stemming from the migration, refugee
and security crisis by increasing the commitment appropriations of heading 3 in the general budget of the European Union for the financial
year 2016, above the ceiling of this heading.
Justification of the mobilisation: a new instrument was adopted by the Council on 15 March 2016 to allow the provision of emergency support
of a humanitarian nature in response to the increased influx of refugees and migrants into the Union.
The funding needs for this new emergency instrument in 2016 were estimated at EUR 300 million in commitment appropriations and EUR 241
million in payment appropriations. EUR 199 million in commitment appropriations and EUR 130.2 million in payment appropriations have been
redeployed from AMIF, first in the context of the amending budget No 1/2016 (EUR 100 million in commitment appropriations and EUR 80.2
million in payment appropriations) and then, through a Commission transfer of appropriations implemented in August in accordance with
Article 26(1)(c) of the Financial Regulation (EUR 99 million in commitment appropriations and EUR 50 million in payment appropriations).
Likely outstanding needs related to the new emergency instrument, currently estimated at EUR 50 million in commitment appropriations and
EUR 10 million in payment appropriations, has still to be financed in 2016.
After taking account of the possible redeployments identified on other budget lines under heading 3 (EUR 9.9 million), the Commission has
requested to increase commitment appropriations by EUR 240.1 million above the ceiling of this heading in the draft amending budget No
4/2016.
The expenditure ceiling of heading 3 in 2016 stands at EUR 2 546 million in current prices.

The commitment appropriations authorised for heading 3 in the 2016 budget are EUR 4 052 million, which has already required the
mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument (EUR 1 506 million) over and above the ceiling of heading 3, in accordance with Article 11(2) of the
MFF Regulation.
Spending related to migration and, refugees and security: the Commission stated that this represents more than 70 % of total expenditure
under the ceiling of heading 3. The Commission has carefully examined all possibilities for redeployment and stated that it is only possible to
cover a small percentage of the needs in commitment appropriations as described above without jeopardising the proper functioning of the
other relatively smaller programmes.
As a consequence, the mobilisation of the Contingency Margin is the only possible recourse to meet the budgetary needs in commitment
appropriations. Availability of margins in other headings allows this mobilisation to be completely offset in 2016.
The needs in payment appropriations will be accommodated within the 2016 ceiling for payments, thus making the mobilisation of the
Contingency Margin in payments unnecessary.
Estimated needs: the Contingency Margin shall be mobilised to provide EUR 240.1 million in commitment appropriations over and above the
commitment ceiling of heading 3 of the multiannual financial framework.
This amount shall be fully offset against the margin of heading 5 Administration.

2016/2256(BUD) - 25/11/2016 Budgetary report tabled for plenary, 1st reading
The Committee on Budgets adopted the report by José Manuel FERNANDES (EPP, PT) on the proposal for a decision of the European
Parliament and of the Council on the mobilisation of the Contingency Margin in 2016.
As a reminder, Article 13 of Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 established a Contingency Margin of up to 0.03 % of the Gross
National Income of the Union. In accordance with that Regulation, the Commission calculated the absolute amount of the Contingency Margin
for 2016.
After having examined all other financial possibilities to react to unforeseen circumstances within the 2016 commitment ceiling for heading 3
(Security and citizenship) of the multiannual financial framework, and after having mobilised the Flexibility Instrument for the full amount of
EUR 1 530 million available in 2016, it appeared necessary to mobilise the Contingency Margin to address the needs stemming from the
migration, refugee and security crisis, by increasing the commitment appropriations in the general budget of the European Union for the
financial year 2016, above the commitment ceiling of heading 3.
As a result, the Commission proposed, together with Draft amending budget No 4/2016, to mobilise the Contingency Margin for 2016 for an
amount of EUR 240.1 million so as to complement the commitment appropriations related to expenditure in heading 3 Security and citizenship
in the general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2016.
Members called on the European Parliament to approve the decision annexed to this resolution.

2016/2256(BUD) - 01/12/2016 Budgetary text adopted by Parliament
The European Parliament adopted by 530 to 83, with 32 abstentions, a resolution on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament
and of the Council on the mobilisation of the Contingency Margin in 2016.
Parliament recalled that Article 13 of Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 established a Contingency Margin of up to 0.03 % of
the Gross National Income of the Union. In accordance with that Regulation, the Commission calculated the absolute amount of the
Contingency Margin for 2016.
After having examined all other financial possibilities to react to unforeseen circumstances within the 2016 commitment ceiling for heading 3
(Security and citizenship) of the multiannual financial framework, and after having mobilised the Flexibility Instrument for the full amount of
EUR 1 530 million available in 2016, it appeared necessary to mobilise the Contingency Margin to address the needs stemming from the
migration, refugee and security crisis, by increasing the commitment appropriations in the general budget of the European Union for the
financial year 2016, above the commitment ceiling of heading 3.
As a result, the Commission proposed, together with Draft amending budget No 4/2016, to mobilise the Contingency Margin for 2016 for an
amount of EUR 240.1 million so as to complement the commitment appropriations related to expenditure in heading 3 Security and citizenship
in the general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2016.
Parliament approved, unamended, the decision annexed to this resolution.

2016/2256(BUD) - 14/12/2016 Final act
PURPOSE: to mobilise the Contingency Margin in 2016 to address the unforeseen consequences of the migration crisis.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision (EU) 2017/339 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the mobilisation of the Contingency
Margin in 2016.
CONTENT: Article 13 of Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 has established a Contingency Margin of up to 0.03 % of the Gross
National Income of the Union.
In accordance with that Regulation, the Commission has calculated the absolute amount of the Contingency Margin for 2016.
After having examined all other financial possibilities to react to unforeseen circumstances within the 2016 commitment ceiling for heading 3

(Security and citizenship) of the multiannual financial framework, and after having mobilised the Flexibility Instrument for the full amount of
EUR 1 530 million available in 2016, it appears necessary to mobilise the Contingency Margin to address the needs stemming from the
migration, refugee and security crisis, by increasing the commitment appropriations in the general budget of the European Union for the
financial year 2016, above the commitment ceiling of heading 3.
The European Parliament and the Council therefore decided to mobilise the contingency margin under the 2016 budget in order to provide the
amount of EUR 240.1 million in commitment appropriations over and above the commitment ceiling of heading 3 of the multiannual financial
framework.
The amount of EUR 240.1 million in commitment appropriations shall be fully offset against the margin under the commitment ceiling of
heading 5 (Administration) of the multiannual financial framework for the financial year 2016.
Margin as the last resort: it is recalled that Article 13(1) of the MFF Regulation defines the contingency margin as a last resort instrument to
react to unforeseen circumstances.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: the Decision shall enter into force on 14.12.2016.
