2016/2043(BUD) - 07/04/2016 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: to mobilise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) to assist France in respect of redundancies in the road haulage
sector.
PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
CONTENT: Article 12 of Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 laying down the multiannual financial framework for the years
2014-2020 provides that the EGF shall not exceed a maximum annual amount of EUR 150 million (2011 prices) over and above the relevant
headings of the financial framework.
The rules applicable to financial contributions from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) are laid down in Regulation (EU) No
1309/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (2014-2020) and repealing
Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006.
In this context, the Commission examined the application for mobilisation of the EGF to assist France and concluded the following:
France: EGF/2015/010 FR/MoryGlobal: on 19 November 2015, France submitted application EGF/2015/010 FR/ MoryGlobal for a financial
contribution from the EGF, following redundancies in MoryGlobal SAS in France.
France submitted its application within 12 weeks of the date on which the intervention criteria were met. The deadline expired on 7 April 2016.
In order to establish the link between the redundancies and the global financial and economic crisis addressed in Regulation (EC) No
546/2009, France argues that MoryGlobal was active in the fields of courier services, freight transport and delivery, warehousing and rental of
related materials; and provided these services both within France and abroad.
As a result of the global financial and economic crisis, road haulage in vehicles weighing more than 3.5 tonnes declined by 13.7% in the EU
and by 21% in France between 2007 and 2012. This decline has been following the general decline of physical output in Europe and the road
transport sector in Europe has not yet recovered from the major activity decline it suffered in 2009 due to the economic crisis. In 2014, the
activity of road freight transport remained more than 10% lower compared with the pre-crisis activity.
Faced with the reduction in volumes to be transported, a price war broke out within the sector.
The current difficulties of MoryGlobal go back to 2012/2013. At the time the enterprise was known as Mory-Ducros. Mory-Ducros declared

itself insolvent on November 2013 and entered into liquidation procedures. The difficulties were not resolved after the take-over and the
company eventually went bankrupt and ceased all activity.
This is a follow-up application to a previous request, in support of the Mory-Ducros workers who moved to MoryGlobal.
Basis of the French application: France submitted the application under the intervention criteria of Article 4(1)(a) of the EGF Regulation, which
requires at least 500 workers being made redundant over a reference period of four months in an enterprise in a Member State, including
workers made redundant by suppliers and downstream producers and / or self-employed persons whose activity has ceased.
The reference period of four months for the application runs from 27 April 2015 to 27 August 2015. During the reference period 2 093 workers
were made redundant in MoryGlobal. The total number of eligible beneficiaries is 2 132.
Having examined this application, the proposed contribution from the EGF to the coordinated package of personalised services is EUR 5 146
800.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: having examined the application in respect of the conditions set out in Article 13(1) of the EGF Regulation, and
having taken into account the number of targeted beneficiaries, the proposed actions and the estimated costs, the Commission proposes to
mobilise the EGF for the amount of EUR 5 146 800, representing 60 % of the total costs of the proposed actions, in order to provide a financial
contribution for the application.
The proposed decision to mobilise the EGF will be taken jointly by the European Parliament and the Council, as laid down in point 13 of the
Interinstitutional Agreement of 2 December 2013 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline,
on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management.
At the same time as it presents this proposal for a decision to mobilise the EGF, the Commission will present to the European Parliament and
to the Council a proposal for a transfer to the relevant budgetary line for the amount of EUR 5 146 800.
At the same time as it adopts this proposal for a decision to mobilise the EGF, the Commission will adopt a decision on a financial contribution,
by means of an implementing act, which will enter into force on the date at which the European Parliament and the Council adopt the
proposed decision to mobilise the EGF.

2016/2043(BUD) - 24/05/2016 Budgetary report tabled for plenary, 1st reading
The Committee on Budgets adopted the report by Anneli JÄÄTTEENMÄKI (ADLE, FI) on the proposal for a decision of the European
Parliament and of the Council on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for an amount of EUR 5 146 800 in
commitment and payment appropriations to assist France in respect of redundancies in the road haulage sector.
Members recalled that the Union has set up legislative and budgetary instruments to provide additional support to workers who are suffering
from the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns or of the global financial and economic crisis and to assist their
reintegration into the labour market.
French application: France submitted application EGF/2015/010 FR/MoryGlobal for a financial contribution from the EGF, following
redundancies in the economic sector classified under the NACE Rev.2 Division 49 (Land transport and transport via pipelines) and Division 52
(Warehousing and support activities for transportation) throughout mainland France, and whereas 2 132 redundant workers eligible for an EGF
contribution are expected to participate in the measures. The request follows the judicial liquidation of MoryGlobal and is a follow-up to the
application EGF/2014/017 FR/MoryDucros.
The application was submitted under the intervention criteria of point (a) of Article 4(1) of the EGF Regulation, which requires at least 500
workers being made redundant over a reference period of four months in an enterprise in a Member State, including workers made redundant
by suppliers and downstream producers and/or selfemployed persons whose activity has ceased.
Nature of the redundancies: Members considered that the redundancies in MoryGlobal are linked to the general decline in physical output in
Europe, which has led to a reduction in volumes to be transported and a price war in the road haulage sector, resulting in a steady
deterioration in operating margins and a series of losses for the sector in France since 2007, followed by a wave of bankruptcies, including that
of Mory-Ducros and later of MoryGlobal, which re-employed 2 107 of Mory-Ducros' former workers.
A package of personalised services: Members welcomed the fact that the French authorities started providing the personalised services to the
affected workers on 23 April 2015, ahead of the application on the granting of EGF support for the proposed coordinated package. They noted
that the EGF cofunded personalised services to be provided consist of advice and guidance provided by a team of expert consultants, which
are additional to the social plan and the Contrat de Sécurisation Professionnelle funded by the French State to help the workers back into
employment.
They considered that workers in the 55-64 age group are at a higher risk of long-term unemployment and exclusion from the labour market
with the possible effect of social exclusion. They considered therefore that those workers, who make up over 19% of the beneficiaries
expected to be targeted by the proposed actions, have specific needs when it comes to providing them with personalised approach in
accordance with Article 7 of the EGF Regulation.
Members noted that the French authorities confirmed that the proposed actions do not receive financial support from other Union funds or
financial instruments and that they are complementary to actions funded by the Structural Funds.
They reiterated that assistance from the EGF comes in addition to national measures and must not replace actions which are the responsibility
of Member States or of companies.
Lastly, Members recalled their appeal to the Commission to assure public access to all the documents related to EGF cases.

2016/2043(BUD) - 26/05/2016 Budgetary text adopted by Parliament

The European Parliament adopted by 540 votes to 73, with 2 abstentions, a resolution on the proposal for a decision of the European
Parliament and of the Council on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for an amount of EUR 5 146 800 in
commitment and payment appropriations to assist France in respect of redundancies in the road haulage sector.
Parliament recalled that the Union has set up legislative and budgetary instruments to provide additional support to workers who are suffering
from the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns or of the global financial and economic crisis and to assist their
reintegration into the labour market.
French application: France submitted application EGF/2015/010 FR/MoryGlobal for a financial contribution from the EGF, following
redundancies in the economic sector classified under the NACE Rev.2 Division 49 (Land transport and transport via pipelines) and Division 52

application EGF/2014/017 FR/MoryDucros.
The application was submitted under the intervention criteria of point (a) of Article 4(1) of the EGF Regulation, which requires at least 500
workers being made redundant over a reference period of four months in an enterprise in a Member State, including workers made redundant
by suppliers and downstream producers and/or selfemployed persons whose activity has ceased.
Nature of the redundancies: Parliament considered that the redundancies in MoryGlobal are linked to the general decline in physical output in
Europe, which has led to a reduction in volumes to be transported and a price war in the road haulage sector, resulting in a steady
deterioration in operating margins and a series of losses for the sector in France since 2007, followed by a wave of bankruptcies, including that
of Mory-Ducros and later of MoryGlobal, which re-employed 2 107 of Mory-Ducros' former workers.
Older workers: Parliament recalled that the EGF support for 2 513 former Mory-Ducros workers, approved in April 2015, amounts to EUR 6
052 200. It considered that workers in the 55-64 age group are at a higher risk of long-term unemployment and exclusion from the labour
market with the possible effect of social exclusion. Members considered therefore that those workers, who make up over 19% of the
beneficiaries expected to be targeted by the proposed actions, have specific needs when it comes to providing them with personalised
approach in accordance with Article 7 of the EGF Regulation.
A package of personalised services: Parliament welcomed the fact that the French authorities started providing the personalised services to
the affected workers on 23 April 2015, ahead of the application on the granting of EGF support for the proposed coordinated package. It noted
that the EGF cofunded personalised services to be provided consist of advice and guidance provided by a team of expert consultants, which
are additional to the social plan and the Contrat de Sécurisation Professionnelle funded by the French State to help the workers back into
employment.
External consultants for the implementation of measures: Parliament noted that the EGF cofunded personalised services to be provided
consist of advice and guidance provided by a team of expert consultants, which are additional to the social plan and the Contrat de
Sécurisation Professionnelle funded by the French State to help the workers back into employment. It noted that the three contractors
operating the team of consultants are the ones providing services to the workers made redundant by Mory-Ducros. It expects the Commission
and the French authorities to strictly follow the principle according to which payments to the agencies are to be made on the basis of results
achieved.
Parliament noted that the contractors (BPI, Sodie and AFPA Transitions) shall assist the redundant workers and help them find solutions to
remain in the labour market and find new jobs, through personalised services such as collective and individual information sessions, job
transition and accompaniment towards new jobs. The contractors operating the team of consultants are the same as those providing services
to the workers made redundant by Mory-Ducros. Parliament called on the Commission to provide an evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of the
ongoing support for the redundant workers of Mory-Ducros, as the current application is a follow-up to the EGF/2014/017 FR/Mory-Ducros
application, and the personalised services are provided by the same contractors.
Parliament noted that the French authorities confirmed that the proposed actions do not receive financial support from other Union funds or
financial instruments and that they are complementary to actions funded by the Structural Funds. It reiterated that assistance from the EGF
comes in addition to national measures and must not replace actions which are the responsibility of Member States or of companies.
Lastly, Parliament recalled its appeal to the Commission to assure public access to all the documents related to EGF cases.

2016/2043(BUD) - 08/06/2016 Final act
PURPOSE: to mobilise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) to assist France in respect of redundancies in the road haulage
sector.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision (EU) 2016/989 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the mobilisation of the European
Globalisation Adjustment Fund (application from France EGF/2015/010 FR/MoryGlobal).
CONTENT: with this Decision, the European Parliament and the Council decided to mobilise EUR 5 146 800 in commitments and payments
under the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund in the framework of the 2016 budget.
This amount shall assist France in respect of redundancies in the road haulage sector.
On 19 November 2015, France submitted an application EGF/2015/010 FR/MoryGlobal for a financial contribution from the EGF, following
redundancies in MoryGlobal SAS in France.
Given that the application complies with the requirements for determining a financial contribution from the EGF as laid down in Article 13 of
Regulation (EU) No 1309/2013 (EGF Regulation 2014-2020), the European Parliament and the Council decided to mobilise the amount
requested.
To recall, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) aims to provide support for workers made redundant and self-employed persons
whose activity has ceased as a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation, as a result of a continuation of
the global financial and economic crisis, or as a result of a new global financial and economic crisis, and to assist them with their reintegration
into the labour market.

The EGF is not to exceed a maximum annual amount of EUR 150 million, as laid down in Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013.
Therefore, it has been decided to mobilise the EGF in order to provide the requested financial contribution in respect of the application
submitted by France.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 21.06.2016. This Decision shall apply retroactively from 8 June 2016.
