Summary

2016/2993(RSP) - 24/11/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 479 votes to 37, with 107 abstentions, a resolution on EU-Turkey relations.
The text adopted in plenary was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ECR, ALDE, GUE/NGL and Greens/EFA groups.
Parliament strongly condemned the disproportionate repressive measures taken in Turkey since the failed military coup attempt in July 2016.
The Turkish Governments repressive measures under the state of emergency are disproportionate and in breach of basic rights and freedoms
protected by the Turkish Constitution, of democratic values upon which the European Union is founded.
While reaffirming its commitment to keeping Turkey anchored to the EU, Parliament called on the Commission and the Member States to
initiate a temporary freeze of the ongoing accession negotiations with Turkey. It is committed to reviewing its position when the
disproportionate measures under the state of emergency in Turkey are lifted.
Members reiterated that the reintroduction of capital punishment by the Turkish Government would have to lead to a formal suspension of the
accession process, recalling that the unequivocal rejection of the death penalty is an essential element of the Union acquis.
Parliament noted that to date Turkey has not fulfilled 7 out of 72 benchmarks of the visa liberalisation roadmap . It expressed its concern at
statements disputing the Treaty of Lausanne, which defines the borders of modern Turkey and has contributed to safeguarding peace and
stability in the region for almost a century.
Recognising that, while Turkey is an important partner of the EU, Members considered that the political will to cooperate has to come from
both sides of a partnership. However, it believes that Turkey is not demonstrating this political will, as the governments actions are further
diverting Turkey from its European path.
In this regard, Parliament recalled that paragraph 5 of the Negotiating Framework stipulates that, in the case of a serious and persistent
breach in Turkey of the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law on which the
Union is founded, the Commission will, on its own initiative or on the request of one third of the Member States, recommend the suspension of
negotiations and propose the conditions for eventual resumption.
