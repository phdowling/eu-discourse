Briefing

2016/0005(NLE) - 22/01/2016 Initial legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude the Economic Partnership Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and the
SADC EPA States, of the other part.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: on 12 June 2002, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations for Economic Partnership Agreements with

the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States.
The negotiations have been concluded and the Economic Partnership Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the
one part, and the SADC EPA States (comprising Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland (BLMNS) and South Africa).
The negotiations were completed at the level of the Chief Negotiators on 15 July 2014 in Pretoria. The Agreement was initialled on 15 July
2014 in Pretoria.
It should be noted that:
Botswana, Namibia and Swaziland currently benefit from preferential market access to the EU under the arrangements laid down in
the Market Access Regulation (MAR) ;
Lesotho and Mozambique currently benefit from the arrangements under the 'Everything But Arms' initiative, since they are classified
among the Least Developed Countries (LDCs);
trade between the EU and South Africa is currently governed by the Trade, Development and Cooperation Agreement (TDCA).
The SADC EPA will provide a uniform access regime for the BLMNS countries. For South Africa, the SADC EPA will replace the relevant
provisions of Titles II and III of the TDCA, dealing respectively with trade and trade related issues.
It is now necessary to conclude this Agreement on behalf of the European Union.
CONTENT: with this proposal, the Council is called upon to adopt a Decision to approve, on behalf of the European Union and its Member
States, the Economic Partnership Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and the SADC EPA
States, of the other part.
Scope and purpose of the Agreement: the Agreement contains provisions on:
cooperation,
trade in goods,
trade and sustainable development,
customs and trade facilitation,
technical barriers to trade,
sanitary and phytosanitary measures,
dispute settlement,
geographical indications,
rules of origin.
The Agreement also contains rendez-vous clauses on trade in services and investment, competition policy, intellectual property rights, and
public procurement.
Trade provisions: the SADC EPA is a development-oriented trade agreement. It offers asymmetric market access to the SADC EPA States,
which allows them to shield sensitive sectors from liberalisation; it provides a large number of safeguards and a clause for infant industry
protection; it contains provisions on the rules of origin that facilitate exports; and it eliminates the use of export subsidies in trade between the
Parties.
The EPA guarantees duty-free, quota-free access to the EU market for Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, and Swaziland, with the
exception of arms and ammunition.
South Africa will benefit from new market access additional to the TDCA, that currently governs its trade relations with the EU. The EU will
obtain meaningful new market access into the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) and will have the security of a bilateral agreement
with Mozambique, one of the LDCs in the region.
The EPA is designed to be compatible with the operation of SACU, in particular by fully harmonising SACU's import trade regime. SACU
presents a single external schedule of tariffs and quota arrangements applied to imports from the EU.
The SADC EPA also contains a chapter on Trade and Sustainable Development that links the trade agreement to EU objectives in the field of
labour, environment, and climate change.
Institutional provisions and monitoring: the Parties undertake to continuously monitor the operation and impact of this Agreement.
The institutional provisions establish a Joint Council at Ministerial level to be responsible for the operation and implementation of the
Agreement and to monitor the fulfilment of its objectives. The Joint Council shall be assisted by a Trade and Development Committee.
Furthermore, the Agreement:
establishes a Special Committee on Geographical Indications and Trade in Wines and Spirits with the purpose of monitoring the
development of the Protocol on GIs and trade in wines and spirits;
establishes a Special Committee on Customs and Trade Facilitation that will monitor the implementation and operation of the chapter
on Customs and Trade Facilitation and the Protocol on rules of origin;
contains a provision that allows each Party to request consultations regarding any matter under the Trade and Sustainable
Development chapter. Dialogue and cooperation may include other relevant authorities and stakeholders.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal is without budgetary implications on Union expenditure but will have a budgetary impact on the
revenue side. Thus, foregone duty is estimated to amount to EUR 33.3 million upon full implementation of the Agreement after ten years. This
estimate is based on the average volume of imports over the period 2012-2014. With the exception of a number of products imported from
South Africa, imports from the SADC EPA Group already enter the European Union duty free.

2016/0005(NLE) - 19/07/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on International Trade adopted the report by Alexander Graf LAMBSDORFF (ADLE, DE) on the draft Council decision on the
conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Economic Partnership Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of
the one part, and the SADC EPA States, of the other part.
The committee recommended the European Parliament to give its consent to the conclusion of the Agreement.
The committee recalled that the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs), which are trade and development partnerships between the
African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) States and the European Union, are aimed at supporting trade, regional integration and the gradual
integration of ACP countries into the world economy, along with fostering their sustainable development.
While insisting on the overall favourable effects of the SADC EPA, Members stated that it is important to strengthen the monitoring provisions
in the agreement. They called for the establishment of a sustainable-development dialogue and relevant participative processes for monitoring.
Members stressed their regret at the absence of a Joint Parliamentary Committee and a Joint Consultative Committee to improve this type of
dialogue.
Overall, Members recommended giving consent to the SADC - EU Economic Partnership Agreement given that it has the potential to bring
fundamental positive change and contribute to sustainable economic growth and deepened intra-regional trade and integration.
However, the trade and partnership agreement can only be a small part of a larger strategy. The SADC states should conduct trade and
development-friendly domestic policies and pursue structural reforms. The regulatory framework that attracts investment is another element in
the equation. These countries should also consider using the potential of the EPA by going beyond trade in goods only and also address
services in the future.
According to Members, the EU should provide assistance in terms of capacity building and trade related assistance.

2016/0005(NLE) - 14/09/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 417 votes to 216, with 66 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the draft Council decision on the
conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Economic Partnership Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of
the one part, and the SADC EPA States, of the other part.
Parliament gave its consent to the conclusion of the Agreement given that it has the potential to bring fundamental positive change and
contribute to sustainable economic growth and deepened intra-regional trade and integration between the SADC EPA States (Botswana,
Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa and Swaziland).
