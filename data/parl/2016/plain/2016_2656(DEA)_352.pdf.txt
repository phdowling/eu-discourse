Summary

2016/2656(DEA) - 10/05/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament decided to raise no objections to the Commission Delegated Regulation of 8 April 2016 correcting Delegated
Regulation (EU) 2016/341 supplementing Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards transitional
rules for certain provisions of the Union Customs Code where the relevant electronic systems are not yet operational and amending Delegated
Regulation (EU) 2015/2446.
Following the adoption of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/341, it was detected that some forms, in the part concerning simplifications, were
erroneously omitted from Annex 12, which will have a very negative impact for customs authorities and traders if they are not added before 1
May 2016, when the relevant provisions of the Union Customs Code and its implementing provisions will become applicable.
Regarding that same Annex 12, in the part concerning simplifications, certain errors were also detected concerning the terminology used in the
forms.
Therefore, Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/341 should therefore be corrected accordingly to include in Annex 12 , in the part concerning
simplifications, the forms that are missing and, in the same part of that Annex, to replace the existing forms. In order to ensure that the
Customs Union functions smoothly and that there is no disruption of trade flows, the delegated regulation needs to be applied as from 1 May
2016.
Parliament recalled that the scrutiny period has been set as two months from the date of notification, that is to say, it runs until 9 June 2016.
However, on grounds of urgency, the Commission asked on 11 March 2016 for an early confirmation of the delegated regulation before 1 May
2016 by Parliament.
