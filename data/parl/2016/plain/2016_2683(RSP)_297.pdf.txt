Summary

2016/2683(RSP) - 08/06/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 430 votes to 188, with 33 abstentions, a resolution on the draft Commission implementing decision as
regards the placing on the market of a genetically modified carnation (Dianthus caryophyllus L., line SHD-27531-4).
Parliament considered that the draft Commission implementing decision does not fulfil the objective of health and environment protection
provided for in Directive 2001/18/EC and therefore exceeds the implementing powers provided for in this Directive.
It called on the Commission to withdraw its draft implementing decision.
To recall, in March 2013, a notification (reference C/NL/13/01) concerning the placing on the market of a genetically modified carnation
(Dianthus caryophyllus L. , line SHD-27531-4), sulfonylurea-resistant plants, was submitted by Suntory Holdings Limited, Osaka, Japan, to the
competent authority of the Netherlands.
Members stressed that sulfonylureas are common second-line options for management of type 2 diabetes and are associated with a higher
risk of cardiovascular events compared with other antidiabetic drugs. They are highly toxic to plants at very low doses. Creating a market for
sulfonylurea-resistant plants will encourage the worldwide use of this medicine against diabetes as a herbicide. Using a medicine for a
purpose other than public health which leads to its uncontrolled spread in the ecosystems can have worldwide detrimental effects on
biodiversity and cause chemical contamination of drinking water.
Experts have warned that the wide-spread use of sulfonylureas could have a devastating impact on the productivity of non-target crops and
the make-up of natural plant communities and wildlife food chains.
Moreover, Members stated that the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) opinion states that the EFSA GMO Panel is aware of a food habit
in certain populations to intentionally consume carnation petals as garnish. The GMO Panel did not, however, assess the possible
consequences of the intentional consumption of GM carnations by humans. Both intentional and accidental oral intake of GM carnation flowers
by animals were excluded from the EFSA opinion.
