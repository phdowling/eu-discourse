Summary

2016/2083(IMM) - 15/07/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Legal Affairs unanimously adopted the report by Gilles LEBRETON (ECR, FR) in which it called on the European
Parliament to waive the immunity of Sotirios ZARIANOPOULOS (NI, EL).
The public prosecutor at the Greek Supreme Court requested the waiver of the immunity of Sotirios Zarianopoulos MEP in connection with his
activities as a city councillor.

The proposed proceedings concern the issuing in 2011 by Thessaloniki City Council of allegedly illegal permits to use public property for the
purpose of setting up outside seating areas on pavements. Sotirios Zarianopoulos is to be prosecuted in his capacity as a former member of
that city council.
The Greek authorities are proposing to prosecute Sotirios Zarianopoulos for failing to comply with legal obligations jointly with others.
The proposed proceedings are clearly unrelated to Sotirios Zarianopouloss status as a Member of the European Parliament, but are related to
his former mandate as a member of Thessaloniki City Council.
The proposed proceedings do not concern opinions expressed or votes cast in the performance of the duties of the Member of the European
Parliament in question within the meaning of Article 8 of Protocol No 7 on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Union. Therefore, the
committee recommended the European to waive the immunity of Sotirios Zarianopoulos.

2016/2083(IMM) - 13/09/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament decided to waive the immunity of Sotirios ZARIANOPOULOS (NI, EL).
Parliament recalled that he is pursued in Greece for having allegedly granted illegal permits to use public property for the purpose of setting up
outside seating areas on pavements.
Given that the proposed proceedings are clearly unrelated to Sotirios Zarianopouloss status as a Member of the European Parliament, but are
related to his former mandate as a member of Thessaloniki City Council and that they do not concern opinions expressed or votes cast in the
performance of the duties of the Member of the European Parliament, Parliament decided to waive the immunity of Sotirios Zarianopoulos.
