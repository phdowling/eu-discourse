Summary

2016/2708(RPS) - 07/07/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a resolution on the draft Commission regulation amending Regulation (EU) No 432/2012 establishing a list
of permitted health claims made on foods other than those referring to the reduction of disease risk and to childrens development and health.
The resolution was tabled by the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
Parliament is opposed to the adoption of the draft Commission regulation considering that the draft Commission regulation is not compatible
with the aim and content of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 on nutrition and health claims made on foods.
Members considered that there are legitimate concerns that the claims that caffeine helps to increase alertness and that caffeine helps to
improve concentration do not demonstrate a relationship between caffeine consumption and health.
Members stated that under the draft Commission regulation, the claims that caffeine helps to increase alertness and that caffeine helps to
improve concentration shall not be used for foods targeting children and adolescents who represent the largest group of energy drink
consumers (68 % of adolescents and 18 % of children regularly consume energy drinks).
A 250 ml can of energy drink can contain up to 27 g of sugar and 80 mg of caffeine. Given that 25 % of adolescent energy drink consumers
drink three or more cans in a single session, the proposed claims might encourage the consumption of even greater quantities of such energy
drinks.
Moreover, the proposed warning label (conditions of use) does not provide any warning regarding the maximum consumption per single
intake, but refers only to the maximum intake per day.
The daily intake of sugar and caffeine might legitimately be expected to exceed the recommended maximum daily intake.
Members recalled that the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) found evidence that a high intake of sugars in the form of sugar-sweetened
beverages might contribute to weight gain.
Moreover, energy drinks have been linked to headaches, sleep problems and behavioural problems in children and adolescents who regularly
consume them.
Given the abovementioned reasons, Parliament called on the Commission to withdraw the draft regulation and for Member States to consider
introducing rules on the marketing of beverages with high caffeine content or foods with added caffeine to children and adolescents.
