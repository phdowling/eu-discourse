2016/2214(BUD) - 05/09/2016 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: to mobilise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) to assist Sweden in respect of redundancies in
telecommunications sector.
PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
CONTENT: Article 12 of Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 laying down the multiannual financial framework for the years
2014-2020 provides that the EGF is not to exceed a maximum annual amount of EUR 150 million (2011 prices).
The rules applicable to financial contributions from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) are laid down in Regulation (EU) No
1309/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (2014-2020) and repealing
Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006.
Against this backdrop, the Commission examined the application to mobilise the EGF to assist Sweden and expressed its position as follows:
Sweden: EGF/2016/002 SE/Ericsson: on 31 March 2016, Sweden submitted an application EGF/2016/002 SE/Ericsson for a financial
contribution from the EGF, following redundancies in Ericsson in Sweden.
Sweden submitted application EGF/2016/002 SE/Ericsson within 12 weeks of the date on which the intervention criteria set out the EGF
Regulation. This deadline expires on 5 September 2016.
In order to establish the link between the redundancies and major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation, Sweden
argues that the redundancies occurred in the telecom hardware production business line of Ericsson.
In the past years, Ericsson has concentrated most of its hardware production and development facilities in Asia, where not only the strongest
growth markets are located, but also equivalent quality can be delivered at lower costs.
According to data published by Ericsson, the company has gradually been cutting staff in Sweden (from 21 178 in 2005 to 17 858 in 2014), but
in the meantime been growing tremendously worldwide (from 56 055 in 2005 to 118 055 in 2014), India currently being the country with the
largest number of employees.
The events giving rise to these redundancies are the partial or entire closure of wireless telecom hardware production lines at various Ericsson
sites (Borås, Karlskrona, Kista/Stockholm, Kumla, Linköping and Gothenburg) in Sweden, and the closure of an entire plant in the city of
Katrineholm.
Facing stagnating growth and simultaneously facing harder competition with Asian producers, Ericsson has been scaling down telecom
hardware production, a process that started almost two decades ago. The company sold its entire mobile phone development and production
line to competitor Sony in February 2012. Ericsson is concentrating its remaining hardware production lines at production sites in Asia.
To date, the NACE 2 Division 26 sector has been the subject of another 14 EGF applications, 11 of which based on trade related globalisation
and 3 on the global financial and economic crisis.
The application relates to 1 556 workers made redundant in Ericsson (Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson). Ericsson operates primarily in the
economic sectors classified under the NACE Revision 2 Division 26 (Manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products) and 62
(Computer programming, consultancy and related activities). The redundancies made by Ericsson are mainly located in the NUTS level 2
regions of Stockholm (SE11) and Östra Mellansverige (SE12), but also in Sydsverige (SE22) and Västsverige (SE23).

Basis of the Swedish application: Sweden submitted the application under the intervention criteria of Article 4(1)(a) of the EGF Regulation,
which requires at least 500 workers being made redundant over a reference period of four months in an enterprise in a Member State. The
reference period of four months for the application runs from 11 September 2015 to 11 January 2016.
The redundancies concern 1 244 workers made redundant in Ericsson. In addition to the workers already referred to, the eligible beneficiaries
include 312 workers made redundant before or after the reference period of four months. These workers were all made redundant after the
general announcement of the projected redundancies on 11 September 2015.
The Swedish authorities declared that these redundancies were all part of the same redundancy procedure, but some redundancies were only
announced after the end of the reference period. The total number of eligible beneficiaries is therefore 1 556.
The Commission proposes to mobilise the EGF for the amount of EUR 3 957 918.
FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: having examined the application in respect of the conditions set out in Article 13(1) of the EGF Regulation, and
having taken into account the number of targeted beneficiaries, the proposed actions and the estimated costs, the Commission proposes to
mobilise the EGF for the amount of EUR 3 957 918, representing 60 % of the total costs of the proposed actions, in order to provide a financial
contribution for the application.
The proposed decision to mobilise the EGF will be taken jointly by the European Parliament and the Council, as laid down in point 13 of the
Interinstitutional Agreement of 2 December 2013 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline,
on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management.
At the same time as it presents this proposal for a decision to mobilise the EGF, the Commission will present to the European Parliament and
to the Council a proposal for a transfer to the relevant budgetary line for the requested amount.
At the same time as it adopts this proposal for a decision to mobilise the EGF, the Commission will adopt a decision on a financial contribution,
by means of an implementing act, which will enter into force on the date at which the European Parliament and the Council adopt the
proposed decision to mobilise the EGF.

2016/2214(BUD) - 29/09/2016 Budgetary report tabled for plenary, 1st reading
The Committee on Budgets adopted the report by Esteban GONZÁLEZ PONS (EPP, ES) on the proposal for a decision of the European
Parliament and of the Council on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for an amount of EUR 3 957 918 in
commitment and payment appropriations to assist Sweden affected by redundancies in the telecommunications sector.
Members recalled that the Union has set up legislative and budgetary instruments to provide additional support to workers who are suffering
from the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns or of the global financial and economic crisis and to assist their
reintegration into the labour market.
Swedish application: Sweden submitted application EGF/2016/002 SE/Ericsson for a financial contribution from the EGF, following
redundancies in the economic sector classified under the NACE Revision 2 Division 26 (Manufacture of computer, electronic and optical
products) mainly in the NUTS level 2 regions of Stockholm, Östra Mellansverige, Sydsverige and Västsverige. 918 out of 1556 redundant
workers eligible for the EGF contribution are expected to participate in in the measures.
The application was submitted under the intervention criteria of point (a) of Article 4(1) of the EGF Regulation, which requires at least 500
workers being made redundant over a reference period of four months in an enterprise in a Member State, including workers made redundant
by suppliers and downstream producers and / or selfemployed persons whose activity has ceased.
Therefore, Sweden is eligible for a financial contribution.
Nature of the redundancies: Members revealed that the IT and telecommunication industries are dominated by Asian manufacturers which
have become an outsourcing destination. Ericsson has gradually been cutting staff in Sweden (from 21 178 in 2005 to 17 858 in 2014), but in
the meantime been growing tremendously worldwide (from 56 055 in 2005 to 118 055 in 2014).
Members emphasised that the regions affected are faced with a relatively large group of older workers with similar backgrounds who have
been made redundant at the same time and that most of them, particularly those located in Kista, the town with the highest number of
redundancies, do not possess the skills sought by the local labour market.
A package of personalised services: Members recognised that most of the affected white-collar workers are engineers, some of whom are
specialised in niches that are unique to Ericsson. They noted that the EGF co-funded personalised services for the redundant workers include:
counselling and career guidance;
sheltered and supported employment and rehabilitation measures;
education and training;
job search allowances.
They welcomed the special emphasis that will be placed on participants aged 50 and above when providing motivational coaching and career
planning.
Members noted that the income support measures amount to 33.92 % of the overall package of personalised measures, close to the
maximum 35 % set out in the EGF Regulation.
These actions are conditional on the active participation of the targeted beneficiaries in job-search or training activities . Members called on the
Commission to further set out, in future proposals, the sectors in which the workers are likely to find employment and if the training on offer is
aligned to the future economic prospects and labour market needs in the regions concerned by the dismissals.
They noted that the Swedish authorities have confirmed that the proposed actions will not receive financial support from other Union funds or
financial instruments, that any double financing will be prevented and that those actions are complementary to actions funded by the Structural
Funds.

They also recalled the importance of improving the employability of all workers by means of adapted training and the recognition of skills and
competences gained throughout a worker's professional career.
Lastly, Members reiterated that assistance from the EGF must not replace actions which are the responsibility of companies by virtue of
national law or collective agreements nor of measures for restructuring companies or sectors.

2016/2214(BUD) - 04/10/2016 Budgetary text adopted by Parliament
The European Parliament adopted by 594 votes to 71, with 10 abstentions, a resolution on the proposal for a decision of the European
Parliament and of the Council on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for an amount of EUR 3 957 918 in
commitment and payment appropriations to assist Sweden affected by redundancies in the telecommunications sector.
Parliament recalled that the Union has set up legislative and budgetary instruments to provide additional support to workers who are suffering

A package of personalised services: Parliament recalled the diversity of employees, both blue- and white-collar, affected by the redundancies.
It is concerned that some workers face a labour market with rather low demand in traditional manufacturing industries. It recognised that most
of the affected white-collar workers are engineers, some of whom are specialised in niches that are unique to Ericsson.

2016/2214(BUD) - 11/10/2016 Final act
PURPOSE: to mobilise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) for EUR 3 957 918 to assist Sweden in respect of redundancies in
telecommunications sector.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision (EU) 2016/1858 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the mobilisation of the European
Globalisation Adjustment Fund (following an application from Sweden EGF/2016/002 SE/Ericsson).
CONTENT: under this Decision, the European Parliament and the Council decided to mobilise EUR 5 364 000 in commitment and payment
appropriations under the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund in the framework of the 2016 budget.

This amount shall assist Sweden financially in respect of redundancies in Ericsson (Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson).
Given that the application complies with the requirements for determining a financial contribution from the EGF as laid down in Regulation (EU)
No 1309/2013, the European Parliament and the Council have responded by granting the above-mentioned amount.
In brief, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) aims to provide support for workers made redundant and self-employed persons
whose activity has ceased as a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation, as a result of a continuation of
the global financial and economic crisis, or as a result of a new global financial and economic crisis, and to assist them with their reintegration
into the labour market.
Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 laying down the multiannual financial framework for the years 2014-2020 provides that the
EGF is not to exceed a maximum annual amount of EUR 150 million.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: the Decision shall enter into force on 20.10.2016 and shall apply from 11.10.2016.
