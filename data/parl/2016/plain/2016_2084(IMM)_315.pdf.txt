Summary

2016/2084(IMM) - 30/09/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Legal Affairs unanimously adopted the report by MARINHO E PINTO (ADLE, PT) and recommended that the European
Parliament waive the immunity of Giorgos GRAMMATIKAKIS (S&D, EL).

Members recalled that the deputy public prosecutor at the Supreme Court of the Hellenic Republic has requested the waiver of the immunity of
Giorgos Grammatikakis, in connection with proceedings relating to an alleged offence in Crete, during the period 2000-2002.
The proposed proceedings concern a discussion held on 8 March 1996 on the possibility of concluding a new private collective insurance
policy ? in addition to the compulsory insurance policy ? for all employees of the University of Crete and allegedly unlawful payments being
made in successive instalments over the period 2000-2002.
Members noted that a previous proceeding on the same case covered the period from 2000 onwards and resulted in the acquittal of all the
accused.
Noting further that the proposed proceedings are clearly unrelated to Giorgos Grammatikakis?s status as a Member of the European
Parliament, given that they relate to his former position as Rector of the Senate of the University of Crete, and that they do not concern
opinions expressed or votes cast in the performance of the duties of the Member of the European Parliament, Members recommended that
Parliament waive the immunity of Giorgos Grammatikakis.
Members also indicated that they were surprised that the waiver of immunity is being requested some 20 years after the events have occurred,
and that the Greek justice system was not able to bring proceedings against Giorgos Grammatikakis during this period. They considered that a
justice system that moves slowly will never be truly just because the people involved are no longer the same as they were 20 years ago.
