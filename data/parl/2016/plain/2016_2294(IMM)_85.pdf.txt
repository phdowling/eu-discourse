Summary

2016/2294(IMM) - 18/04/2017 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Legal Affairs unanimously adopted the report by Gilles LEBRETON (ENF, FR) in which it recommended the European
Parliament to waive the immunity of António Marinho e Pinto (ALDE, PT).
Members recalled that the judge of the Lisbon West (Oeiras) District Court requested the waiver of the parliamentary immunity of António
Marinho e Pinto, Member of the European Parliament, in connection with judicial proceedings concerning an alleged criminal offence of

aggravated defamation, punishable by up to two years imprisonment, and an offence of undermining the reputation of an organisation, service
or collective body.
The complaint was lodged by a charitable association, Santa Casa de Misericórdia de Lisboa.
Given that the alleged acts have no obvious or direct connection with the performance of António Marinho e Pintos duties as a Member of the
European Parliament and that they relate rather to activities of a purely national nature, and do not concern opinions expressed or votes cast
in the performance of his duties as a Member of the European Parliament for the purposes of Article 8 of Protocol No 7 on the Privileges and
Immunities of the European Union, the committee recommended that the European Parliament waive the immunity of António Marinho e Pinto.
