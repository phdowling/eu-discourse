2016/2268(BUD) - 19/10/2016 Commission draft budget
PURPOSE: to present Draft Amending Budget (DAB) No 6/2016 to mobilise the European Union Solidarity Fund to assist Germany hit by
severe floods.
CONTENT: Draft Amending Budget (DAB) No 6 for the year 2016 covers the mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF) for
an amount of EUR 31 475 125 in commitment and payment appropriations. The mobilisation relates to floods in Germany.
Germany: late August 2016, the Commission received an application for EUSF financial assistance relating to natural disasters in Germany
(floods in May/June 2016).
The Commission services have carried out a thorough examination of the application. The most important elements of the assessments are
summarised below:
the application from Germany was received on 19 August 2016, within the deadline of 12 weeks after the first damage was recorded
on 28 May 2016. (4) Germany did not request the payment of an advance.
the German authorities estimated the total direct damage caused by the disaster at EUR 1 259,005 million. This amount represents
38% of the major disaster threshold for mobilising the EUSF of EUR 3 312,242 million applicable to Germany in 2016 (i.e. EUR 3
billion in 2011 prices).

Direct damage: as total direct damage remains below the major disaster threshold for activating the Solidarity Fund the application was
presented and examined on the basis of the criteria for "regional disasters (a 'regional disaster' is defined as any natural disaster resulting in a
region at NUTS level 2 of an eligible State in direct damage in excess of 1.5% of that region's GDP).
The German application relates to a single NUTS level 2 region, namely 'Niederbayern (DE22)'. The reported direct damage of EUR 1 259,005
million represents 3.03% of the region's GDP (EUR 41 522 million based on 2014 data) and exceeds the 1.5% threshold of article 2(3) of the
Regulation.
The application from Germany is therefore eligible for a contribution from the Solidarity Fund.
Damaged caused by the disaster: as regards the impact and consequences of the disaster, the Commission stated that an area of
approximately 430 km2 with about 5 000 homes, was flooded in the district of Rottal-Inn. At the time of application, over 2 000 people were still
unable to return to their houses and had to seek provisional accommodation.
In total, more than 47 000 people in Lower Bavaria were affected and seven people lost their lives. The events caused significant damage to
businesses and agriculture. In addition, heavy damage to the basic infrastructure was reported: traffic routes such as railway lines, local and
national roads were rendered impassable, leading to serious traffic problems.
The cost of essential emergency operations has been estimated by the German authorities at EUR 94.196 million and has been broken down
by type of operation. The largest share of the cost of emergency operations (over EUR 52.227 million) concerns recovery operations in the
field of transport. The second largest share of cost concerns the cleaning-up measures amounting to EUR 21.083 million.
Financing: on the basis of the requests for intervention presented by Germany, the Commission proposes to mobilise the following aid amount:
Direct damage Germany: EUR 1 259,055 million.
Aid proposed: EUR 31 475 125.
Total: EUR 31 475 125.
This is the second proposal for a mobilisation decision of the European Union Solidarity Fund in 2016. The total amount of aid proposed above
complies with the ceiling provisions of the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) regulation of EUR 552 040 402 (i.e. EUR 500 million in
2011 prices).
In addition, in accordance with Article 10(1) of the Council Regulation on the multiannual financial framework, as the 2015 allocation of EUR
541 216 080 remained unspent, it is carried over for one year to 2016. Therefore, the total remaining amount for mobilisations of the EUSF at
the beginning of 2016 was EUR 1 093 256 482. The remaining unspent amount is currently EUR 1 091 604 648, following the first 2016
mobilisation proposal (EUR 1 651 834, earthquake in the Ionian Islands, Greece).
In conclusion, the Commission proposes to mobilise the European Union Solidarity Fund for the case of Germany and to amend the budget
2016 by increasing budget article 13 06 01 'Assistance to Member States in the event of a major natural disaster with serious repercussions on
living conditions, the natural environment or the economy' by EUR 31 475 125 both in commitment and in payment appropriations.
As the European Union Solidarity Fund is a special instrument as defined in the MFF regulation, the corresponding appropriations should be
budgeted outside the corresponding MFF ceilings.

2016/2268(BUD) - 21/11/2016 Council position on draft budget
On 19 October 2016, the Commission submitted to the Council draft amending budget (DAB) No 6 to the general budget for 2016 regarding
the mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund for a total amount of EUR 31 475 125 in commitment and payment appropriations.
The objective of this proposal is to provide financial assistance to Germany in response to a series of extremely intense, short-lived cases of
floods that affected the region of Niederbayern in May and June 2016.
The corresponding appropriations are to be recorded under Article 13 06 01 (EU Solidarity Fund - Assistance to Member States in the event of
a major natural disaster with serious repercussions on living conditions, the natural environment or the economy).
On 15 November 2016, the Council adopted its position on DAB No 6 to the general budget for 2016 as set out in the annex to the Council
document 13852/16.

2016/2268(BUD) - 25/11/2016 Budgetary report tabled for plenary, 1st reading
The Committee on Budgets adopted the report by José Manuel FERNANDES (EPP, PT) on the Council position on Draft amending budget No
6/2016 of the European Union for the financial year 2016 accompanying the proposal to mobilise the European Union Solidarity Fund to
provide assistance to Germany.
As a reminder, the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF) is a special instrument as defined in the Multi-annual Financial Framework (MFF)
Regulation, and the corresponding commitment and payments appropriations are to be budgeted over and above the MFF ceilings.

Germany in May and June 2016.
With this proposal, the Commission proposes to amend the 2016 budget and increase the budget article 13 06 01 'Assistance to Member
States in the event of a major natural disaster with serious repercussions on living conditions, the natural environment or the economy' by EUR
31 475 125 both in commitment and in payment appropriations.
The committee called on Parliament to approve the Council position on Draft amending budget No 6/2016.

2016/2268(BUD) - 01/12/2016 Final act
