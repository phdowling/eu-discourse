2016/2305(INI) - 14/09/2016 Document attached to the procedure
PURPOSE: to present an action plan for the rapid and coordinated deployment of 5G networks in Europe.
BACKGROUND: the Digital Agenda for Europe and the Commission communication "Connectivity for a Competitive Digital Single Market Towards a European Gigabit Society" stress the importance of having very high capacity networks such as 5G to enable Europe to compete in
the global market.
According to the Commission, revenues generated by 5G worldwide are expected to be equivalent to EUR 225 billion by 2025. Another source
indicates that the benefits of introducing 5G in four major industrial sectors could reach EUR 114 billion per year.

A lack of coordination between the different national approaches to the deployment of 5G networks would create a significant risk of
fragmentation in terms of frequency availability, continuity of services across borders (for connected vehicles, for example) and the
implementation of standards.
For this reason, the Commission proposes an action plan as a means of promoting appropriate coordination.
CONTENT: in addition to the new regulatory framework envisaged by the Commission and the proposed measures in the European electronic
communications code, this communication presents an action plan for the rapid and coordinated deployment of 5G networks in Europe, by
means of a partnership between the Commission, the Member States and the sector.
The proposed plan aims to create momentum for investment in 5G networks and to create new innovative ecosystems, thereby enhancing
European competitiveness and delivering tangible benefits to society.
The Commission intends to base the plan around the following essential elements:
setting in place a common timetable for the launch of the first 5G networks by the end of 2018, followed by the launch of fully
commercial 5G services in Europe by the end of 2020: Member States will be encouraged to set in place by the end of 2017, national
roadmaps on the deployment of 5G in the context of national broadband programmes;
designate, by the end of 2016, a provisional list of frequency bands for the launch of 5G services;
agree, by the end of 2017, on all the frequency bands (below and above 6 GHz) to be harmonised for the initial deployment of
commercial 5G networks in Europe;
promote early deployment in large urban areas and along major transport routes;
continue the deployment, starting in 2018, of a selection of 5G tests with a clear European dimension;
encourage Member States to consider using the future 5G infrastructure to improve the performance of communications services used
for public safety and security;
facilitate, in cooperation with the sector and the EIB group, the establishment of a venture capital financing mechanism for 5G;
support innovative European start-ups aimed at developing 5G technologies and related new applications in different industrial
sectors;
ensure the availability of the initial global 5G standards by the end of 2019 and bring together key players to work towards the
promotion of global standards.
The European Parliament and the Council are invited to approve the action plan for 5G.

2016/2305(INI) - 14/09/2016 Document attached to the procedure
PURPOSE: to pave the way for better internet connectivity to prepare for the digital future.
BACKGROUND: in 2010, the Digital Agenda for Europe defined objectives for connectivity by 2020: universal availability at 30 Mbps, to
ensure territorial cohesion, and subscriptions at 100 Mbps by at least 50% of European households, to anticipate future competitiveness
needs.
In 2015, fixed networks offering at least 30 Mbps were available to 71% of homes across the EU. Subscriptions at 100 Mbps+ are growing
sharply, from a low base: 11% of all homes had such subscriptions by mid-2015. However, there are still substantial differences between
Member States, and between urban and rural areas, in both coverage and take-up.
While basic broadband is available to every European, the Commission noted that this is no longer good enough for the ongoing digital
transformation.
In its resolution of 19 January 2016, the European Parliament underlined the role of private investment in Internet connectivity networks for
digital progress and the role of a stable regulatory framework in enabling all players to invest in all areas, including rural and remote ones.
CONTENT: this communication confirms the importance of Internet connectivity for the Digital Single Market and the need for Europe to
deploy now the networks for its digital future.
To this end, it sets out a vision for a European Gigabit society. This vision is operationalised through three strategic objectives for 2025. To
help make this vision a reality, this communication proposes a series of initiatives designed to establish the right conditions for the necessary
investments to take place, primarily to be achieved by the market.
Strategic objectives for 2025: while the 2010 connectivity objectives remain valid up to 2020, the Commission sets out three complementary
strategic objectives to meet the digital challenge:
high-speed gigabit connectivity (allowing users to send and receive a gigabit of data per second) for places driving socio-economic
developments such as in schools, universities, research centres, transport platforms, public services such as hospitals and public
administrations, as well as businesses that rely on digital technologies;
access for all European households to Internet connectivity offering at least 100 Mbps;
5G coverage for all urban areas and all major terrestrial transport paths. An intermediate objective for 2020 is for 5G connectivity to be
available as a fully-fledged commercial service in at least one major city in each Member State, building on commercial introduction in
2018.
Adapting the policy and legal framework for investment: according to estimates, an overall investment of around EUR 500 billion over the
coming decade is required to reach the vision and objectives for 2025.
The proposed initiatives consist of a major reform of the regulatory framework for electronic communications, in the form of the accompanying
legislative proposal for a European Electronic Communications Code (the Code) and Body of European Regulators for Electronic
Communications (BEREC) Regulation.
The European Electronic Communications Code presented by the Commission proposes the following:
incentives for deployment and take-up of very high-capacity networks in competitive markets: the aim is to enable adequate returns on

new investments relative to risks, giving Europe-wide predictability to the international investment community, while leaving adequate
scope for adaptation to localised network conditions;
spectrum rules for mobile connectivity and 5G: the proposed Code establishes: (i) key principles for spectrum assignment in the
Union, new Union-level instruments to establish assignment deadlines and licence periods (minimum 25 years), and a peer review
among national regulators to ensure consistent assignment practices; (ii) consistent approach to coverage obligations, to small-cell
deployment and to network sharing, thereby stimulating 5G deployment and rural connectivity; (iii) facilitates spectrum sharing in 5G
networks, and promotes end-user access to Wi-Fi-based connectivity;
improved consumer protection: the proposed Code: (i) modernises end-user switching rights, including for bundles; (ii) ensures that
vulnerable end-users have a right to an affordable connectivity contract; (iii) secures a fair internal market through maximum
harmonisation of the main sector-specific end-user rules.
In addition to legislative and regulatory measures, the Commission also proposes the following:
an action plan for high performance 5G connectivity in Europe: according to a recent study, the successful deployment of 5G could
bring about EUR 113 billion per annum in benefits in four industries (automotive, healthcare, transport and utilities), with benefits
widely spread over business, consumers and wider society. In addition, 5G deployment could support the creation of more than two
million jobs in the EU;
further policy and financial measures, at Union, national and local levels, including a "Wi-Fi for Europe" initiative to promote
widespread availability of Wi-Fi connections for citizens across the EU.
The Commission calls on Member States to review progress of their National Broadband Plans and update them by the end of 2017 with a
time horizon of 2025. In cooperation with the Committee of the Regions, it will set up by the end of 2016 a participatory broadband platform to
ensure a high level of engagement.

2016/2305(INI) - 05/05/2017 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Industry, Research and Energy adopted an own-initiative report by Micha? BONI (EPP, PL) on internet connectivity for
growth, competitiveness and cohesion: European gigabit society and 5G.
Recognising that 5G will be a key building block of the gigabit society, Members welcomed the Commissions action plan aimed at making the
EU a world leader in the deployment of standardised 5G networks from 2020 to 2025.
5G vision: Members stressed the importance of adequate coordination among the Member States, so as to prevent the same kinds of delays
in the rollout of 5G that were experienced with 4G. They emphasised the importance of an ambitious timeline for spectrum allocation within the
Union if Europe is to be in the lead regarding the development of 5G technology.
Certain conditions need to be fulfilled in order to enable the development of 5G infrastructure:
private investments should be supported by an infrastructure-oriented policy and regulatory environment tailored to predictability and
certainty and aimed at promoting competition to the benefit of the end users;
all sectors - academia, research institutions, the private sector and the public sector on research and development should be involved
in the process;
the deployment of fibre backhaul infrastructure, competition for driving investment and high-quality end user experiences should be
prioritised;
a maximum number of EU citizens should be able to benefit from gigabit society connectivity, including those living in remote areas;
a coherent European spectrum strategy, including coordinated national roadmaps and timetables, is needed in order to ensure a
smooth transition period towards 5G in all Member States;
spectrum allocation should be harmonised in order to ensure the consistency of decisions and concerted EU-wide efforts should be
made to manage the accessibility of 700 MHz and frequencies ranging from 1GHz to 100 GHz in the long term;
all sector players should benefit from a predictable level playing field that drives competition and should enjoy the flexibility to design
their own networks.
Enabling gigabit society benefits: the report underlined that 5G and 5G applications will reinvent business models by providing very high
speed connectivity, which will unlock innovation in all sectors, not least transport, energy, finance and health. The deployment of 5G
technologies in Europe is expected to have benefits amounting to EUR 141.8 billion annually by 2025.
Members stressed the following:
any decision made in the rollout of 5G technologies should always remain oriented towards the ultimate purpose of offering end users
affordable, trustworthy and high-quality services;
fair competition and a level playing field for market participants are key necessities for the deployment of the gigabit society by market
participants; the principle of same services, same risk, same rules should apply in this respect;
a competitive legislative framework and initiatives are required, which encourage investments in infrastructure, particularly in order to
tackle the digital divide between urban and rural areas.
Policy approach: Members believed that the best path towards the gigabit society lies in a future-proof, pro-competitive and technology-neutral
approach supported by a broad range of investment models such as public-private or co-investments.
All decisions related to spectrum allocation and 5G deployment, must be formulated based on future needs and how the market is expected to
develop over the next 10-15 years; a successful 5G deployment can only be achieved through far-sighted European legislation and policy
coordination.
The Commission should:
ensure, long-term financing for the 5G Action Plan and the network modernisation at the appropriate level within the horizon of the
next Multiannual Financial Framework 2020-2027;
take the lead in promoting intersectoral, cross-lingual 5G and cross-border interoperability and supporting privacy-friendly, reliable,

secure services;
consider setting a concrete and appealing target as a framework for private sector experimentation with 5G technologies and
products;
detail its action plans to facilitate the participation of SMEs and start-ups in experimentation with 5G technologies and to ensure them
access to the 5G Participatory Broadband Platform.
For their part, Member States should:
implement the 5G Action Plan fully through coherent, inclusive and timely action in regions and cities;
implement rapidly the provisions in Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2016 concerning
measures for a high common level of security of network and information systems across the Union.
The report calls for:
stepping up efforts on standardisation with a view to ensuring that Europe plays a leading role in setting technology standards allowing
for the deployment of 5G networks and services;
adopting effective measures to fight piracy and a comprehensive approach to improve the enforcement of intellectual property rights to
ensure easy routes to legal content for consumers;
encouraging the development of integrated solutions and tests followed by cross-industry trials of large-scale pilots in response to
demand for services in the gigabit society;
adopting clear, common EU rules in order to preserve affordability and consumer choice.
Members supported EU-level initiatives to ensure greater spectrum coordination between Member States and long-term licence durations.
They also called on the EU to coordinate efforts within the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) with a view to ensuring coherent EU
policy.

2016/2305(INI) - 01/06/2017 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 516 to 65, with 42 abstentions, a resolution on internet connectivity for growth, competitiveness and
cohesion: European gigabit society and 5G.
