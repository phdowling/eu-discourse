Summary

2016/2881(RSP) - 15/09/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a resolution on Somalia.
The text adopted in plenary had been tabled by the EPP, S&D, ECR, ALDE, Greens/EFA and EFDD groups.
Parliament recalled that the people of Somalia are struggling and suffering the consequences of continuous barbaric attacks by warlords and
terrorists.
On 30 August 2016, at least 10 people, including soldiers and civilians, were killed in Mogadishu outside the Presidential Palace and on 26
July 2016 Al-Shabab targeted the African Union base in Mogadishu, killing at least 13 people, including UN personnel.
It recalled that Al-Shabab also remains active in neighbouring Kenya, where it commits regular terrorist attacks.
While strongly condemning the perpetrators of the terrorist attacks, Members welcomed the government and regional leaders endorsement of
a new National Security Policy, calling on the government to accelerate its implementation in view of the remaining threat posed by Al-Shaba.
They called on the EU and its international partners to remain strongly committed to cooperating with Somalia in building legitimate institutions
and a Somali-owned security sector to combat terrorism and provide protection for all people.
AMISON: Parliament called on the African Union (AU) to ensure that all troop-contributing countries share information with the CCTARC
(AMISOM Civilian Casualty Tracking, Analysis and Response Cell) regarding reports of or investigations into civilian casualties. AMISOM, the
22 000-strong African Union peacekeeping mission, is mandated, inter alia, to reduce the threat posed by Al-Shabab and other armed
opposition groups.
It also called for better EU monitoring and capacity building to ensure accountability for abuses by AMISOM, especially given the fact that the
EU is responsible for the bulk of its funding.
Elections: Parliament highlighted the encouraging progress made towards more inclusive elections and accountable government since 2012. It
recognised the positive contributions that the UN Support Office in Somalia (UNSOS) has made in supporting the gains made by AMISOM and
the UN Assistance Mission in Somalia (UNSOM) by contributing troops, financial and material resources in order to guarantee the protection of
the civilian population in Somalia.
It urged the Somali National Army and AMISOM to take all action necessary to stop any attempts by the militant insurgent group Al-Shabab to
disrupt the upcoming electoral process. It underlined that securing the electoral process should be the key priority.
Child soldiers: Members condemned the recruitment and use of children by security forces as soldiers and as informants, including the use of
captured or deserting child soldiers. They called for stronger measures to protect children affected by armed conflict and from recruitment and
use by armed forces and groups.
They also recalled that there cannot be security without development, or development without security.
Refugees: Parliament called for the strengthening of programmes to fight underdevelopment to ensure the sustainable reintegration of
returning refugees into the country. It is deeply concerned about the attacks against humanitarian actors in Somalia. Lastly, Parliament called
on the Somali Federal Government and all actors involved to find sustainable concrete solutions to the problems of displaced persons.
