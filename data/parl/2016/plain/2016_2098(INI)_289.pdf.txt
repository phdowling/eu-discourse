2016/2098(INI) - 05/04/2017 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted an own-initiative report by Nedzhmi ALI (ADLE, BG) on the annual report on the control of the
financial activities of the EIB for 2015.
It made the following recommendations:
Enhancing the sustainability of the EIBs investment policy: while welcoming the EIBs annual reports for 2015, the report called on the EIB to
further refine and provide information on the concrete and achieved economic, social and environmental impact, and added value, of its
operations in the Member States and outside the EU.
Members strongly encouraged the EIB to continue its efforts to overcome investment, market and sectoral gaps and to invest in projects and
operations which have real added value for achieving greater EU economic, social and territorial cohesion, a stronger investment environment,
higher employment and the return of sustainable growth across the EU.
The EU should in particular:
better anticipate structural challenges, notably those related to Europes re-industrialisation and the knowledge-based and digital
economy, in order to generate new economic opportunities, innovation, the development of a circular economy and better use of
renewables;
assess funded projects not only in terms of economic relevance but also with an equally strong focus on environmental and social
sustainability;
step up the dissemination of their financing possibilities, as well as their support and advice, to increase funding for projects of local
and regional authorities and SMEs;
take account of the less developed countries and regions given that 73 % of the EIBs total lending for 2015 is concentrated in six
Member States.
Members considered it fundamental that the EIB keep its triple-A rating in order to preserve its access to international capital markets under
the best borrowing conditions.
Monitoring the EIBs impact in the implementation of key public policy areas: Members regretted that there is no information provided in the
2015 Annual Report on the EIB operations inside the EU about expected and achieved results from the Bank operations with regard to its two
cross-cutting policy objectives, namely climate action and cohesion; is concerned that in 2015 the EIB did not reach the envisaged level of 30
% investments for cohesion (25.2 % achieved inside the EU).
The EIB is called upon to reinstate economic, social and territorial cohesion as a primary public policy goal and to start explicit reporting on its
implementation and to continue to define its monitoring indicators, more specifically indicators of additionality.
Funding schemes for SMEs: Members noted that the EIBs support to SMEs accounted for approximately 36.6 % of its funding in 2015,
triggering a leverage effect of EUR 39.7 billion for SME finance and supporting 5 million jobs. They welcomed the EIF efforts to make the SME

Initiative work. They also welcomed the European Investment Funds efforts to make the SME Initiative work currently in six countries (Spain,
Italy, Bulgaria, Finland, Romania and Malta), as well as the proposal of the Commission to prolong the SME Initiative until 2020.
The EIB is invited to increase its intervention risk profile, especially when supporting SMEs which are taking risks or evolving in economically
disadvantaged regions.
Members also recommended that the EIB should:
continue to support infrastructure agenda based on efficient projects of common interest in the transport and energy sectors with their
own resources and by implementing the Debt Financial Instruments under the Connected Europe Facility;
continue to pay particular attention to investments in R&D (loans to innovative projects in 2015 amounted to a record level of EUR
18.7 billion);
strengthen cooperation with national, regional and local authorities together with National Promotional Banks and Institutions in order
to create more synergies between the ESI Funds and EIB financing instruments and loans;
focus its climate action on the sustainability of cross-sector projects in the context of the COP21 targets and to support the expansion
of renewable energies;
support EU external policies and emergency response related to the global challenge of migration;
pay particular attention to the principle of additionality and to provide relevant qualitative management information on the
implementation of the European Funds for Strategic Investment (EFSI) stated objectives; the widest possible geographical spread
should be considered in the implementation of the EFSI pipeline for the benefit of cohesion and sustainability objective.
Lastly, Members considered that the enhanced economic role of the EIB, its increased investment capacity and the use of the EU budget to
guarantee the EIBs operations must be accompanied by greater transparency and deepened accountability so as to ensure genuine public
scrutiny of its activities, project selection and funding priorities.

2016/2098(INI) - 27/04/2017 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 530 votes to 105, with 12 abstentions, a resolution on the annual report on the control of the financial
activities of the EIB for 2015.
It made the following recommendations:
Enhancing the sustainability of the EIBs investment policy: Members noted that EUR 77.5 billion of operations were signed in 2015, out of
which EUR 69.7 billion went to EU Member States and EUR 7.8 billion went outside the EU.
While welcoming the EIBs annual reports for 2015, Parliament called on the EIB to further refine and provide information on the concrete and
achieved economic, social and environmental impact, and added value, of its operations in the Member States and outside the EU. Members
strongly encouraged the EIB to continue its efforts to overcome investment, market and sectoral gaps and to invest in projects and operations
which have real added value.
The EU should in particular:
better anticipate structural challenges, notably those related to Europes re-industrialisation and the knowledge-based and digital
economy, in order to generate new economic opportunities, innovation, the development of a circular economy and better use of
renewables;
assess funded projects not only in terms of economic relevance but also with an equally strong focus on environmental and social
sustainability;
step up the dissemination of their financing possibilities, as well as their support and advice, to increase funding for projects of local
and regional authorities and SMEs;
take account of the less developed countries and regions given that 73 % of the EIBs total lending for 2015 is concentrated in six
Member States.
Members considered it fundamental that the EIB keep its triple-A rating in order to preserve its access to international capital markets under
the best borrowing conditions.
Monitoring the EIBs impact in the implementation of key public policy areas: Parliament regretted that there is no information provided in the
2015 Annual Report on the EIB operations inside the EU about expected and achieved results from the Bank operations with regard to its two
cross-cutting policy objectives, namely climate action and cohesion; is concerned that in 2015 the EIB did not reach the envisaged level of 30
% investments for cohesion (25.2 % achieved inside the EU).
The EIB is called upon to reinstate economic, social and territorial cohesion as a primary public policy goal and to start explicit reporting on its
implementation and to continue to define its monitoring indicators, more specifically indicators of additionality.
Funding schemes for SMEs: the EIBs support to SMEs accounted for approximately 36.6 % of its funding in 2015, triggering a leverage effect
of EUR 39.7 billion for SME finance and supporting 5 million jobs.
Parliament welcomed the EIF efforts to make the SME Initiative work. It also welcomed the European Investment Funds efforts to make the
SME Initiative work currently in six countries (Spain, Italy, Bulgaria, Finland, Romania and Malta), as well as the proposal of the Commission to
prolong the SME Initiative until 2020.
The EIB is invited to increase its intervention risk profile, especially when supporting SMEs which are taking risks or evolving in economically
disadvantaged regions.
Members also recommended that the EIB should:
continue to support infrastructure agenda based on efficient projects of common interest in the transport and energy sectors with their
own resources and by implementing the Debt Financial Instruments under the Connected Europe Facility;
continue to pay particular attention to investments in R&D (loans to innovative projects in 2015 amounted to a record level of EUR
18.7 billion); as regards dual-use technologies, the EIB should primarily support those investments that are motivated by their

commercialisation in civilian applications;
strengthen cooperation with national, regional and local authorities together with National Promotional Banks and Institutions in order
to create more synergies between the ESI Funds and EIB financing instruments and loans;
focus its climate action on the sustainability of cross-sector projects in the context of the COP21 targets and to support the expansion
of renewable energies;
continue the development of a market for sustainable green projects, promoting above all the creation of a circular economy, in
particular via a green bond market;
support EU external policies and emergency response related to the global challenge of migration by including the development
aspect.
Monitoring of the EFSIs added value and additionality: the projects approved to date represent a total of EUR 115.7 billion of investments out
of a total of EUR 315 billion of additional investments to be leveraged by the European Strategic Investment Fund (EFSI) through the EIB by
2018. Parliament called on the EIB to pay particular attention to the principle of additionality and to provide relevant qualitative management
information on the implementation of the European Funds for Strategic Investment (EFSI) stated objectives.
The EIB is asked to correct the current geographical imbalances within the Union and sectoral concentration of the EFSIs portfolio, by
enhancing its advisory activities for projects development in Member States and by considering expanding the number of sectors eligible for
EFSI funding.
Transparency and accountability: according to Parliament, the enhanced economic role of the EIB, its increased investment capacity and the
use of the EU budget to guarantee the EIBs operations must be accompanied by greater transparency and deepened accountability so as to
ensure genuine public scrutiny of its activities, project selection and funding priorities.
