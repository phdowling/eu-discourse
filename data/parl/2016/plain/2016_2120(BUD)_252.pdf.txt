2016/2120(BUD) - 30/06/2016 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: to mobilise the Flexibility Instrument to finance immediate budgetary measures to address the on-going migration, refugee and
security crisis.
PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
CONTENT: Council Regulation (EU, EURATOM) No 1311/2013 of 2 December 2013 laying down the multiannual financial framework for the
years 2014-2020 allows for the mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument to allow the financing of clearly identified expenditure which could not
be financed within the limits of the ceilings available for one or more headings of the multiannual financial framework.
In accordance with Article 11 of Council Regulation No 1311/2013 and point 12 of the Interinstitutional Agreement between the European
Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline, on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial
management, after having examined all possibilities for re-allocating appropriations and exhausted any unallocated margin under the
expenditure heading Security and Citizenship (heading 3), the Commission proposes to mobilise the Flexibility Instrument in 2017, for which
the ceiling on the annual amount available is EUR 471 million (2011 prices) corresponding to EUR 530 million in current prices.
This mobilisation concerns an amount beyond the ceiling of heading 3 of the multiannual financial framework, and is intended to finance
support for measures for managing the migration, refugee and security crisis.

The payment appropriations corresponding to the mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument should be distributed over several financial years
and are estimated at:
EUR 238.3 million in 2017,
EUR 91 million in 2018,
EUR 141.9 million in 2019,
EUR 58.8 million in 2020.
In order to minimise the time taken to mobilise the Flexibility Instrument, it is proposed that this decision should apply from 1 January 2017.

2016/2120(BUD) - 25/11/2016 Budgetary report tabled for plenary, 1st reading
The Committee on Budgets adopted the report by Jens GEIER (S&D, DE) on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of
the Council on the mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument to finance immediate budgetary measures to address the on-going migration,
refugee and security crisis.
As a reminder, the Flexibility Instrument is intended to allow the financing of clearly identified expenditure which could not be financed within
the limits of the ceilings available for one or more other headings.
The 2017 ceilings for heading 3 do not allow for an adequate financing of urgent measures in the field of migration, refugees and security.
Therefore, Members agreed with the proposal to mobilise the Flexibility Instrument for an amount of EUR 530 million in commitment
appropriations.
On the basis of the expected payment profile, the payment appropriations corresponding to the mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument should
be distributed over several financial years and are estimated at:
EUR 238.3 million in 2017,
EUR 91 million in 2018,
EUR 141.9 million in 2019,
EUR 58.8 million in 2020.
Members reiterated that the mobilisation of this instrument, as provided for in Article 11 of the MFF Regulation, shows, once more, the crucial
need for the Union budget to be more flexible. They reiterated their position expressed in the framework of the MFF mid-term review/revision
that the annual amount of the Flexibility Instrument be increased to EUR 2 billion.

2016/2120(BUD) - 01/12/2016 Budgetary text adopted by Parliament
The European Parliament adopted by 526 votes to 70, with 44 abstentions, a resolution on the proposal for a decision of the European
Parliament and of the Council on the mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument to finance immediate budgetary measures to address the
on-going migration, refugee and security crisis.
Parliament recalled that the Flexibility Instrument is intended to allow the financing of clearly identified expenditure which could not be financed
within the limits of the ceilings available for one or more other headings.
The 2017 ceilings for heading 3 do not allow for an adequate financing of urgent measures in the field of migration, refugees and security.
Therefore, Parliament agreed with the proposal to mobilise the Flexibility Instrument for an amount of EUR 530 million in commitment
appropriations.
On the basis of the expected payment profile, the payment appropriations corresponding to the mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument should
be distributed over several financial years and are estimated at:
EUR 238.3 million in 2017,
EUR 91 million in 2018,
EUR 141.9 million in 2019,
EUR 58.8 million in 2020.
It reiterated that the mobilisation of this instrument, as provided for in Article 11 of the MFF Regulation, shows, once more, the crucial need for
the Union budget to be more flexible. It also reiterated its position expressed in the framework of the MFF mid-term review/revision that the
annual amount of the Flexibility Instrument be increased to EUR 2 billion.
Parliament also reiterated its long-standing view that, without prejudice to the possibility for payment appropriations to be mobilised for specific
budget lines through the Flexibility Instrument without prior mobilisations in commitments, the payments stemming from commitments
previously mobilised through the Flexibility Instrument can only be counted over and above the ceilings.

2016/2120(BUD) - 14/12/2016 Final act
PURPOSE: to mobilise the flexibility instrument to finance immediate budgetary measures to address the on-going migration, refugee and
security crisis.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision (EU) 2017/342 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the mobilisation of the flexibility
instrument to finance immediate budgetary measures to address the on-going migration, refugee and security crisis.

CONTENT: Council Regulation (EU, EURATOM) No 1311/2013 of 2 December 2013 laying down the multiannual financial framework for the
years 2014-2020 allows for the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument to allow the financing of clearly identified expenditure which could not
be financed within the limits of the ceilings available for one or more headings of the multiannual financial framework.
The ceiling on the annual amount available for the Flexibility Instrument is EUR 471 million (2011 prices), as laid down in Article 11 of Council
Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013.
Due to the urgent needs, it is necessary to mobilise significant additional amounts to finance measures to alleviate the ongoing migration,
refugee and security crisis and after having examined all possibilities for re-allocating appropriations under the expenditure ceiling for
heading 3 (Security and citizenship), it appears necessary to mobilise the flexibility instrument to supplement the financing available in the
general budget of the Union for the financial year 2017, beyond the ceilings of heading 3 by the amount of EUR 530 million to finance
measures in the field of migration, refugees and security.
On the basis of the expected payment profile, the payment appropriations corresponding to the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument will be
as follows:
EUR 238.3 million in 2017,
EUR 91 million in 2018,
EUR 141.9 million in 2019,
EUR 58.8 million in 2020.
The specific amounts for each financial year shall be authorised in accordance with the annual budgetary procedure.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: the Decision shall enter into force on 28.2.2017. It shall apply from 1.1.2017.
