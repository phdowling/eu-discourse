2016/2162(DEC) - 11/07/2016 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: presentation by the Commission of the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2015, as part of
the 2015 discharge procedure.
Analysis of the accounts of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound).
CONTENT: the organisational governance of the EU consists of institutions, agencies and other EU bodies whose expenditure is included in
the general budget of the Union.
The EU's operational expenditure of these institutions takes different forms, depending on how the money is paid out and managed.
From 2014 onwards, the Commission classifies its expenditure as follows:
Direct management: the budget is implemented directly by the Commission services.
Indirect management: the Commission confers tasks of implementation of the budget to bodies of EU law or national law, such as the
EU agencies.
Shared management: under this method of budget implementation tasks are delegated to Member States. About 80 % of the
expenditure falls under this management mode covering such areas as agricultural spending and structural actions.
This Commission document concerns the EU's consolidated accounts for the year 2015 and details how spending by the EU institutions and
bodies was carried out. The consolidated annual accounts of the EU provide financial information on the activities of the institutions, agencies
and other bodies of the EU from an accrual accounting and budgetary perspective.
It is the responsibility of the Commission's Accounting Officer to prepare the EU's consolidated annual accounts and ensure that they present
fairly, in all material aspects, the financial position, the result of the operations and the cashflows of the EU institutions and bodies, including

the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound), with a view to granting discharge.
Discharge procedure: the final step of a budget lifecycle is the discharge of the budget for a given financial year. It represents the political
aspect of the external control of budget implementation and is the decision by which the European Parliament, acting on a Council
recommendation, "releases" the Commission (and other EU bodies) from its responsibility for management of a given budget by marking the
end of that budget's existence. The European Parliament is the discharge authority within the EU.
The discharge procedure may produce three outcomes: (i) the granting; (ii) postponement or; (iii) the refusal of the discharge.
The final discharge report including specific recommendations to the Commission for action is adopted in plenary by the European Parliament
and are subject to an annual follow up report in which the Commission outlines the concrete actions it has taken to implement the
recommendations made.
Each agency is subject to its own discharge procedure, including Eurofound.
Eurofound: the Foundation, which is located in Dublin (IRL), was set up by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1365/75 aims to contribute to the
planning and establishment of better living and working conditions in the Union by increasing and disseminating knowledge which is relevant
to this subject.
As regards the Foundations accounts, these are presented in detail in the document on the consolidated annual accounts of the European
Union for 2015:
Commitment appropriations:
-

committed: EUR 22 million;

-

paid: EUR 22 million;

-

carried-over: 0.

Payment appropriations :
-

committed: EUR 26 million;

-

paid: EUR 23 million;

-

carried-over: EUR 3 million.

For further details on expenditure, please refer to Eurofounds annual accounts.

2016/2162(DEC) - 13/09/2016 Court of Auditors: opinion, report
PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living
and Working Conditions (EUROFOUND) for the financial year 2015, together with the Foundations reply.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit concerned, amongst others, the annual accounts of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions
(EUROFOUND). In brief, the Foundations task is to contribute to the planning and establishment of better living and working conditions in the
Union by increasing and disseminating knowledge which is relevant to this subject.
Statement of Assurance: pursuant to the provisions of Article 287 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the Court
has audited:
the annual accounts of the Foundation, which comprise the financial statements and the reports on the implementation of the budget
for the financial year ended 31 December 2015;
the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying those accounts.
Opinion on the reliability of the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the Foundations annual accounts present fairly, in all material respects, its
financial position as at 31 December 2015 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the
provisions of its Financial Regulation and the accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
Opinion on the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the accounts: the Court considers that the transactions underlying the
annual accounts for the year ended 31 December 2015 are legal and regular in all material respects.
The report also makes a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of the Foundation, accompanied by the latters
response. The main observations may be summarised as follows:
The Courts observations:
budgetary management: the Court noted that the level of committed appropriations carried over to 2016 was high for operational
expenditure at EUR 2 135 164, i.e. 31.2%. These carry-overs are mainly in relation to multiannual projects implemented according to
schedule.
The Foundations replies:
budgetary management: Eurofound acknowledged the observation of the Court
Lastly, the Court of Auditors report contains a summary of the Foundations key figures in 2015:

Budget: EUR 21.2 million (in payment appropriations).
Staff: 111 including officials, temporary and contract staff and seconded national experts.

2016/2162(DEC) - 07/02/2017 Supplementary non-legislative basic document
Having examined the revenue and expenditure accounts for the financial year 2015 and the balance sheet as at 31 December 2015 of the
European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (EUROFOUND), as well as the Court of Auditors' report on the
annual accounts of the Foundation for the financial year 2015, accompanied by the Foundation's replies to the Court's observations, the
Council recommended the European Parliament to give a discharge to the Director of the Foundation in respect of the implementation of the
budget for the financial year 2015.
The Council welcomed the Court's opinion that, in all material respects, the Foundation's annual accounts present fairly its financial position as
at 31 December 2015 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions of the
Foundation's Financial Regulation, and that the underlying transactions for 2015 are legal and regular in all material respects.
Nevertheless, one observation was made:
carry-overs: the Council noted that a high level of commitment appropriations was carried over to 2016. It encouraged the Foundation
to continue improving its financial programming and monitoring of the budget implementation, in order to reduce the level of
commitments carried over to the following financial year to the minimum strictly necessary.

2016/2162(DEC) - 29/03/2017 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Inés AYALA SENDER (S&D, ES) on discharge in respect of the implementation of
the budget of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound) for the financial year 2015.
The committee called on the European Parliament to grant the Director of the Foundation discharge in respect of the implementation of the
Foundations budget for the financial year 2015.
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it had obtained reasonable assurance that the annual accounts of the Foundation for the financial
year 2015 were reliable and that the underlying transactions were legal and regular, Members called on Parliament to approve the closure of
the Foundations accounts. They made, however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is
granted, in addition to the general recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of
EU agencies:
Foundations financial statements: Members note the final budget of the Foundation for the financial year 2015 was EUR 20 860 000
representing an increase of 0.42 % compared to 2014.
Commitments and carry-overs: Members stated that the level of committed appropriations carried forward to 2016 was at
EUR 2 135 164 (31.2 %) for operational expenditure, compared to EUR 3 814 156 (53.7 %) in 2014. They noted that carry-overs may
often be partly or fully justified by the multiannual nature of the agencies operational programmes, do not necessarily indicate
weaknesses in budget planning and implementation and are not always at odds with the budgetary principle of annuality.
Members also made a series of observations regarding the budget and financial management, the prevention and management of conflicts of
interests, procurement and recruitment procedures and internal controls and audits.
On performance, Members noted that the Foundations target of 80 % regarding the number of planned outputs in its work programme was not
achieved, even though the Foundation improved its performance in comparison to 2014. They acknowledged the fact that the reasons why the
Foundation missed the target are principally related to delays by contractors and the scarcity of staff resources. They expressed concern that,
with the current resources outlook, the Foundations pan-European surveys are not secured in the long term as well as that the Foundation
cannot commit to embark on further work, such as on migrants and refugees or undeclared work, despite strongly worded requests by its
governing board.
They also expressed concern at the overall 10 % reduction of staff which has had an impact on the delay of some of the Foundations projects
and contributed to difficult discussions in relation to negative priorities with the governing boards bureau. They called on the Commission to
ensure that potential further cost-saving measures do not hinder the Foundation´s ability to fulfil its mandate.
Lastly, Members noted the high-level impact of the Foundation, particularly in supporting the Union institutions, as reflected in the performance
indicators presented in the consolidated annual activity report.

2016/2162(DEC) - 27/04/2017 Final act
PURPOSE: to grant discharge to the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound) for the financial
year 2015.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision (EU) 2017/1711 of the European Parliament on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of
the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions for the financial year 2015.
CONTENT: with the present decision, the European Parliament grants discharge to the Director of Eurofound for the implementation of the
latters budget for the financial year 2015.
This decision is in line with the European Parliament's resolution adopted on 27 April 2017 and comprises a series of observations that form
an integral part of the discharge decision (please refer to the summary of the opinion of 27 April 2017).
Amongst Parliaments main observations in the resolution accompanying the discharge decision, the latter noted that a comprehensive

headquarters agreement between the Foundation and the Member State hosting the Foundation is marked as completed. The host Member
State is to provide the best possible conditions to ensure the functioning of the Foundation, including multilingual, European-oriented schooling
and appropriate transport connections.

2016/2162(DEC) - 27/04/2017 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament decided to grant discharge to the Director of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working
Conditions (Eurofound) in respect of the implementation of its budget for the financial year 2015.
The vote on the decision on discharge covers the closure of the accounts (in accordance with Annex IV, Article 5 (1)(a) to Parliaments Rules of
Procedure).
Noting that the Court of Auditors has stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the Foundations annual accounts for the financial
year 2015 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Parliament adopted by 511 votes to 108 with 4 abstentions, a
resolution containing a series of recommendations, which form an integral part of the decision on discharge and which add to the general
recommendations set out in the resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies.
These recommendations may be summarised as follows:
Foundations financial statements: Parliament noted the final budget of the Foundation for the financial year 2015 was EUR 20 860 000
representing an increase of 0.42 % compared to 2014.
Commitments and carry-overs: It stated that the level of committed appropriations carried forward to 2016 was at EUR 2 135 164
(31.2 %) for operational expenditure, compared to EUR 3 814 156 (53.7 %) in 2014. It noted that carry-overs may often be partly or
fully justified by the multiannual nature of the agencies operational programmes, do not necessarily indicate weaknesses in budget
planning and implementation and are not always at odds with the budgetary principle of annuality.
Parliament also made a series of observations regarding the budget and financial management, the prevention and management of conflicts of
interests, procurement and recruitment procedures and internal controls and audits.
On performance, Parliament noted that the Foundations target of 80 % regarding the number of planned outputs in its work programme was
not achieved, even though the Foundation improved its performance in comparison to 2014. It acknowledged the fact that the reasons why the
Foundation missed the target are principally related to delays by contractors and the scarcity of staff resources. It expressed concern that, with
the current resources outlook, the Foundations pan-European surveys are not secured in the long term as well as that the Foundation cannot
commit to embark on further work, such as on migrants and refugees or undeclared work, despite strongly worded requests by its governing
board.

projects and contributed to difficult discussions in relation to negative priorities with the governing boards bureau. They called on the
Commission to ensure that potential further cost-saving measures do not hinder the Foundation´s ability to fulfil its mandate.
Members noted the high-level impact of the Foundation, particularly in supporting the Union institutions, as reflected in the performance
indicators presented in the consolidated annual activity report.
Collaboration with the Parliament: Parliament acknowledged the Foundations progress in the implementation of the current four-year
programme for 2013 to 2016 on research to assist the development of social and labour policies.
It noted the start of the European Parliaments pilot project, The future of manufacturing in Europe and considered it to be important to maintain
strong cooperation between the Foundation and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in order to continue to engage in
constructive and evidence-based discussions.
