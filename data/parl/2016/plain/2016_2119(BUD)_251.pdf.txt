2016/2119(BUD) - 30/06/2016 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: to mobilise the European Union Solidarity Fund to provide for the payment of advances in the general budget of the Union for
2017.
PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
CONTENT: Council Regulation (EU, EURATOM) No 1311/2013 of 2 December 2013 laying down the multiannual financial framework for the
years 2014-2020, and in particular Article 10 thereof allows for the mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund, within an annual ceiling
of EUR 500 000 000 (2011 prices), over and above the relevant headings of the financial framework.
Point 11 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 2 December 2013 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on
budgetary discipline, on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management2 sets out the modalities for the mobilisation of
the Fund.
The conditions of eligibility to the Fund are detailed in Council Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002 establishing the European Union Solidarity
Fund, which foresees that an amount of up to a maximum of EUR 50 million in both commitment and payment appropriations shall be included
in the budget for the payment of advances.
The Commission considers it necessary to provide for this mobilisation in order to ensure the timely availability of budgetary resources and
therefore proposes to include this amount in the Draft Budget 2017.

2016/2119(BUD) - 14/11/2016 Budgetary report tabled for plenary, 1st reading
The Committee on Budgets adopted the report by Patricija ULIN (EPP, SI) on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of
the Council on the mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund to provide for the payment of advances in the general budget of the
Union for 2017.

Members recalled that the current proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council is not linked to a specific disaster.
Instead, it aims at entering into the general budget of the Union for 2017 the amount of EUR 50 million in commitment and payment
appropriations for the payment of advances in a timely and efficient way in the event of a disaster occurring next year.
This is the direct result of a new provision in the 2014 Amending Regulation (Art. 4a), strongly defended by the European Parliament, which
aims at speeding up the disbursement of aid to affected countries through the payment of an advance before the final award decision has
been taken, thus enhancing the Fund's effectiveness.
The report recalled that the EUSF is not simply another form of EU financial support, but that it also contributes to sending a clear political
message of solidarity, while providing much-needed assistance to affected citizens. A prompt response capacity, including through the
payment of an advance, will help the Union achieve these objectives.
Therefore the committee called on the European Parliament to approve its decision annexed to the draft resolution in order to ensure that the
EU 50 million is included in the 2017 Budget.

2016/2119(BUD) - 01/12/2016 Budgetary text adopted by Parliament
The European Parliament adopted by 640 votes to 24, with 7 abstentions, a resolution on the proposal for a decision of the European
Parliament and of the Council on the mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund to provide for the payment of advances in the general
budget of the Union for 2017.
Parliament recalled that the current proposal is not linked to a specific disaster. Instead, it aims at entering into the general budget of the Union
for 2017 the amount of EUR 50 million in commitment and payment appropriations for the payment of advances in a timely and efficient way in
the event of a disaster occurring next year.
In parallel, Parliament approved the decision annexed to the draft resolution in order to ensure that the EU 50 million is included in the 2017
Budget.

2016/2119(BUD) - 14/12/2016 Final act
PURPOSE: to mobilise the European Union Solidarity Fund to provide for the payment of advances in the general budget of the Union for
2017.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision (EU) 2017/343 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the mobilisation of the European Union
Solidarity Fund to provide for the payment of advances in the general budget of the Union for 2017.
CONTENT: Council Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002 provides that, where necessary in order to ensure the timely availability of budgetary
resources, the Fund may be mobilised in an amount of up to EUR 50 000 000 for the payment of advances, entering the corresponding
appropriations into the general budget of the Union.
With this Decision, the European Parliament and the Council mobilised the sum of EUR 50 million in commitment and payment appropriations
from the European Union Solidarity Fund for the payment of advances under the 2017 budget.
