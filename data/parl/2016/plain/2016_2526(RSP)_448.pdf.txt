Summary

2016/2526(RSP) - 03/02/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 337 votes to 286, with 73 abstentions, a resolution on the new Strategy for Womens Rights and Gender
Equality in Europe post?2015.
The text adopted in plenary was tabled by the S&D, ALDE, GUE/NGL and Greens/EFA groups.
Members recalled that the previous Commission strategy for equality between women and men for 2010-2015 was not comprehensive enough
to contribute to gender equality at European and international level. They stated that a new post-2015 strategy will need to provide new
impetus and deliver concrete action to strengthen womens rights and promote gender equality.
Therefore, Members considered it regrettable that the 2016 Commission Work Programme made no specific mention of the EU Strategy for
Gender Equality post-2015 and deplored the fact that on 3 December 2015 the Commission published only a staff working document entitled
Strategic engagement for gender equality 2016-2019.
They deplored the fact that, on 7 December 2015, the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council (EPSCO) could not
agree on an official position regarding several issues in favour of gender equality, including the Women on Boards Directive, which has long
been awaited by Parliament.
However, Members welcomed the Commissions approach on strategic engagement for gender equality, but deplores the lack of concrete
benchmarks and of a dedicated budget, without which progress on targets and indicators is neither measurable nor achievable.
Members called on the Commission to:
adopt a communication on a new Strategy for Gender Equality and Womens Rights 2016-2020 which addresses gender equality
issues and which is in line with the international agenda, namely the Beijing +20 outcome document of 2015 and the new framework
for Gender Equality and Womens Empowerment: Transforming the Lives of Girls and Women through EU External Relations (2016?
2020);
cooperate with Parliament and the Council, and calls for an EU summit on gender equality and womens rights with a view to
identifying the progress made, and to make renewed commitments within the framework of the forthcoming EPSCO Council in March
2016.
