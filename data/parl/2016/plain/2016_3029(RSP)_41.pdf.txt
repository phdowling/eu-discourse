Summary

2016/3029(RSP) - 15/12/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a resolution on support for the thalidomide survivors.
The text adopted in plenary was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ECR, ALDE, GUE/NGL and Greens/EFA groups.
Members recalled that the drug thalidomide was marketed by Chemie Gr端nenthal GmbH in the late 1950s and early 1960s as a safe drug to
treat morning sickness, headaches, coughs, insomnia and the common cold.
This drug resulted in the death and malformation of thousands of babies when taken by pregnant women in many European countries.
Furthermore, independently verified research points to an inexorable inference that in 1970 the Federal Republic of Germany interfered with
the criminal proceedings against Chemie Gr端nenthal GmbH, the German manufacturer of thalidomide. As a consequence, no proper

determination of the guilt of the manufacturer could be established.
Against this background, Parliament urged the Member States and the Commission to coordinate actions and measures seeking to formally
recognise and provide compensation to thalidomide survivor.
Parliament urged the German Federal Government to use the opportunity presented by the forthcoming amendment to the Thalidomide
Foundation Act to allow thalidomide survivors, who have been accredited as such by court-appointed trust schemes or are beneficiaries of
national government schemes, to access the Special Health Fund of the German Conterganstiftung f端r behinderte Menschen (Thalidomide
Foundation for People with Disabilities).
Parliament urged the Commission to create a framework protocol at European level under which all European citizens affected by thalidomide
would receive similar amounts of compensation, regardless of which Member State they are from, and to draw up an EU programme for
assistance and support (including both financial and welfare provisions) for thalidomide victims and their families.
Lastly, Members asked the Gr端nenthal company to shoulder its responsibilities by providing proper compensation and care to those victims
who have yet to be recognised.
