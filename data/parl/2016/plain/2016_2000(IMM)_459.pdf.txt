Summary

2016/2000(IMM) - 18/03/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Legal Affairs unanimously adopted the report by Angel DZHAMBAZKI (ECR, BG) in which it recommended the European
Parliament to waive the immunity of Hermann WINKLER (EPP, DE).
Members stated that the public prosecutors office in Leipzig (Germany) requested the waiver of the parliamentary immunity of Hermann

Winkler, Member of the European Parliament, in connection with launching investigative proceedings concerning an alleged road traffic
offence.
Members recalled that under Article 46(2) of the German Basic Law (Grundgesetz), a Member may not be called to account for a punishable
offence without the permission of Parliament unless apprehended while committing the offence or in the course of the following day.
They noted that the request relates to preliminary investigations into a serious road traffic accident in which Hermann Winkler was involved
and that the alleged offence clearly has no connection with the position of Hermann Winkler as a Member of the European Parliament.
In this regard, Members called on the European Parliament to waive his parliamentary immunity in the case in question.

2016/2000(IMM) - 12/04/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament decided to waive the immunity of Hermann WINKLER (EPP, DE).
To recall, the public prosecutors office in Leipzig (Germany) requested the waiver of the parliamentary immunity of Hermann Winkler, Member
of the European Parliament, in connection with launching investigative proceedings concerning an alleged road traffic offence on 23
September 2015.
The criminal proceedings do not concern any opinion expressed or vote cast in the performance of the duties of a Member of the European
Parliament for the purposes of Article 8 of Protocol No 7 on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Union.
In the light of the information acquired by the committee, there is no reason to assume that the intention underlying the criminal proceedings is
to damage a Members political activity (fumus persecutionis).
Given that the alleged offence thus clearly has no connection with the position of Hermann Winkler as a Member of the European Parliament,
Parliament decided to waive parliamentary immunity in the case in question.
