Summary

PURPOSE: to providing further macro-financial assistance to Tunisia in order to strengthen its economy and implement a structural reform
programme.
PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: Tunisia was the first Mediterranean country to sign an Association Agreement with the EU on 17 July 1995, which came into
force on 1 March 1998.
Tunisia is a country covered by the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) and it should be considered to be eligible to receive
macro-financial assistance from the Union.
In parallel to this political transition process, the Tunisian economy has suffered from continuous domestic unrest, regional instability (including
the impact of the Libyan conflicts) and a weak international environment (particularly in the Union, Tunisias main trading partner). These
unfavourable developments substantially weakened its growth performance, as well as its fiscal and balance of payments positions.
Since 2011, the Union has expressed its unequivocal commitment to supporting Tunisia in its economic and political reform process . It has
increased its financial support to Tunisia, strengthening its cooperation in many fields, including the civil society the electoral system, security,
regional development and social and economic reforms. And it has offered the possibility of concluding a Deep and Comprehensive Free
Trade Area agreement, the negotiations of which were launched in October 2014.
Tunisia reached in mid-April 2013 an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a 24-month Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) in
the amount of USD 1.75 billion, which was approved by the IMF Board on June 2013, and which was subsequently extended until December
2015. It also requested in August 2013 complementary Macro-Financial Assistance (MFA) from the EU. In response, the European
Commission proposed a MFA of EUR 250 million in December 2013 in the form of loans (MFA-I), which the co-legislators raised to EUR 300
million and approved in May 2014 (Decision No 534/2014/EU). This amount is being successfully implemented.
Following the completion of the 6th review of the IMF programme last September, Tunisia requested a successor arrangement with the IMF,
probably of a 4-year duration. The new IMF programme is still under negotiation but expected to be sent for IMF Board approval in the spring
of 2016.
In 2015, the Tunisia's economy has been significantly affected by several terrorist attacks that have targeted key economic industries like
tourism and transport as well as aiming to disrupt the consolidation of its political transition. In this context, Tunisia requested a second MFA
operation from the EU in the amount of EUR 500 million, which would accompany the successor IMF programme.
CONTENT: the proposal seeks to make MFA available to Tunisia for a total maximum amount of EUR 500 million, provided in the form of a
medium term loan. The assistance will contribute to cover Tunisia's residual external financing needs in 2016-17, as identified by the
Commission based on the estimates of the IMF.
The assistance, to be disbursed in three instalments (EUR 200 million, EUR 150 million and EUR 150 million, respectively), should help the
country overcome its difficult economic and balance of payments situation it is experiencing, which has been exacerbated by the terrorist
attacks it suffered in 2015 and by persistent domestic and regional unrest. It will also promote structural reforms aimed at raising sustainable
economic growth and improving public finance management.
The assistance will be managed by the Commission. The disbursements would be conditional on successful programme reviews under the
new IMF's financial arrangement. Specific provisions on the prevention of fraud and other irregularities, consistent with the Financial
Regulation, are applicable.
The Commission will target structural reforms aimed at improving the overall macroeconomic management and the conditions for sustainable
growth (e.g. targeting the transparency and efficiency of public finance management; fiscal reforms; reforms to strengthen the social safety
net; labour market reforms; and reforms to improve the regulatory framework for trade and investment).
In addition, the Commission and the Tunisian authorities would agree on specific structural reform measures in a Memorandum of
Understanding.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the planned assistance would be provided in the form of a loan and should be financed through a borrowing
operation that the Commission will conduct on behalf of the EU. The budgetary costs of the assistance will correspond to the provisioning, at a
rate of 9%, of the amounts disbursed in the guarantee fund for external lending of the EU , from budget line 01 03 06 ("the provisioning of the
Guarantee Fund").
Assuming that the first and second loan disbursements will be made in 2016 for a total amount of EUR 350 million and the third loan
disbursement in 2017 for the amount of EUR 150 million, and according to the rules governing the guarantee fund mechanism, the
provisioning will take place in the 2018-2019 budgets.
The implications on expenditure (including human resources and administrative costs) are estimated at EUR 45.295 million for 2016-2019.

2016/0039(COD) - 26/05/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on International Trade adopted the report by Marielle DE SARNEZ (EPP, FR) on the proposal for a decision of the European
Parliament and of the Council providing further macro-financial assistance to Tunisia.
The committee recomended that the European Parliament should adopt its position at first reading taking over the Commission proposal.
To recall, the proposal seeks to provide further macro-financial assistance to Tunisia which is currently going through very great difficulties.
Despite all these challenges, Tunisia continues to make very significant progress, firmly establishing democratic transition in the country,
carrying out the reforms needed to modernise its economy and bolstering its relations with its partners, in particular the European Union, with
which it is currently negotiating a free-trade agreement. This is why Members support the proposal for a second MFA programme for Tunisia,

totalling EUR 500 million, which will be granted in the form of medium-term financial-market loans on advantageous conditions. This
assistance programme will back up the efforts made by Tunisia to improve its budgetary position and balance of payments and bring about a
climate more conducive to investment. Members fully endorse this proposal.

2016/0039(COD) - 08/06/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 561 votes to 76, with 42 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a decision of the
European Parliament and of the Council providing further macro-financial assistance to Tunisia.
Parliament adopted its position at first reading taking over the Commission proposal.
To recall, the text seeks to propose further macro-financial assistance of EUR 500 million to Tunisia in the form of a loan.
This assistance programme aims to support reforms undertaken by Tunisia to overcome its difficult economic and balance of payments
situation and to create a more favourable climate to promote investment.

2016/0039(COD) - 06/07/2016 Final act
PURPOSE: to provide macro-financial assistance to Tunisia in order to support economic stabilisation of the country and its structural reform
agenda, and thus to contribute to its external financing needs.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision (EU) 2016/1112 of the European Parliament and of the Council providing further macro-financial assistance to
Tunisia.
CONTENT: by this Decision, the Union makes macro-financial assistance of a maximum amount of EUR 500 million available to Tunisia , with
a view to supporting Tunisia's economic stabilisation and a substantive reform agenda. The assistance shall contribute to covering Tunisia's
balance of payments needs as identified in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme.
Tunisia is a country covered by the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) and it should be considered to be eligible to receive
macro-financial assistance from the Union. Since 2011, the Union has expressed its unequivocal commitment to supporting Tunisia in its
economic and political reform process. It has increased its financial support to Tunisia, strengthening its cooperation in many fields, including
the civil society the electoral system, security, regional development and social and economic reforms.
In 2015, the Tunisia's economy has been significantly affected by several terrorist attacks that have targeted key economic industries like
tourism and transport as well as aiming to disrupt the consolidation of its political transition. Those attacks have had a negative impact on the
economic recovery Tunisia was beginning to experience.
Together with persistent regional instability (including the reactivation of the Libyan conflict), and the still weak European and global economic
environment, those events have exacerbated Tunisia's already weak balance of payments and fiscal positions. This has resulted in significant
external and budgetary financial gaps.
In this challenging context, the Union has reaffirmed its commitment to supporting Tunisia in its economic and political reform process.
Loans: the Union's macro-financial assistance shall be made available for a period of two and a half years. It shall be made available in three
loan instalments. The loans shall have a maximum average maturity of 15 years.
Economic policy and financial conditions focusing on structural reforms and sound public finances, to which the Union's macro-financial
assistance is to be subject, will be laid down in a Memorandum of Understanding to be concluded between the Commission and the Tunisian
authorities. The detailed financial terms of the Union's macro-financial assistance shall be laid down in a Loan Agreement.
Conditions: a pre-condition for granting assistance shall be that Tunisia respects effective democratic mechanisms, and guarantees respect for
human rights.
In addition, the specific objectives of the Union's macro-financial assistance should strengthen the efficiency, transparency and accountability
of the public finance management systems in Tunisia and should promote structural reforms aimed at supporting sustainable and inclusive
growth, employment creation and fiscal consolidation.
The Commission and the European External Action Service shall monitor the fulfilment of the pre-condition throughout the life cycle of the
Union's macro-financial assistance.
In order to ensure that the European Parliament and the Council are able to follow the implementation of this Decision, the Commission should
regularly inform them of developments relating to the assistance and provide them with relevant documents.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 12.7.2016.
