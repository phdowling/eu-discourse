2016/0184(NLE) - 10/06/2016 Initial legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude on behalf of the European Union of the Paris Agreement adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC (known as COP 21), which took place in Paris from 30 November to 12
December 2015, the text of an agreement was adopted, concerning the strengthening of the global response to climate change .
In its communication assessing the implications of the Paris Agreement, the Commission stated that the Paris Agreement should be signed
and ratified as soon as possible. In its conclusions of 18 March 2016, the European Council underlined the need for the European Union and
its Member States to conclude the Paris Agreement as soon as possible and on time so as to be parties as of its entry into force.
As a first step, the Agreement was signed by the Commission and Council on behalf of the European Union and by all 28 Member States on
their behalf at the high-level signature ceremony which took place in New York on 22 April 2016.
The Paris Agreement is in conformity with the environmental objectives of the Union as referred to in Article 191 of the Treaty, namely
preserving, protecting and improving the quality of the environment; protecting human health; and promoting measures at international level to
deal with regional or worldwide environmental problems, and in particular combating climate change.
The 2030 climate and energy policy framework for the EU sets an ambitious economy-wide target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions at
least 40% domestically by 2030, as well as renewable energy and energy efficiency targets of at least 27%. Implementing the 2030 energy
and climate framework is a priority in follow up to the Paris Agreement.
CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council decide to approve, on behalf of the European Union, the Paris Agreement adopted on
12 December 2015 under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
The Paris Agreement is a global milestone for enhancing global collective action and accelerating the global transformation to a low-carbon
and climate resilient society. It will replace the approach taken under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol , that contains commitments until the end of
2020. These commitments will not be continued beyond 2020.
The Paris Agreement sets out a qualitative long-term emissions reduction goal in line with the objective to keep the global temperature
increase well below 2°C and to pursue efforts to keep it to 1.5°C . In order to achieve this goal, the parties will prepare, communicate and
maintain successive nationally determined contributions. Starting from 2023, parties will every 5 years undertake a global stocktake, based on
the latest science and implementation to date, which will track progress and consider emission reductions, adaptation and support provided.

The Agreement will enter into force on the 30th day after the date on which at least 55 parties to the Convention accounting in total for at least
an estimated 55% of global greenhouse gas emissions have deposited their instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession.

PURPOSE: to conclude, on behalf of the European Union, the Paris Agreement adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change (UNFCCC).
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council may only adopt the act if the European Parliament gives its approval.
BACKGROUND: at the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which
took place in Paris from 30 November to 12 December 2015, the text of an agreement was adopted, concerning the strengthening of the
global response to climate change.
The Agreement was signed on 22 April 2016. It should now be concluded on behalf of the Union.
CONTENT: the draft Council decision aims to conclude, on behalf of the European Union, the Paris Agreement adopted on 12 December 2015
under the UNFCCC and the Declaration of Competence attached to the Decision.
The Paris Agreement, inter alia, sets out a long-term goal in line with the objective to keep the global temperature increase well below 2°C
above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to keep it to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. It replaces the approach taken under the 1997
Kyoto Protocol.
The Paris Agreement will enter into force on the 30th day after the date on which at least 55 Parties to the UNFCCC accounting in total for at
least an estimated 55 % of total greenhouse gas emissions have deposited their instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession.
Parties to the UNFCCC include the Union and its Member States.

2016/0184(NLE) - 03/10/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety adopted the report by Giovanni LA VIA (EPP, IT) on the draft Council
decision on the conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Paris Agreement adopted under the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
The committee recommended the European Parliament to give its consent to the conclusion of the Paris Agreement adopted at the 21 st
session of the Conference of the Parties (COP21).
The Paris Agreement:
sets out a long term goal to put the world on track to limit global warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursue
efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C;
sends a clear signal to all stakeholders, investors, businesses, civil society and policy-makers that the global transition to clean energy
is here to stay and that resources have to shift away from fossil fuels;
provides a dynamic mechanism to take stock and strengthen ambition over time. Starting from 2023, Parties will come together every
five years in a "global stocktake" to consider progress in emissions reductions, adaptation and support provided and received in view
of the long-term goals of the Agreement;
obliges parties to pursue domestic mitigation measures;
set up an enhanced transparency and accountability framework, including the biennial submission by all Parties of greenhouse gas
inventories and the information necessary to track their progress, a technical expert review, a facilitative, multilateral consideration of
Parties' progress and mechanism to facilitate implementation of and promote compliance;
provides an ambitious solidarity package with adequate provisions on climate finance and on addressing needs linked to adaptation
and loss and damage associated with adverse effects of climate change;
encourages greater cooperation among Parties to share scientific knowledge on adaptation as well as information on practices and
policies.
The Paris Agreement will enter into force on the 30th day after the date on which at least 55 parties to the Convention accounting in total for at
least 55% of global greenhouse gas emissions have deposited their instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession to the UN.
As of 29 June 2016, 178 States had signed the Paris Agreement, and 19 States had deposited instruments for its ratification, accounting in
total for 0.18 % of the total global greenhouse gas emissions.
In the short justification which accompanies the recommendation, it is stressed that the Paris Agreement is a historically significant landmark
achievement for combating climate change and for multilateralism. It represents an ambitious, balanced, equitable and legally binding
agreement which marks a decisive turning point towards comprehensive and collective global action, and, when implemented, will definitively
and irreversibly accelerate the transition to a climate resilient, climate neutral global economy.
The rapporteur considered that the ratification decision on the conclusion of the Paris Agreement adopted under the UNFCCC will send a
strong signal and highlight the leadership of the EU and its Member States and their continuing efforts to address climate change at
international level.
It called on the Council to take all necessary steps to finalise its position on the Paris Agreement ratification, together with the parallel national
ratification processes in the Member States, as soon as possible, so as to finalise the EU ratification process and deposit the instruments of
ratification to the UN before the end of 2016.

2016/0184(NLE) - 04/10/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 610 votes to 38, with 31 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the draft Council decision on the
conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Paris Agreement adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC).
In line with the recommendation made its Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, Parliament gave its consent to
conclusion of the Paris Agreement adopted on 12 December 2015 at the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties (COP21).

2016/0184(NLE) - 05/10/2016 Final act
PURPOSE: to approve the conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Paris Agreement adopted under the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Council Decision (EU) 2016/1841 on the conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Paris Agreement
adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
CONTENT: the Council adopted a decision approving, on behalf of the Union, the Paris Agreement adopted on 12 December 2015 under the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as well as the Declaration of Competence on behalf of the Union.
The Paris Agreement, inter alia, sets out a long-term goal in line with the objective to keep the global temperature increase well below 2 °C
above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to keep it to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels. In order to achieve this goal, the Parties will
prepare, communicate and maintain successive nationally determined contributions.
Under the Paris Agreement, as of 2023, the Parties are to undertake a global stocktake every five years , based on the latest science and
implementation to date, which will track progress and consider emission reductions, adaptation and support provided, and each Party's
successive contribution is to represent a progression beyond its then current contribution and reflect its highest ambition.
Parties to the UNFCCC include the Union and its Member States. In its conclusions of 18 March 2016, the European Council underlined the
need for the Union and its Member States to conclude the Paris Agreement as soon as possible and on time in order to be parties as of its
entry into force.
It is a key Union priority to establish a resilient Energy Union to provide secure, sustainable, competitive and affordable energy to its citizens.
Achieving this requires continuation of ambitious climate action and progress on other aspects of the Energy Union.
The Paris Agreement replaces the approach taken under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol.
It will enter into force on the 30th day after the date on which at least 55 Parties to the UNFCCC accounting in total for at least an estimated 55
% of total greenhouse gas emissions, have deposited their instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession.
The joint action by the Union and its Member States will be agreed in due course and will cover the respective emission level allocated to the
Union and its Member States.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 6.10.2016.
