2016/2192(DEC) - 11/07/2016 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: presentation by the Commission of the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2015, as part of
the 2015 discharge procedure.
Analysis of the accounts of the European Asylum Support Office (EASO).
CONTENT: the organisational governance of the EU consists of institutions, agencies and other EU bodies whose expenditure is included in
the general budget of the Union.
The EU's operational expenditure of these institutions takes different forms, depending on how the money is paid out and managed.
From 2014 onwards, the Commission classifies its expenditure as follows:
Direct management: the budget is implemented directly by the Commission services.
Indirect management: the Commission confers tasks of implementation of the budget to bodies of EU law or national law, such as the
EU agencies.
Shared management: under this method of budget implementation tasks are delegated to Member States. About 80 % of the
expenditure falls under this management mode covering such areas as agricultural spending and structural actions.
This Commission document concerns the EU's consolidated accounts for the year 2015 and details how spending by the EU institutions and
bodies was carried out. The consolidated annual accounts of the EU provide financial information on the activities of the institutions, agencies
and other bodies of the EU from an accrual accounting and budgetary perspective.
It is the responsibility of the Commission's Accounting Officer to prepare the EU's consolidated annual accounts and ensure that they present
fairly, in all material aspects, the financial position, the result of the operations and the cash flows of the EU institutions and bodies, including
the European Asylum Support Office (EASO), with a view to granting discharge.

Discharge procedure: the final step of a budget lifecycle is the discharge of the budget for a given financial year. It represents the political
aspect of the external control of budget implementation and is the decision by which the European Parliament, acting on a Council
recommendation, "releases" the Commission (and other EU bodies) from its responsibility for management of a given budget by marking the
end of that budget's existence. The European Parliament is the discharge authority within the EU.
The discharge procedure may produce three outcomes: (i) the granting; (ii) postponement or; (iii) the refusal of the discharge.
The final discharge report including specific recommendations to the Commission for action is adopted in plenary by the European Parliament
and are subject to an annual follow up report in which the Commission outlines the concrete actions it has taken to implement the
recommendations made.
Each agency is subject to its own discharge procedure, including the EASO.
The European Asylum Support Office (EASO): the Office was set up under Regulation 439/2010 of the European Parliament and of the
Council. Its main aim is to help to improve the implementation of the Common European Asylum System (the CEAS).
As regards the Offices accounts, these are presented in detail in the document on the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for
2015:
Commitment appropriations:
-

committed: EUR 17 million;

-

paid: EUR 16 million;

-

carried-over: EUR 1 million.

Payment appropriations:
-

committed: EUR 18 million;

-

paid: EUR 13 million.

-

carried-over: EUR 2 million.

For further details on expenditure, please refer to the final accounts of the EASO.

2016/2192(DEC) - 13/09/2016 Court of Auditors: opinion, report
PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) for the
year 2015, together with the Offices reply.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit focused on the annual accounts of the European Asylum Support Office (EASO). As a reminder, its task is to support the
development of the Common European Asylum System. It was established with the aim of enhancing practical cooperation on asylum matters
and helping Member States fulfil their European and international obligations to give protection to people in need. EASO acts as a centre of
expertise on asylum. It also provides support to Member States whose asylum and reception systems are under particular pressure.
Statement of Assurance: pursuant to the provisions of Article 287 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the Court
has audited:
the annual accounts of the Foundation, which comprise the financial statements and the reports on the implementation of the budget
for the financial year ended 31 December 2015;
the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying those accounts.
Opinion on the reliability of the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the Offices annual accounts present fairly, in all material respects, its financial
position as at 31 December 2015 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions
of its Financial Regulation and the accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
Opinion on the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the accounts: the Court considers that the transactions underlying the
annual accounts for the year ended 31 December 2015 are legal and regular in all material respects.
The report also made a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of the Office, accompanied by the latters response.
The main observations may be summarised as follows:
The Courts observations:
budgetary management: the Court noted that the Office committed only EUR 14.5 million, i.e. 93.7 % of the approved budget. The
level of committed appropriations carried over for administrative expenditure was high at more than EUR 1 million. The carry-overs
mainly relate to consulting services for ICT developments contracted in the last quarter of 2015 (EUR 0.4 million) and investments in
IT infrastructure (EUR 0.3 million) in view of the expected recruitment of additional staff following the decision of the budget authority
at the end of 2015 to increase the establishment plan.
The Offices replies:
budgetary management: the EASO stated that the carry overs were planned in advance and well justified, due to EASOs role in the
migration crisis, in consideration of which the Budget Authority significantly increased EASO budget and staff for 2016. As a

consequence, at the very end of 2015, EASO had to get ready to accommodate extra staff (+ 30 Temporary Agents) by procuring
necessary goods and services.
Lastly, the Court of Auditors report contains a summary of the Offices key figures in 2015:
Budget: EUR 15.9 million.
Staff: 93 including officials, temporary and contract staff and seconded national experts.

2016/2192(DEC) - 07/02/2017 Supplementary non-legislative basic document
Having examined the revenue and expenditure accounts for the financial year 2015 and the balance sheet as at 31 December 2015 of the
European Asylum Support Office (EASO), as well as the Court of Auditors' report on the annual accounts of the Office for the financial year
2015, accompanied by the Office's replies to the Court's observations, the Council recommended the European Parliament to give a discharge
to the Executive Director of the Office in respect of the implementation of the budget for the financial year 2015.
The Council welcomed the Court's opinion that, in all material respects, the Office's annual accounts present fairly its financial position as at 31
December 2015 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions of the Office's
Financial Regulation, and that the underlying transactions for 2015 are legal and regular in all material respects.
Nevertheless, the Council made some observations as follows:
carry-overs: the Council noted that a high level of commitment appropriations was carried over to 2016. It encouraged the Office to
continue improving its financial programming and monitoring of the budget implementation, in order to reduce the level of
commitments carried over to the following financial year to the minimum strictly necessary;
reimbursements: the Council invited the Office to continue improving its internal procedures in relation to the reimbursement of travel
and daily subsistence costs;
recruitment: the Council welcomed the Office's new recruitment policy aimed at ensuring that its recruitment procedures become more
transparent.

2016/2192(DEC) - 28/03/2017 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Inés AYALA SENDER (S&D, ES) on discharge in respect of the implementation of
the budget of the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) for the financial year 2015.
The committee called on the European Parliament to grant the Executive Director of the Office discharge in respect of the implementation of
the agencys budget for the financial year 2015.
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it had obtained reasonable assurance that the annual accounts of the Office for the financial year
2015 were reliable and that the underlying transactions were legal and regular, Members called on Parliament to approve the closure of the
Offices accounts. They made, however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is granted, in
addition to the general recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies
:
EASOs financial statements: Members noted that the final budget of the EASO for the financial year 2015 was EUR 15 944 846 of
which 94 % derives from the Union budget.
Budget and financial management: Members noted with concern that in 2015 the Office made 1 024 payments after the time limits set
out in the Financial Regulation, representing an increase of 0.6 % compared to 2014. They welcomed measures put in place to reduce
late payments.
Members also made a series of observations regarding commitments, carry-overs, procurement, recruitment procedures, the prevention and
management of conflicts of interests and internal audits.
Lastly, Members recognised that the growth of the Offices budget in 2016 was significant in order to cope with additional tasks relating to the
European Agenda on Migration, the hotspots approach, decisions of the EU Leaders Summit on Western Balkans and the EU-Turkey
statement. They noted with satisfaction that a range of steps were taken by the Office to deal with such an unprecedented increase in tasks
and recalled that in 2015 a record number of almost 1.4 million applications for international protection were made .

2016/2192(DEC) - 27/04/2017 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament decided to grant the Executive Director of the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) discharge in respect of the
implementation of Authoritys budget for the financial year 2015.
The vote on the decision on discharge covers the closure of the accounts (in accordance with Annex IV, Article 5 (1) (a) to Parliaments Rules
of Procedure).
Noting that the Court of Auditors has stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the Offices annual accounts for the financial year
2015 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Parliament adopted by 515 votes to 113 with 4 abstentions, a
resolution containing a series of recommendations, which form an integral part of the decision on discharge and which add to the general
recommendations set out in the resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies.
These recommendations may be summarised as follows:
EASOs financial statements: Parliament noted that the final budget of the EASO for the financial year 2015 was EUR 15 944 846 of
which 94 % derives from the Union budget.

Budget and financial management: it noted with concern that in 2015 the Office made 1 024 payments after the time limits set out in
the Financial Regulation, representing an increase of 0.6 % compared to 2014. It welcomed measures put in place to reduce late
payments.
Parliament also made a series of observations regarding commitments, carry-overs, procurement, recruitment procedures, the prevention and
management of conflicts of interests and internal audits.
On performance, it noted that the Office developed further measures to assist Member States in need of special support in their asylum and
reception systems and that it provided this special support to Cyprus, Bulgaria, Greece and Italy. Moreover, it noted that in 2015 the Office
further developed its activities to support Member States whose asylum and reception systems are subject to particular pressure, in particular
by providing support to Greece and Italy and by strengthening the Offices capacity to respond in a timely and effective manner to emergency
situations.
Lastly, Parliament recognised that the growth of the Offices budget in 2016 was significant in order to cope with additional tasks relating to the
European Agenda on Migration, the hotspots approach, decisions of the EU Leaders Summit on Western Balkans and the EU-Turkey
statement. It noted with satisfaction that a range of steps were taken by the Office to deal with such an unprecedented increase in tasks and
recalled that in 2015 a record number of almost 1.4 million applications for international protection were made .
