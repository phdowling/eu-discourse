Summary

The European Parliament adopted a resolution on the systematic mass murder of religious minorities by the so-called ISIS/Daesh.
The text adopted in plenary was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ALDE, ECR, ALDE, Greens/EFA and EFDD groups.
Parliament recalled its strong condemnation of the so-called ISIS/Daesh and its egregious human rights abuses, which amount to crimes
against humanity and war crimes, within the meaning of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC).
War crimes and genocide: stressing that the so-called ISIS/Daesh have committed genocide crimes against Christians, Yazidis and religious
and ethnic minorities who do not agree with their interpretation of Islam, Parliament urged each of the Contracting Parties to the UN
Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, signed at Paris on 9 December 1948, and to other relevant
international agreements, in particular the EU Member States, to prevent war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide within their
territory. In this regard, it urged Syria and Iraq to accept the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court.
Parliament called that UN Security Council Resolution 2253 (2015) imposed a legal duty on UN member states to prohibit any kind of
assistance to the so-called ISIS/Daesh and other terrorist organisations, notably supplying arms and financial assistance, including the illegal
oil trade, and urges them to make this kind of assistance a crime under domestic law.
Destruction of religious and cultural sites and artefacts: Parliament denounced in the strongest terms the destruction of religious and cultural
sites and artefacts by the so-called ISIS/Daesh, which constitutes an attack against the cultural heritage of all inhabitants of Syria and Iraq and
of humanity at large. It called on all states to step up their criminal investigations and judicial cooperation with a view to identifying all groups
responsible for illicit trafficking in cultural goods and for damaging or destroying cultural heritage that belongs to all of humanity in Syria, Iraq
and the broader Middle East and North African regions.
Fighting radicalisation: the resolution urged all the countries of the international community, including the EU Member States, to work actively
on fighting radicalisation and to improve their legal and jurisdictional systems in order to avoid their nationals and citizens being able to travel
to join the so-called ISIS/Daesh, and to ensure that, should they do so, they are criminally prosecuted as soon as possible, including for online
incitement and support to commit those crimes.
Religious freedom: Parliament demanded respect by all for the inalienable right of all ethnic and religious minorities, and others, living in Iraq
and Syria, to continue to live in their historical and traditional homelands in dignity, equality and safety, and to fully practise their religion and
beliefs freely without being subject to any kind of coercion, violence or discrimination. Members called for the EU to establish a permanent
Special Representative for Freedom of Religion and Belief.
Military and humanitarian assistance: recognising that the ongoing persecution of religious and ethnic groups in the Middle East is a factor that
contributes to mass migration and internal displacement, Parliament requested the international community and its Member States, including
the EU and its Member States, to ensure the necessary security conditions and prospects for all those who have been forced to leave their
homeland or have been forcibly displaced. It stressed the importance of the international community providing protection and aid, including
military protection and aid, in accordance with international law, to all those targeted by the so-called ISIS/Daesh and other terrorist
organisations in the Middle East.
Members considered that safe havens, protected by UN-mandated forces, could be part of the answer to the massive challenge of providing
temporary protection for millions of refugees from the conflict in Syria and Iraq.
Peace negotiations: Parliament reaffirmed its full and active support for international diplomatic efforts and the work of UN Special Envoy
Staffan de Mistura aimed at launching peace negotiations in Geneva between all Syrian parties, with the participation of all the relevant global
and regional players, in the coming days, as well as his proposals for local ceasefires. It called for the EU and the international community to
put pressure on all donors to fulfil their promises and to fully commit themselves to providing financial support for the host countries, especially
ahead of the Syria donors conference in London on 4 February 2016.
