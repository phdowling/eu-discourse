Summary

2016/0808(CNS) - 20/05/2016 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to approve the conclusion by the European Police Office (Europol) of the Agreement on Strategic Cooperation between the
Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China and Europol.
PROPOSED ACT: Council implementing decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to
follow its opinion.
BACKGROUND: pursuant to Decision 2009/371/JHA and Decision 2009/934/JHA, Europol is to conclude agreements with the third States
which have been put on the list determined by Decision 2009/935/JHA. Such agreements have the objective of supporting and strengthening
action by the competent authorities of the Member States and their mutual cooperation in preventing and combating organised crime, terrorism
and other forms of serious crime affecting two or more Member States, and may concern the exchange of operational, strategic or technical
information, including personal data and classified information.
Strategic agreements involve the exchange of information excluding personal data, whereas operational agreements involve the exchange of
information including personal data.
Strategic agreements may be concluded by Europol only after approval by the Council, the latter having previously consulted the Management
Board of Europol ('Management Board'). Operational agreements require, in addition, that the Council obtain, via the Management Board, the
opinion of the Joint Supervisory Body of Europol, as far as the agreement concerns the exchange of personal data.
China is included in the list determined by Decision 2009/935/JHA.
In order to increase effectiveness in preventing and combating serious forms of crime, Europol has initiated, in accordance with Decision
2009/934/JHA, the procedure for the conclusion of an Agreement on Strategic Cooperation between the Ministry of Public Security of the
People's Republic of China and Europol ('Strategic Agreement').
The terms of the cooperation governed by the Strategic Agreement provide for: the exchange of information, which may, in accordance with
the tasks of Europol as outlined in Decision 2009/371/JHA, include:
specialist knowledge,
general situation reports,
results of strategic analysis,
information on criminal investigation procedures and information on crime-prevention methods,
participation in training activities,
the provision of advice and support in individual criminal investigations.
The Strategic Agreement contains no provision relating to the exchange of personal data.
The Management Board approved the Strategic Agreement on 8 April 2016.
The conditions for triggering the exercise of implementing powers by the Council pursuant to Decisions 2009/371/JHA, 2009/934/JHA and
2009/935/JHA have been met and an implementing decision should therefore be adopted in order to approve the conclusion of the Strategic
Agreement.
This is the aim of this proposal.
CONTENT: under this proposal, it is provided that the Council adopt an implementing decision by which Europol is authorised to approve the
Agreement on Strategic Cooperation between the Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China and Europol.
Territorial provisions: Denmark is bound by Decision 2009/371/JHA and is therefore taking part in the adoption and application of this Decision
which implements Decision 2009/371/JHA.
The United Kingdom and Ireland are bound by Decision 2009/371/JHA and are therefore taking part in the adoption and application of this
Decision which implements Decision 2009/371/JHA.

2016/0808(CNS) - 28/09/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading

The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs adopted the report by Claude MORAES (S&D, UK) on the draft Council
implementing decision approving the conclusion by the European Police Office (Europol) of the Agreement on Strategic Cooperation between
the Ministry of Public Security of China and Europol.
The committee recommended the European Parliament to approve the Council draft.
Members called on the Commission to assess the provisions contained in the cooperation agreement, after the date of application of the new
Europol Regulation. They also called on Commission to inform Parliament and the Council of the outcome of this assessment.
The explanatory memorandum accompanying the report stressed that there seems to be clear operational needs for Europol to cooperate with
China.
According to Europol, China is increasingly relevant as a source-, destination- and transit-country in the fight against organized crime, such as
facilitated illegal immigration, trafficking in human beings, drug related crimes, euro-counterfeiting, Intellectual Property Rights infringements,
sport corruption, as well as cybercrime and money laundering related activities. Furthermore, China is home to several high-impact organised
criminal groups.
Against this backdrop, the rapporteur supported the conclusion of this strategic cooperation agreement with China, since it would aid and
reinforce the fight against organised crime and would contribute to enhancing international law enforcement co-operation.

2016/0808(CNS) - 04/10/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 460 votes to 126, with 90 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the draft Council implementing decision
approving the conclusion by the European Police Office (Europol) of the Agreement on Strategic Cooperation between the Ministry of Public
Security of China and Europol.
In line with the recommendation made by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, Parliament approved the Council draft.
Member also called on the Commission to:
assess, after the date of application of the new Europol Regulation, the provisions contained in the cooperation agreement;
inform Parliament and the Council of the outcome of this assessment and, if appropriate, to submit a recommendation for an
authorisation to open the international renegotiation of the agreement.
