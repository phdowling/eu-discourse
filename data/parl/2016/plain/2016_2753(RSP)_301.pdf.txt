Summary

2016/2753(RSP) - 09/06/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a resolution on Cambodia.
The text adopted in plenary was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ECR, ALDE, GUE/NGL, Greens/EFA and EFDD groups.
Parliament expressed its deep concerns about the worsening climate for opposition politicians and human rights activists in Cambodia. It
condemned all acts of violence, politically motivated charges, arbitrary detention, and deplored the escalation of politically motivated charges,
judicial harassment, and in particular the politically motivated charges, sentences and convictions relating to the legitimate work of activists,
political critics and human rights defenders in Cambodia.
Members urged the Cambodian authorities to revoke the arrest warrant for, and drop all charges against, opposition leader Sam Rainsy and
CNRP members of the National Assembly and Senate. They called for the immediate release of the five human rights defenders still in
preventive custody.
The Cambodian authorities are urged to:
drop all politically motivated charges and other criminal proceedings against ADHOC and other Cambodian human rights defenders,;
cease all threats to apply repressive Laws on Associations and NGOs provisions, together with all other attempts to intimidate and
harass human rights defenders and national and international organisations;
release immediately and unconditionally all those jailed on politically motivated and trumped-up charges;
strengthen democracy and the rule of law in the country;
ensure the security of all democratically elected representatives of Cambodia, irrespective of their political affiliation;
ensure full and impartial investigations with the participation of the UN, leading to the prosecution of all those responsible for the
recent brutal attack on the two CNRP members of the National Assembly by members of the armed forces;
drop all charges against former trade union leader and NEC member Rong Chhun;
to repeal the Trade Union Law, the Law on Associations and NGOs (LANGO) and similar laws which are restricting fundamental
freedoms;
cease all forced evictions and land grabbing and to ensure that any evictions are conducted in full accordance with international
standards.
Parliament called on the Member States, the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and
Security Policy, the European External Action Service (EEAS) and the Commission to set out clear benchmarks for the forthcoming elections
in Cambodia, consistent with international law on freedom of expression.
Lastly, it called the National Election Committee to ensure that all eligible voters, including migrant workers and detainees, have access to, and
time to take advantage of, registration opportunities.
