2016/0058(NLE) - 03/03/2016 Initial legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude an Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Union and the Eastern Republic of
Uruguay pursuant to Article XXIV:6 and Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994 relating to the modification
of concessions in the schedule of the Republic of Croatia in the course of its accession to the European Union.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: with the accession of Croatia, the European Union enlarged its customs union. Consequently, the European Union was
required under World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules (Article XXIV:6 of the GATT 1994) to enter into negotiations with WTO Members having

negotiating rights related to the tariff schedule of Croatia in order to eventually agree on a compensatory adjustment.
On 15 July 2013, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations under Article XXIV:6 of the GATT 1994. The Commission has
negotiated with the Members of the WTO holding negotiating rights with respect to the withdrawal of specific concessions in relation to the
withdrawal of the schedule of the Republic of Croatia in the course of its accession to the European Union.
The Council (Trade Policy Committee) has been regularly consulted on the content and advancement of the negotiations. The European
Parliament (INTA Committee) has been informed.
Negotiations with the Eastern Republic of Uruguay resulted in a draft Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters that was initialled on 18
December 2015 in Nairobi (the Agreement).
CONTENT: this proposal asks the Council to adopt a decision to conclude the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters with the
Uruguay. In parallel, a separate proposal on the signature of this Agreement is also submitted.
As a result of the Agreement, the Commission will adopt an implementing Regulation to extend the following tariff rate quotas, pursuant to
Article 187(a) of the Single Common Market Organisation (CMO) Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013):
add 76 tonnes in the country allocated (Uruguay) EU tariff rate quota 'boneless meat of bovine animals, fresh or chilled; edible offal of
bovine animals, thick skirt and thin skirt, fresh or chilled', tariff item numbers ex 0201 30 00 and ex 0206 10 95, maintaining the
present in-quota rate of 20%. The new tariff rate quota shall be 4 076 tonnes;
add 1 875 tonnes into the EU tariff rate quota 'Meat of bovine animals, frozen ? Edible offal of bovine animals, frozen' , tariff item
numbers 0202 and 0206.29.91, maintaining the present in-quota rate of 20%. The new tariff rate quota shall be 54 875 tonnes.
The relevant implementation measures are being prepared in parallel to this proposal.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the budgetary impact shall be exclusively limited to the revenue side. The amounts are estimated at EUR 1.3
million per year.
The method used for calculation of revenues: unit value of average similar trade imports for years 2012-2014 multiplied by the new tariff rate
quotas volumes multiplied by the in-quota rate duty (20%) minus 25% deduction for collection costs. For subsequent years, the unit value has
been considered as constant.

2016/0058(NLE) - 30/03/2016 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude an Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Union and the Eastern Republic of
Uruguay pursuant to Article XXIV:6 and Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994 relating to the modification
of concessions in the schedule of the Republic of Croatia in the course of its accession to the European Union.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: with the accession of Croatia, the EU enlarged its customs union. Consequently, it was required under World Trade
Organisation (WTO) rules (Article XXIV:6 of the GATT 1994) to enter into negotiations with WTO Members having negotiating rights related to
the tariff schedule of Croatia in order to eventually agree on a compensatory adjustment.
Such adjustment is due if the adoption of the EUs external tariff regime results in an increase in tariff beyond the level for which the acceding
country has bound itself at the WTO.
On 15 July 2013, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations under Article XXIV:6 of the GATT 1994.
The Commission has negotiated with the Members of the WTO holding negotiating rights with respect to the withdrawal of specific
concessions in relation to the withdrawal of the schedule of Croatia in the course of its accession to the European Union.
Negotiations with Uruguay resulted in a draft Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters that was initialled on 18 December 2015 in
Nairobi.
Consequently, this proposal asks the Council to adopt a decision to conclude the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters with
Uruguay.
In parallel, a separate proposal on the signature of this Agreement is also submitted.
It is now necessary to approve the Agreement on behalf of the EU.
CONTENT: the Council is called upon to adopt a decision to approve, on behalf of the European Union, the Agreement in the form of an
Exchange of Letters between the EU and Uruguay pursuant to Article XXIV:6 and Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (GATT) 1994 relating to the modification of concessions in the schedule of the Republic of Croatia in the course of its accession to the
EU.
The text of the Agreement is attached to this decision.
Implementing regulation: as a result of the Agreement the Commission will adopt an implementing Regulation to extend the following tariff rate
quotas, pursuant to Article 187(a) of the Single Common Market Organisation (CMO) Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013):
add 76 tonnes in the country allocated (Uruguay) EU tariff rate quota 'boneless meat of bovine animals, fresh or chilled; edible offal of

numbers 0202 and 0206.29.91, maintaining the present in-quota rate of 20%. The new tariff rate quota shall be 54 875 tonnes.

BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this proposal has no impact on expenditure. However, it has an impact on revenue (EUR 1.3 million/year).

2016/0058(NLE) - 19/07/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on International Trade adopted the report by Pablo ZALBA BIDEGAIN (EPP, ES) on the draft Council decision on the
conclusion of the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Union and the Eastern Republic of Uruguay
pursuant to Article XXIV:6 and Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994 relating to the modification of
concessions in the schedule of the Republic of Croatia in the course of its accession to the European Union.
The committee recommended the European Parliament to give its consent to the conclusion of the Agreement.
With the accession of the Republic of Croatia, the EU enlarged its customs union and was therefore required under WTO rules (Article XXIV:6
of the GATT 1994) to enter into negotiations with Uruguay regarding the tariff schedule of Croatia in order to eventually agree on a
compensatory adjustment as the EU's external tariff regime results in an increase of tariffs.
Recalling that the negotiations with Uruguay resulted in a draft Agreement initialled on 18 December 2015 in Nairobi, Members stated that the
EU will incorporate in its schedule for the customs territory of the EU 28 that of the EU 27 with modifications related to tariff rate quotas on
bovine meat.
Against this background, the European Parliament's consent to this Council Decision is a mandatory component in the completion of the
ratification process of the Additional Protocol.

2016/0058(NLE) - 13/09/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading

concessions in the schedule of the Republic of Croatia in the course of its accession to the European Union.
The European Parliament gave its consent to the conclusion of the Agreement.
