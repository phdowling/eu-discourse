Initial legislative proposal

2016/0366(NLE) - 28/11/2016 Initial legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude the Framework Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and New Zealand, of
the other part.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has approved the latter.
BACKGROUND: on 25 June 2012, the Council adopted a decision authorising the Commission and the High Representative of the Union for
Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to negotiate a Framework Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part,
and New Zealand, of the other part. Negotiations began in July 2012 and the Agreement was signed on 5 October 2016. Pending its entry into
force, certain parts of the Agreement, as mutually determined by the EU and New Zealand, are provisionally applied.
The Agreement will contribute significantly to the improvement of the partnership between the EU and New Zealand, a partnership which is
based on common values and principles, including respect for democratic principles, human rights and fundamental freedoms, the rule of law,
international peace and security. The Agreement is premised on respect for human rights and democratic principles, and for international law
and the principles set out in the Charter of the United Nations, which constitute the basis for cooperation between the Parties.
Note on legal basis: the Agreement pursues objectives and has components in the areas of the common foreign and security policy, the
common commercial policy and development cooperation. These aspects of the agreement are inseparably linked without one being incidental
to the other.
Article 218(6)(a)(iii) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provides that, where an agreement establishes a specific
institutional framework by organising cooperation procedures, the Council must adopt a decision concluding the agreement after obtaining the
consent of the European Parliament. Moreover, the second subparagraph of Article 218(8) of the TFEU provides that the Council must act
unanimously when the agreement covers a field for which unanimity is required for the adoption of a Union act. The common foreign and
security policy is a field for which unanimity is required for the adoption of a Union act. Equally, the Agreement establishes an institutional
framework by organising cooperation procedures between the EU and its Member States, of the one part, and New Zealand, of the other part.
Accordingly, the legal basis of the proposed decision should therefore be Article 37 of the Treaty of the European Union (TEU), Article 207
TFEU and Article 212(1) TFEU read in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) TFEU and the second subparagraph of Article 218(8) TFEU. No
additional provisions are required as legal basis
CONTENT : the Commission and of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy jointly propose that the
Council adopt a decision approving the Framework Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and New

Zealand, of the other part, on behalf of the Union.
The text of the Agreement is attached to the Decision.
The purpose of the Agreement is ?to establish a strengthened partnership between the Parties and to deepen and enhance cooperation on
issues of mutual interest, reflecting shared values and common principles, including through intensifying high-level dialogue.?
The content of the Agreement covers three pillars:
- political cooperation on foreign policy and security issues of common interest, including weapons of mass destruction (WMD), small arms and
light weapons (SALW), counter-terrorism, promoting international peace and security and cooperation in multilateral fora. The Agreement
includes binding political clauses based on the shared values. These clauses are in line with the standard clauses found in similar agreements
signed by the EU;
- cooperation on economic and trade matters, including economic policy dialogue, promoting trade and investment matters, and sectoral
economic and trade issues, such as :
agriculture,
technical barriers to trade,
sanitary and phytosanitary issues,
government procurement and intellectual property.
- sectoral cooperation, including in the areas of:
research and innovation,
education and culture,
migration,
counterterrorism,
the fight against organised crime and cybercrime and
judicial cooperation.
- Institutional framework: the Agreement establishes a Joint Committee, the objective of which is to monitor the development of the bilateral
relationship between the Parties.
Suspension mechanism: the Agreement includes a suspension mechanism. In cases of particularly serious and substantial violation of the
essential elements of the Agreement, the Agreement may be suspended or terminated, and other appropriate measures affecting other
agreements may be taken in accordance with the rights and obligations of the Parties under such agreements. Once in force, the Agreement
will create a coherent, legally binding overall framework for the EU?s relations with New Zealand.
