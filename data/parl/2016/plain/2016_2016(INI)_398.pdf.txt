2016/2016(INI) - 31/03/2017 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Fisheries adopted an own-initiative report by Ulrike RODUST (S&D, DE) on the management of the fishing fleets in the
Outermost Regions (ORs).
As a reminder, the outermost regions include nine EU regions, which are part of France (Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Réunion, Martinique,
Mayotte and Saint-Martin), Portugal (Madeira and Azores) and Spain (Canary Islands).
Specificities of the ORs: Members considered that the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund
(EMFF), designed to tackle the problems and challenges of continental Europe, can only provide a limited response to the specific
characteristics of fisheries in the ORs. They called, therefore, for the development of a strategy for each regional sea basin tailored to the
specific situation of each of the outermost regions.
Stressing the presence in the ORs of a wide variety of small communities that are highly dependent on traditional, coastal and small-scale
fishing, the report called for the need to:
involve local fisheries in achieving food security for local communities;
protect marine biological resources around the ORs;
strengthen support for relevant scientific research projects given that the OR seabed is a veritable living laboratory of biodiversity;
maintain the balance between fishing capacity and opportunities in accordance with the precautionary principle and taking into
account socio-economic realities.
Members observed the difficulty, or even impossibility, for certain fishermen in the ORs to access credit and/or insurance for their vessels,
causing safety problems and economic constraints for these fishermen.
Making better use of possibilities provided under Article 349 of the Treaty and the CFP: Article 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the
European Union comprises the specific features of ORs. These include remoteness, insularity, small size, difficult topography and climate, and
economic dependence on a few products.
Members called for the full application of Article 349 TFEU in the European Union's policies, regulations, funds and programmes relating to
fisheries, particularly in the EMFF, in order to respond to the specific difficulties encountered by the ORs.
The report recommended, inter alia:

setting up a separate Advisory Council for the ORs;
better use of the possibilities provided for in the EMFF to support this kind of local development in the ORs;
establishing fisheries local action groups (FLAGs), which are recognised to be an important channel for support and for opportunities
to diversify fishing activities;
stepping up the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing undertaken in the EEZ of certain ORs;
speeding up the implementation of the EMFF and to use the opportunities it provides to invest heavily in fleet modernisation
improvements to safety, on-board hygiene, energy efficiency and quality of fishery products as well as in fishing ports, landing sites
and aquaculture, in order to generate new market outlets;
paying particular attention to the interests of ORs when fisheries agreements are concluded with third countries;
continue with specific aid schemes such as special taxation models;
improving data collection on stocks and the assessment of the impact of small-scale vessels in the ORs;
providing support to aquaculture development projects;
that the aid intensity for engine replacement in the ORs should be increased where scientific evidence indicates that climate conditions
and climate change have a decisive negative impact on the ORs fleets.
The Commission is invited to look into the possibility of establishing an instrument specifically dedicated to supporting fisheries in the ORs,
along the lines of the POSEI scheme for agriculture in the ORs.

2016/2016(INI) - 27/04/2017 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 428 votes to 64, with 118 abstentions, a resolution on the management of the fishing fleets in the
Outermost Regions (ORs).
As a reminder, the outermost regions include nine EU regions, which are part of France (Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Réunion, Martinique,
Mayotte and Saint-Martin), Portugal (Madeira and Azores) and Spain (Canary Islands).
Specificities of the ORs: Members considered that the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund
(EMFF), designed to tackle the problems and challenges of continental Europe, can only provide a limited response to the specific
characteristics of fisheries in the ORs. They called, therefore, for the development of a strategy for each regional sea basin tailored to the
specific situation of each of the outermost regions.
Stressing the presence in the ORs of a wide variety of small communities that are highly dependent on traditional, coastal and small-scale
fishing, the resolution called for the need to:
involve local fisheries in achieving food security for local communities;
protect marine biological resources around the ORs: only fishing vessels registered in OR ports should be allowed to fish in OR
waters;
strengthen support for relevant scientific research projects given that the OR seabed is a veritable living laboratory of biodiversity;
maintain the balance between fishing capacity and opportunities in accordance with the precautionary principle and taking into
account socio-economic realities.
Members observed the difficulty, or even impossibility, for certain fishermen in the ORs to access credit and/or insurance for their vessels,
causing safety problems and economic constraints for these fishermen.

paying particular attention to the interests of ORs when fisheries agreements are concluded with third countries;
continue with specific aid schemes such as special taxation models;
improving data collection on stocks and the assessment of the impact of small-scale vessels in the ORs;
allowing the funding (at EU or national level) of the ORs artisanal and traditional fishing vessels with a view to developing economic
opportunities for all players in the blue economy;
that the aid intensity for engine replacement in the ORs should be increased where scientific evidence indicates that climate conditions
and climate change have a decisive negative impact on the ORs fleets;
creating better incentives under a future EMFF to encourage young people to work in the maritime economy.
The Commission is invited to look into the possibility of establishing an instrument specifically dedicated to supporting fisheries in the ORs,
along the lines of the POSEI scheme for agriculture in the ORs.
