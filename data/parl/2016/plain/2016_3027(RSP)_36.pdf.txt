Summary

2016/3027(RSP) - 15/12/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a resolution on the situation of the Rohingya minority in Myanmar.
The text adopted in plenary was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ECR, ALDE, GUE/NGL, Greens/EFA and EFDD groups.
Members recalled the violent clashes in northern Rakhine State and deplored the loss of lives, livelihoods and shelter and the reported
disproportionate use of force by the armed forces of Myanmar. They urged the military and security forces to stop immediately the killings,
harassment and rapes of the Rohingya people.
Although Members welcomed the announcement of the establishment of a Commission of Inquiry into the recent violence in Rakhine State,
they insisted that this only be the first step in a broader commitment to end impunity for crimes against the Rohingya minority.
They are particularly appalled at reports of sexual violence as a means of intimidation and a weapon of war in the suppression of the Rohingya
minority and demanded prosecution of the perpetrators of these crimes.
The Government of Myanmar is called upon to:
immediately allow humanitarian aid to reach all conflict areas;
immediately end the terrible discrimination and segregation of the Rohingya minority;
immediately start registering all children at birth;
lift all unnecessary, discriminatory and disproportional restrictions in Rakhine State;
combat trafficking of persons and transnational organised crime;
improve its cooperation with the UN, including the UNHCR;
condemn unequivocally all incitement to racial or religious hatred and hostilities against the Rohingya minority.
Parliament called on Sakharov Prize laureate, Aung San Suu Kyi, to use her key position in the Government of Myanmar to improve the
situation of the Rohingya minority.
Lastly, it called on the EU and its Member States to continue their support of the new democratic structures of Myanmar.
