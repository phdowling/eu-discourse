Commission response to text adopted in
plenary

2016/2053(INI) - 12/09/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Development adopted the own-initiative report by Norbert NEUSER (S&D, DE) on the future of ACP-EU relations beyond
2020.
Members recalled that the Partnership Agreement between the members of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States of the one part,
and the European Community and its Member States, of the other part, signed in June 2000 (the Cotonou Agreement), is based on a number
of unique characteristics: it is: (i) a legally binding document, with an unparalleled numerical strength of 79+28 member states, (ii)
comprehensive through its three pillars of development cooperation, political cooperation and economic and trade cooperation, and (iii)
comprised of a joint institutional framework, with a large budget in the form of the European Development Fund (EDF).
The report recalled the unique nature of ACP-EU cooperation and stressed the need to put in place a new structure that maintains those parts
of the ACP-EU acquis, e.g.:
a commitment to human rights and gender equality, human development, good governance and democracy;
the objective of the rule of law;
exchange of best practice in a common framework, while the main work must be carried out in accordance with the principle of
subsidiarity, that is, it must take place in regional agreements that are tailored to specific regional needs and to the mutual interests
existing between the EU and the region.
Members underlined that the common framework and the regional agreements should be legally binding.
Objectives, principles and terms of cooperation: the report states that the following must be placed at the centre of a new agreement:
the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and respect for internationally agreed aid effectiveness principles;
fight against, and ultimate eradication of, poverty and inequalities;
human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law.
Members called for an ACP-EU peer monitoring, accountability and review mechanism to scrutinise SDG implementation in member states on
a regular basis. They also called for stronger involvement in political dialogue, programming and implementation and support for capacity
building by civil society, especially for local groups that are directly concerned by policies.

The private sector could play a pivotal role in the development process and could contribute to financing development, provided investment
occurs with respect for the people, for traditional ownership or use, and for the environment. Private investment should be supported under the
auspices of the European Investment Bank (EIB).
Future ACP-EU institutions: the report stressed the following points:
joint ACP-EU Council meetings should include topical and urgent political debates, including on sensitive issues, with the aim of
adopting joint conclusions on them;
the new cooperation agreement should include a strong parliamentary dimension, through a Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA),
ensuring the adequate democratic and proportional representation and participation of all political forces in its debates;
the JPA should be aligned with the new regional structure, thus focusing its work in regional fora on issues of regional importance ,
strongly involving the national and regional parliaments;
further efforts should be made to improve JPA scrutiny of development programming, bearing in mind the development effectiveness
principles and follow-up to such scrutiny.
Future funding: Members were convinced that the simultaneous expiry of the Cotonou Agreement and of the Unions multiannual financial
framework (MFF) provides an opportunity to finally decide on the budgetisation of the European Development Fund. However, this
budgetisation should be conditioned by:
a guaranteed ring-fencing of developing funds to maintain the level of financing for developing countries, and
a permanent and separate solution for EU financing of security expenses that are linked to and in coherence with development
cooperation;
Members stressed that EU development aid principles must be applied on an equal basis to all developing countries, and that advanced ACP
countries must therefore graduate out of receiving EU development aid on the same terms as non-ACP countries. Furthermore, a higher
degree of self-financing by the ACP countries would be in line with the ACP ambitions to be an autonomous player, and the new agreement
should include enhanced tools for building ACP countries' capacity to fund vital economic sectors.
The report called for the introduction of a dedicated instrument for all overseas countries and territories (OCTs), which is in keeping with their
special status and their membership of the European family.
Trade dimension: Members reiterated that Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) constitute a basis for regional cooperation and that they
must be instruments for development and regional integration. They called for a post-Cotonou Agreement as a political umbrella agreement
under which binding minimum requirements for EPAs are set, in order to ensure continuity for EPA linkages in the existing Cotonou Agreement
to sustainability provisions on good governance, respect for human rights, including among the most vulnerable people, and respect for social
and environmental standards.

2016/2053(INI) - 04/10/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 489 votes to 146, with 37 abstentions, a resolution on the future of ACP-EU relations beyond 2020.
Valuable and unique achievement: recalling the strength and acquis of the Cotonou Agreement, Members affirmed that ACP-EU cooperation
is a valuable and unique achievement that has strengthened bonds between ACP and EU peoples and countries and their parliaments
throughout the last 40 years.
In light of the ACP countries demonstration of their commitment to taking joint action as a group, Parliament insisted that in order to improve
the effectiveness of cooperation and adapt it to new challenges, a new structure must be adopted that:
maintains those parts of the ACP-EU acquis that are universal in nature, such as a commitment to human rights and gender equality,
human development, good governance and democracy, the objective of the rule of law, and exchange of best practice in a common
framework;
provides that while the main work must be carried out in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, it must take place in regional
agreements that are tailored to specific regional needs and to the mutual interests existing between the EU and the respective region.
Both the common framework and the regional agreements should be legally binding and be designed in a way that takes into account existing
regional and sub-regional organisations, e.g. the African Union and the Regional Economic Communities.
Objectives, principles and terms of cooperation: Parliament stated that the following must be placed at the centre of a new agreement:
the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and respect for internationally agreed aid effectiveness principles;
fight against, and ultimate eradication of, poverty and inequalities;
human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law.
A new agreement must primarily be a political project based on the principle of ownership and clearly leave behind the donor-recipient
mentality. Cooperation should take place in areas of common interest where mutual gains can be expected, not just in economic terms but
also with regard to peace and security, human rights and the rule of law, good governance and democracy, migration, the environment,
climate change.
Members also called for:
an ACP-EU peer monitoring, accountability and review mechanism to scrutinise SDG implementation in Member States on a regular
basis;
stronger involvement in political dialogue, programming and implementation and support for capacity building by civil society,
especially for local groups that are directly concerned by policies; national parliaments and regional and local authorities, both in ACP
and EU countries, should participate more at all stages of ACP-EU policies and activities.
The private sector could play a pivotal role in the development process and could contribute to financing development, provided investment
occurs with respect for the people, for traditional ownership or use, and for the environment. Private investment should be supported under the

auspices of the European Investment Bank (EIB).
Future ACP-EU institutions: Parliament stressed the following points:
joint ACP-EU Council meetings should include topical and urgent political debates, including on sensitive issues, with the aim of
adopting joint conclusions on them;
the new cooperation agreement should include a strong parliamentary dimension, through a Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA),
ensuring the adequate democratic and proportional representation and participation of all political forces in its debates;
the JPA should be aligned with the new regional structure, thus focusing its work in regional fora on issues of regional importance ,
strongly involving the national and regional parliaments;
further efforts should be made to improve JPA scrutiny of development programming, bearing in mind the development effectiveness
principles and follow-up to such scrutiny.
Future funding: Parliament is convinced that the simultaneous expiry of the Cotonou Agreement and of the Unions multiannual financial
framework (MFF) provides an opportunity to finally decide on the budgetisation of the European Development Fund. However, this
budgetisation should be conditioned by:
a guaranteed ring-fencing of developing funds to maintain the level of financing for developing countries, and
a permanent and separate solution for EU financing of security expenses that are linked to and in coherence with development
cooperation.
Members stressed that EU development aid principles must be applied on an equal basis to all developing countries, and that advanced ACP
countries must therefore graduate out of receiving EU development aid on the same terms as non-ACP countries.
Furthermore, a higher degree of self-financing by the ACP countries would be in line with the ACP ambitions to be an autonomous player, and
the new agreement should include enhanced tools for building ACP countries' capacity to fund vital economic sectors.
Parliament noted the Commission communication of 7 June 2016 on establishing a new partnership framework with third countries under the
European Agenda on Migration. It noted that the EU budget and the EDF contribution to the package of EUR 8 billion is exclusively composed
of aid which was already planned. It called for development assistance to beneficiaries not to be jeopardised and for migration-related
initiatives to be financed with fresh appropriations.
Trade dimension: Members reiterated that Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) constitute a basis for regional cooperation and that they
must be instruments for development and regional integration. They called for a post-Cotonou Agreement as a political umbrella agreement
under which binding minimum requirements for EPAs are set, in order to ensure continuity for EPA linkages in the existing Cotonou Agreement
to sustainability provisions on good governance, respect for human rights, including among the most vulnerable people, and respect for social
and environmental standards.
Lastly, Parliament called for a joint parliamentary scrutiny and monitoring process on the impact of the EPA as well as structured civil society
monitoring mechanisms.
