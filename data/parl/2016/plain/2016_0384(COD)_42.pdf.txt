2016/0384(COD) - 30/11/2016 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to amend Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 as regards specific measures to provide additional assistance to Member States affected
by natural disaster.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: the recent earthquakes in Italy have had a devastating effect on the people living in the region. Large scale reconstruction
works will be required, notably to restore the cultural heritage of the affected areas.
Europe needs to be able to quickly provide additional, effective support from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) to Member
States and regions hit by major or regional natural disasters, complementing the means available under the European Union Solidarity Fund.
In order to provide such additional assistance to Member States affected by natural disasters, the Commission proposes to introduce the
possibility of a separate priority axis for reconstruction operations supported by the ERDF within an operational programme.
CONTENT: it is proposed to introduce an additional paragraph in Article 120 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 to provide for the creation of a
separate priority axis with a co-financing rate of up to 100% to support, under ERDF investment priorities, operations selected by managing
authorities in response to major or regional disasters.
The operations that may be cofinanced under this separate priority axis are those linked to reconstruction in response to major or regional
natural disasters as defined in Council Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002 establishing the European Union Solidarity Fund.
Starting date of eligibility of expenditure: for operations under this separate priority axis, a derogation to the rule concerning the starting date of
eligibility of expenditure as a result of an amendment of a programme is proposed. This would ensure that following the amendment of the
programme expenditure incurred as from the date of the disaster can be declared for reimbursement.
Covering expenses: a provision has also been included to cover the case of expenditure declared for measures taken by Member State
authorities directly after the disaster occurred, and before the operational programme is amended, and reimbursed at the existing co-financing
rate.
The higher co-financing rate would then be applied through the necessary adjustments to the next payment application and, where
appropriate, to the next accounts, once the programme has been amended to include the separate priority axis.
Reporting arrangements: the implementation of the measure will be monitored and reported upon in the framework of the general reporting
mechanisms established in Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposed modification does not imply any changes in the Multiannual Financial Framework annual ceilings
for commitments and payments as per Annex I of Regulation (EU) No 1311/2013.
It remains within the limits of the overall allocation for the period 2014-2020 and is therefore budgetary neutral. The increased co-financing rate
up to 100% will lead to a partial frontloading of payments, followed by lower payments at a later stage as the overall envelope is unchanged.

2016/0384(COD) - 23/03/2017 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Regional Development adopted the report by Iskra MIHAYLOVA (ADLE, BG) on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 as regards specific measures to provide additional
assistance to Member States affected by natural disasters.
The committee recommended that the European Parliaments position adopted at first reading, following the ordinary legislative procedure,
should take over the Commission proposal subject to a set of amendments concerning the co-financing rate.
The Commission proposed to introduce a separate priority axis, of which a co-financing rate up to 100% is proposed for reconstruction projects
supported by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) within an operational programme as laid down in Regulation (EU) No
1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards specific measures to provide additional assistance to Member States
affected by natural disaster.
Members introduced an amendment providing that the amount allocated to these operations shall not exceed 5 % of the total ERDF allocation
in a Member State for the 2014-2020 programming period.

2016/0384(COD) - 13/06/2017 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 625 votes to 5, with 28 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 as regards specific measures to provide additional
assistance to Member States affected by natural disasters.
The European Parliaments position adopted at first reading, following the ordinary legislative procedure, amended the Commission proposal.
The proposed amended Regulation provides for the possibility to introduce a separate priority axis, with a co-financing rate of up to 95%,

within an operational programme to support operations under the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) set by the Regulation (EU)
No 1301/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council with a view to providing additional assistance to Member States affected by
natural disasters.
An amendment stipulated that the amount allocated to these operations shall not exceed 5 % of the total ERDF allocation in a Member State
for the 2014-2020 programming period.

2016/0384(COD) - 04/07/2017 Final act
PURPOSE: to provide regions hit by earthquakes, floods or other natural disasters with increased EU support.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Regulation (EU) 2017/1199 of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 as
regards specific measures to provide additional assistance to Member States affected by natural disasters.
CONTENT: in order to provide additional assistance to Member States affected by natural disasters, this Regulation amends Regulation (EU)
1303/2013 by introducing a separate priority strand within an operational programme, with a co-financing rate of up to 95 % to cover the
European Regional Development Fund
(ERDF) investment priorities.
Operations benefitting from this measure should fulfil all of the following conditions:
·

they should be selected by managing authorities in response to major or regional natural disasters as defined in Regulation (EC) No
2012/2002 establishing the European Union Solidarity Fund;

·

they should be aimed at reconstruction in response to the natural disaster; and

·

they should be supported under an ERDF investment priority.

Expenditure for operations under this priority axis shall be eligible from the date when the natural disaster occurred.
The amount allocated to the operations referred to in the first subparagraph shall not exceed 5% of the total ERDF allocation in a Member
State for the 2014-2020 programming period.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 27.7.2017.
APPLICATION: from 1.1.2014.
