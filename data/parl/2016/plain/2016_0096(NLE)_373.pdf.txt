2016/0096(NLE) - 08/04/2016 Initial legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude the Agreement between the European Union and Solomon Islands on the short-stay visa waiver.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND:
Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council amended Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries
whose nationals must be in possession of a visa when crossing the external borders of the Member States and those whose nationals are
exempt from that requirement.
Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 was adopted on 20 May 2014 and entered into force on 9 June 2014. It is applied by all Member States with the
exception of Ireland and the United Kingdom.

In July 2014, the Commission presented a Recommendation to the Council to authorise it to start negotiations on visa waiver agreements with
each of the following 17 countries.
The first series of visa waiver agreements were signed on 6 May 2015 (United Arab Emirates), 26 May 2015 (Timor-Leste) and 28 May 2015
(Dominica, Grenada, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Trinidad and Tobago and Vanuatu) and provisionally apply from
the date of signature pending their entry into force. The Council has authorised the signature of a second series of visa waiver agreements
with Tonga (signed on 20 November 2015), Colombia (signed on 2 December 2015), Kiribati (date of signature to be determined) and Palau
(signed on 7 December 2015). These four agreements provisionally apply from the day following the date of signature pending their entry into
force.
The negotiations with Solomon Islands were opened on 19 November 2014. The agreement was initialled by the chief negotiators in Brussels
on 13 November 2015.
The Commission considers that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives were attained and that the draft visa waiver
agreement is acceptable to the Union.
CONTENT: the Commission calls on the Council to adopt a decision aiming to approve the Agreement between the European Union and
Solomon Islands on the short-stay visa waiver.
The final content of the agreement may be summarised as follows:
Purpose and duration of stay: the agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of
Solomon Islands when travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period. A joint
declaration on the interpretation of this period of 90 days in any 180-day period is attached to the agreement.
The agreement takes into account the situation of the Member States that do not yet apply the Schengen acquis in full. As long as they are not
part of the Schengen area without internal borders, the visa waiver confers a right for the nationals of Solomon Islands to stay for 90 days in
any 180-day on the territory of each of those Member States (currently Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania), independently of the period
calculated for the whole Schengen area.
A provision has been included in the agreement stating that Solomon Islands may suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all
the Member States of the European Union and that the Union may also only suspend or terminate the agreement in respect of all of its
Member States.
Scope: the visa waiver covers all categories of persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all
kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. For those travelling to carry out a paid activity, each Member State
and also Solomon Islands remain free to impose the visa requirement on the citizens of the other Party in accordance with the applicable
Union or national law. A joint declaration is attached to the agreement on the interpretation of the category of persons travelling for the purpose
of carrying out a paid activity.
Territorial application: in the case of France and the Netherlands, the visa waiver would entitle nationals of Solomon Islands to stay only in
those Member States? European territories.
The provisions of the Agreement do not apply to the United Kingdom or to Ireland.
A joint declaration on the association of Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein to the implementation, application and development of
the Schengen acquis is annexed to the agreement.
Lastly, the Agreement sets up a Joint Committee of experts for the management of the Agreement.

2016/0096(NLE) - 20/06/2016 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude, on behalf of the European Union, the Agreement between the European Union and Solomon Islands on the
short-stay visa waiver.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: the Commission negotiated, on behalf of the Union, an agreement with Solomon Islands on the short-stay visa waiver.
In accordance with a Council Decision, the Agreement has been signed and is applied on a provisional basis. The Agreement should now be
approved on behalf of the EU.
CONTENT: the draft Council Decision seeks the approval of the Agreement between the European Union and Solomon Islands on the
short-stay visa waiver is hereby approved on behalf of the Union.
The agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of Solomon Islands when travelling to
the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period . The visa waiver covers all categories of
persons (holders of ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passports) travelling for all kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of
carrying out a paid activity.
The future provisions of the Agreement shall not apply to the United Kingdom or Ireland.
The Agreement sets up a Joint Committee of experts for the management of the Agreement. The Union is to be represented within that Joint
Committee by the Commission, which should be assisted by the representatives of the Member States.

2016/0096(NLE) - 15/11/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading

The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs adopted the report by Mariya GABRIEL (EPP, BG) on the draft Council decision on
the conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Agreement between the European Union and the Solomon Islands on the short-stay
visa waiver.
The committee recommended that Parliament give its consent to conclusion of the agreement.
To recall, the agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of the Solomon Islands when
travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period . The visa waiver covers all
categories of persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all kinds of purposes, except for the
purpose of carrying out a paid activity.
The agreement was signed on 7 October 2016 in Brussels. Since that date, the agreement has been applied provisionally.
The report is accompanied by a short justification stating that the agreement represents a culmination of the deepening of relations between
the European Union and the Solomon Islands - which is politically highly significant in the context of the Cotonou Agreement and is an
additional way of stepping up economic and cultural relations and intensifying political dialogue on various issues, including human rights and
fundamental freedoms.
As regards the economy, the visa waiver agreement could have positive effects by simplifying travel for businesspeople, facilitating investment
and boosting tourism. Solomon Islands economy is based essentially on agriculture, accounting for 50 % of its GDP, and services,
representing almost 40 % of its GDP. While European Union trade relations with Solomon Islands are very limited, they have potential for
development. The European Union is currently negotiating a comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement with fourteen Pacific countries,
including Solomon Islands.
Politically, Solomon Islands is a constitutional monarchy within the Commonwealth since 1978. The European Union's political dialogue with
the Solomon Islands focuses on protecting its vulnerable environment, especially in relation to climate change on the one hand and on
defending human rights and gender issues on the other. The visa waiver agreement represents a significant step towards more regular and
enhanced political dialogues.
As regards mobility, the information available indicates that confidence in visa applicants is high and the rate of refusal of visas is low. In 2014
and 2015, no nationals of the Solomon Islands were arrested for being illegally present in the European Union and no refusal of entry at the
European Union external border or return decisions were taken concerning Solomon Islands nationals. Furthermore, no asylum applications
have been submitted by nationals of Solomon Islands. In this context, the country does not represent any threat in terms of either irregular
migration or of security and public order.
As regards the implementation and monitoring of the agreement, the rapporteur:
called on the Commission to observe any developments in relation to issues of clandestine immigration, public policy and security, but
also the Unions external relations with the third countries concerned, including, in particular, considerations relating to respect for
human rights and fundamental freedoms;
called on the Commission and the authorities of Tuvalu to ensure full reciprocity of the visa waiver, which should permit equal
treatment of all citizens, particularly all citizens of the Union;
encouraged the Commission to review the composition of the joint management committees for future agreements so that Parliament
might be involved in the work of the Joint Committee.
Lastly, the rapporteur also queried the practice of signing visa waiver agreements and applying them provisionally before the European
Parliament has approved them, a practice that is liable to reduce Parliaments room for manoeuvre.

2016/0096(NLE) - 01/12/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 562 votes to 53, with 27 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the draft Council decision on the
conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Agreement between the European Union and the Solomon Islands on the short-stay visa
waiver.
In line with the recommendation made by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, Parliament gave its consent to the
conclusion of the agreement.
The Agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of the Solomon Islands when travelling
to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period. The visa waiver covers all categories of
persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of
carrying out a paid activity.
The provisions of the Agreement shall not apply to the United Kingdom or Ireland.

2016/0096(NLE) - 07/02/2017 Final act
PURPOSE: to approve the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and Solomon Islands on the short-stay visa waiver.
NON LEGISLATIVE ACT: Council Decision (EU) 2017/235 on the conclusion, on behalf of the Union, of the Agreement between the European
Union and Solomon Islands on the short-stay visa waiver.
CONTENT : the Council approved the Agreement between the European Union and Solomon Islands on the short-stay visa waiver, on behalf
of the Union.
To recall, the Commission negotiated on behalf of the Union an agreement with Solomon Islands on the short-stay visa waiver. This
Agreement was signed and was provisionally applied from 8 October 2016.

The Agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the Union and for the citizens of Solomon Islands when travelling to the territory
of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period . The visa waiver covers all categories of persons
(ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of carrying out a
paid activity.
For those travelling to carry out a paid activity, each Member State and also Solomon Islands remain free to impose the visa requirement on
the citizens of the other Party in accordance with the applicable Union or national law. Member States and Solomon Islands have reserved the
right to prevent a person entering their respective territories or making a short stay there, if one or several conditions relating to short stay or
entry are not fulfilled.
The Agreement sets up a Joint Committee of experts for the management of the Agreement. The Union is to be represented within that Joint
Committee by the Commission, which will be assisted by the representatives of the Member States.
The Decision constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in which the United Kingdom and Ireland do not take part.
The latter two Member States are therefore not taking part in the adoption of the Decision and are not bound by it or subject to its application.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 7.2.2017.
