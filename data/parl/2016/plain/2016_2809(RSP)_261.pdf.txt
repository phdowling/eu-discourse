Summary

2016/2809(RSP) - 07/07/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a resolution on Myanmar, in particular the situation of the Rohingya.
The text adopted in plenary was adopted by the EPP, S&D, ECR, ALDE, GUE/NGL, Greens/ EFA and EFDD groups.
Parliament recalled that Myanmar has taken significant steps to reform its economy and political system, and whereas wide-ranging reforms
have been initiated since 2011. However, the Rohingya are an ethno-religious Muslim minority who have for decades suffered brutal
oppression, systematic persecution, segregation and exclusion.
It recalled the Rohingya represent the largest percentage of Muslims in Myanmar, with the majority living in Rakhine State.
Parliament noted that the approximately one million Rohingya are one of the worlds most persecuted minorities, and have been officially
stateless since the 1982 Burmese Citizenship Law. It also stated that Ms Suu Kyi announced in a meeting with the UN Special Rapporteur on
the situation of human rights in Myanmar, Yanghee Lee, that the government will not use the word Rohingya (a continuation of the policy
practised under the military dictatorship), as it is considered inflammatory, as is the word Bengali, and that it is instead suggesting the new
term Muslim community in Rakhine State.
Parliament stated that the Rohingya population (both inside and outside Rakhine State) is the target of violent, aggressive and discriminatory
propaganda and actions perpetrated by a number of radical Buddhist groups in Myanmar. In this respect, it urged the government and the
relevant authorities of all countries in the region to fully comply with the principle of non-refoulement and to protect Rohingya refugees, in line
with their international obligations and with international human rights standards.
Overall, Parliament reiterated its deepest concern about the plight of Rohingya refugees in South-East Asia and called for regional and
international mobilisation to provide them with urgent assistance.
Parliament called on the Myanmar Government to:
to ensure free and unimpeded access to Rakhine State for humanitarian actors, the UN, international human rights organisations,
journalists and other international observers;
to condemn unequivocally all incitement to racial or religious hatred in the future;
to implement immediately the recommendations set out in the resolution adopted at the 31st session of the UN Human Rights Council
(UNHRC) on the situation of human rights in Myanmar;
to safeguard the Rohingya people from any form of discrimination and to end impunity for violations against the Rohingya;
to reform the 1982 Citizenship Law and to restore the Rohingya minoritys citizenship;
to immediately start registering all children at birth;
to repeal all discriminatory provisions.
The EU is called for:
to continue to support the UNHRC in its efforts to help Rohingya refugees in the South and South-East Asia region;
to support the UNHRC Global 2014-24 Action Plan to End Statelessness;
to address the situation of the Rohingya at the highest possible political level in her contacts with Myanmar and with other ASEAN
member countries.
Lastly, Parliament called for caution on the conclusion of the planned EU-Myanmar investment agreement, as it could endanger the future
socially balanced development of Myanmar as long as legislation on corporate social and environmental responsibilities and liabilities, labour
rights, land ownership and anti-corruption measures are still largely absent.
