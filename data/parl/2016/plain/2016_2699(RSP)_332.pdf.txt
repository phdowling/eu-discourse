Summary

2016/2699(RSP) - 08/06/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 501 votes to 94, with 73 abstentions, a resolution on the situation in Venezuela.
The text adopted in plenary was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ECR and ALDE groups.
Expressing grave concern at the seriously deteriorating situation as regards democracy, human rights and the socio-economic situation in
Venezuela, where the political and social climate is becoming more unstable, Parliament called on the Venezuelan Government to respect the
rule of law and the principle of the separation of powers. It recalled that there are around 2 000 people in prison, under house arrest or on
probation for political reasons and that the rule of law and the principle of the separation of powers are not duly respected in Venezuela.
Therefore, Parliament called on the Venezuelan Government to adopt a constructive attitude in order to overcome Venezuelas current critical
situation. In this regard, it called on the Venezuelan authorities to:
release immediately the political prisoners;
guarantee security and the free exercise of rights for all citizens, in particular human rights defenders, journalists and political activists.
It called on President Nicolas Maduro and his government to implement urgent economic reforms in cooperation with the National Assembly in
order to find a constructive solution to the economic and energy crises, in particular the shortage of food and medicines.
Expressing serious concern at the increasingly deteriorating social tension in this country, Parliament urged the VP/HR to cooperate with Latin
American countries and regional and international organisations to ensure that mechanisms for dialogue, national reconciliation and mediation
are put in place in Venezuela. It considered it an absolute priority to reduce the existing high levels of impunity, which increase and foster the
growing violence and insecurity in the country, and to ensure respect for the existing legal system.
Parliament called on the Venezuelan authorities to investigate the Tumeremo massacre, in which 28 miners were murdered, with a view to
bringing the perpetrators and instigators to justice.
Lastly, it reiterated its request for a European Parliament delegation to be sent to Venezuela and to hold a dialogue with all sectors involved in
the conflict as soon as possible.
