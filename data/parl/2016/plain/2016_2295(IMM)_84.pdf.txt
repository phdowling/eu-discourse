Summary

2016/2295(IMM) - 28/02/2017 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Legal Affairs adopted the report by Laura Ferrara (EFDD, IT) on the request for waiver of the immunity of Marine LE PEN
(ENF, FR).
The French judicial authorities requested that the immunity of Marine Le Pen, Member of the European Parliament and Chair of the Front
National (FN) party, should be waived in connection with proceedings relating to the posting on her Twitter account of violent images.
The report noted that in line with the established legal practice of the European Parliament, immunity may be waived where opinions

expressed and/or images that are the subject of legal action have no clear or direct connection with the performance of parliamentary duties by
the Member of the European Parliament and do not constitute opinions expressed or votes cast in the performance of those duties.
Members recalled that the dissemination of violent images likely to undermine human dignity is an offence under the French Criminal Code.
They recalled that the images posted by Marine Le Pen can be accessed by anyone via Google and that they have been widely reposted on
the internet since they appeared on her Twitter account, this does not alter the fact that their violent nature is likely to undermine human
dignity.
Members stated that the speed at which legal proceedings have been taken against Marine Le Pen is comparable to the pace of other
proceedings in matters relating to the press and other media, and there is no reason to suspect that this may be a case of fumus persecutionis
, i.e. a situation in which there are signs or evidence of an intent to persecute an individual.
Therefore, on the basis of the abovementioned information, the Committee on Legal Affairs recommended the European Parliament to waive
the immunity of Marine Le Pen.

2016/2295(IMM) - 02/03/2017 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament decided to waive the immunity of Marine Le Pen (ENF, FR).
The French judicial authorities requested that the immunity of Marine Le Pen, Member of the European Parliament and Chair of the Front
National (FN) party, should be waived in connection with proceedings relating to the posting on her Twitter account of violent images.
It is the established legal practice of the European Parliament that immunity may be waived where opinions expressed and/or images that are
the subject of legal action have no clear or direct connection with the performance of parliamentary duties by the Member of the European
Parliament and do not constitute opinions expressed or votes cast in the performance of those duties.
Given that there is no reason to suspect that this may be a case of fumus persecutionis, i.e. a situation in which there are signs or evidence of
an intent to damage a Members political activity, Parliament considered that the Parliamentary immunity of Marine Le Pen should be waived.
