2016/0820(CNS) - 13/12/2016 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to authorise Slovakia, Bulgaria, France, Czech Republic, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Hungary, Cyprus, Estonia, Malta, Romania
and Finland to continue to receive and supply of personal data for the purpose of automated searching of dactyloscopic data (digital
fingerprints).
PROPOSED ACT: Council Implementing Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to
follow its opinion.
BACKGROUND: Council Decision 2008/615/JHA on the stepping up of cross-border cooperation, particularly in combating terrorism and
cross-border crime, confers upon the Council implementing powers with a view to adopting measures necessary to implement that Decision, in
particular as regards the receipt and supply of personal data provided for under that Decision.
The supply of personal data provided for under that Decision may not take place until the general provisions on data protection have been
implemented in the national law of the territories of the Member States involved in such supply.
Council Decision 2008/616/JHA provides that the verification that the condition with respect to automated data exchange has been met is to be
done on the basis of an evaluation report based on a questionnaire, an evaluation visit and a pilot run.
The overall evaluation reports, summarising the results of the questionnaire, the evaluation visit and the pilot run concerning dactyloscopic
data in Slovakia, Bulgaria, France, Czech Republic, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Hungary, Cyprus, Estonia, Malta, Romania and Finland have
been presented to the Council.
On the basis of these evaluation reports, Decisions 2010/682/EU, 2010/758/EU, 2011/355/EU, 2011/434/EU, 2011/888/EU, 2012/46/EU,
2012/446/EU, 2012/672/EU, 2012/710/EU, 2013/153/EU, 2013/229/EU and 2013/792/EU authorised Slovakia, Bulgaria, France, Czech
Republic, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Hungary, Cyprus, Estonia, Malta, Romania and Finland to continue to be entitled to receive and supply
personal data for the purpose of automated searching of dactyloscopic data.
In its judgment of 22 September, the Court of Justice annulled the above-mentioned Decisions on the basis that they are vitiated by a
procedural defect. With a view to ensuring the legal certainty of the receipt and supply of personal data with regard to the Member States
concerned, those Decisions should be replaced by this present draft Decision.
CONTENT: the proposed Council implementing Decision seeks, for the purpose of automated searching of dactyloscopic data, to authorise
Slovakia, Bulgaria, France, Czech Republic, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Hungary, Cyprus, Estonia, Malta, Romania and Finland to continue to
be entitled to receive and supply personal data pursuant to Decision 2008/615/JHA.
Decisions 2010/682/EU, 2010/758/EU, 2011/355/EU, 2011/434/EU, 2011/888/EU, 2012/46/EU, 2012/446/EU, 2012/672/EU, 2012/710/EU,
2013/153/EU, 2013/229/EU and 2013/792/EU cease to produce effects as from the date of entry into force of this Decision, without prejudice
to the validity of automated data exchange carried out pursuant to those Decisions by the Member States.
Member States which obtained personal data pursuant to these Decisions shall continue to be entitled to further process those data at national

level or between Member States for the purposes laid down in Article 26 of Decision 2008/615/JHA.
The United Kingdom and Ireland shall participate in the adoption of the proposed Decision.

2016/0820(CNS) - 28/03/2017 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs adopted, in line with its consultation procedure, the report by Tomá ZDECHOVSKÝ
(EPP, CZ) on the draft Council implementing decision on the automated data exchange with regard to dactyloscopic data in Slovakia, Bulgaria,
France, Czech Republic, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Hungary, Cyprus, Estonia, Malta, Romania and Finland and replacing Decisions
2010/682/EU, 2010/758/EU, 2011/355/EU, 2011/434/EU, 2011/888/EU, 2012/46/EU, 2012/446/EU, 2012/672/EU, 2012/710/EU, 2013/153/EU,
2013/229/EU and 2013/792/EU.
The committee recommended the European Parliament to approve the Council draft.
The proposed Council implementing Decision seeks, for the purpose of automated searching of dactyloscopic data, to authorise Slovakia,
Bulgaria, France, Czech Republic, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Hungary, Cyprus, Estonia, Malta, Romania and Finland to continue to be
entitled to receive and supply personal data pursuant to Decision 2008/615/JHA on the stepping up of cross-border cooperation, particularly in
combating terrorism and cross-border crime.

2016/0820(CNS) - 05/04/2017 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 592 votes to 78, with 21 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the draft Council implementing decision
on the automated data exchange with regard to dactyloscopic data in Slovakia, Bulgaria, France, Czech Republic, Lithuania, the Netherlands,
Hungary, Cyprus, Estonia, Malta, Romania and Finland and replacing Decisions 2010/682/EU, 2010/758/EU, 2011/355/EU, 2011/434/EU,
2011/888/EU, 2012/46/EU, 2012/446/EU, 2012/672/EU, 2012/710/EU, 2013/153/EU, 2013/229/EU and 2013/792/EU.
The Council consulted Parliament pursuant to Article 39(1) of the Treaty on European Union, as amended by the Treaty of Amsterdam, and
Article 9 of Protocol No 36 on transitional provisions.
In line with its Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, Parliament approved the Council draft.

2016/0820(CNS) - 18/05/2017 Final act
PURPOSE: to authorise Slovakia, Bulgaria, France, Czech Republic, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Hungary, Cyprus, Estonia, Malta, Romania
and Finland to continue to receive and supply of personal data for the purpose of automated searching of dactyloscopic data (digital

NON LEGISLATIVE ACT: Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2017/946 on the automated data exchange with regard to dactyloscopic data
in Slovakia, Bulgaria, France, Czech Republic, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Hungary, Cyprus, Estonia, Malta, Romania and Finland and
replacing Decisions 2010/682/EU, 2010/758/EU, 2011/355/EU, 2011/434/EU, 2011/888/EU, 2012/46/EU, 2012/446/EU, 2012/672/EU,
2012/710/EU, 2013/153/EU, 2013/229/EU and 2013/792/EU.
CONTENT: through this Council Implementing Decision, Slovakia, Bulgaria, France, Czech Republic, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Hungary,
Cyprus, Estonia, Malta, Romania and Finland remain authorised to continue to receive and supply personal data in accordance with Decision
2008/615/JAI for the purpose of automated searching of dactyloscopic data.
To recall, Council Decision 2008/615/JAI on the stepping up of cross-border cooperation, particularly in combating terrorism and cross-border
crime, provides that the supply of personal data may not take place until the Member States involved in such supply have implemented in
national law the general provisions on data protection set out in that Decision.
An overall evaluation report, summarising the results of the questionnaire, the evaluation visit and the pilot run concerning dactyloscopic data
exchange in Latvia has been presented to the Council.
On the basis of these evaluation reports, Decisions 2010/682/EU, 2010/758/EU, 2011/355/EU, 2011/434/EU, 2011/888/EU, 2012/46/EU,
2012/446/EU, 2012/672/EU, 2012/710/EU, 2013/153/EU, 2013/229/EU and 2013/792/EU authorised Slovakia, Bulgaria, France, Czech
Republic, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Hungary, Cyprus, Estonia, Malta, Romania and Finland to continue to be entitled to receive and supply
personal data for the purpose of automated searching of dactyloscopic data.
In its judgment of 22 September, the Court of Justice annulled the above-mentioned Decisions on the basis that they are vitiated by a
procedural defect. With a view to ensuring the legal certainty of the receipt and supply of personal data with regard to the Member States
concerned, this Decision replaces the Decisions annulled by the Court.
The Member States that obtained personal data pursuant to these Decisions are entitled to further process those data at national level or
between Member States.
ENTRY INTO FORCE : 3.6.2017. From that date, Decisions 2010/682/EU, 2010/758/EU, 2011/355/EU, 2011/434/EU, 2011/888/EU,
2012/46/EU, 2012/446/EU, 2012/672/EU, 2012/710/EU, 2013/153/EU, 2013/229/EU and 2013/792/EU cease to apply.
