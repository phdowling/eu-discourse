2016/2182(DEC) - 11/07/2016 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: presentation by the Commission of the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2015, as part of
the 2015 discharge procedure.
Analysis of the accounts of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA).
CONTENT: the organisational governance of the EU consists of institutions, agencies and other EU bodies whose expenditure is included in
the general budget of the Union.
The EU's operational expenditure of these institutions takes different forms, depending on how the money is paid out and managed.
From 2014 onwards, the Commission classifies its expenditure as follows:
Direct management: the budget is implemented directly by the Commission services.
Indirect management: the Commission confers tasks of implementation of the budget to bodies of EU law or national law, such as the
EU agencies.
Shared management: under this method of budget implementation tasks are delegated to Member States. About 80 % of the
expenditure falls under this management mode covering such areas as agricultural spending and structural actions.
This Commission document concerns the EU's consolidated accounts for the year 2015 and details how spending by the EU institutions and
bodies was carried out. The consolidated annual accounts of the EU provide financial information on the activities of the institutions, agencies
and other bodies of the EU from an accrual accounting and budgetary perspective.
It is the responsibility of the Commission's Accounting Officer to prepare the EU's consolidated annual accounts and ensure that they present
fairly, in all material aspects, the financial position, the result of the operations and the cash flows of the EU institutions and bodies, including
the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), with a view to granting discharge.

Discharge procedure: the final step of a budget lifecycle is the discharge of the budget for a given financial year. It represents the political
aspect of the external control of budget implementation and is the decision by which the European Parliament, acting on a Council
recommendation, "releases" the Commission (and other EU bodies) from its responsibility for management of a given budget by marking the
end of that budget's existence. The European Parliament is the discharge authority within the EU.
The discharge procedure may produce three outcomes: (i) the granting; (ii) postponement or; (iii) the refusal of the discharge.
The final discharge report including specific recommendations to the Commission for action is adopted in plenary by the European Parliament
and are subject to an annual follow up report in which the Commission outlines the concrete actions it has taken to implement the
recommendations made.
Each agency is subject to its own discharge procedure, including the ECHA.
The European Chemicals Agency: the Agency, which is located in Helsinki (FI), was created by Council Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the
European Parliament and the Council to help businesses comply with the legislation in force, promote the safe use of chemicals, provide
information on chemicals and assess hazardous substances.
As regards the Agencys accounts, these are presented in detail in the document on the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union
for 2015:
Commitment appropriations:
-

committed: EUR 115 million;

-

paid: EUR 113 million;

-

carried-over: 0.

Payment appropriations:
-

committed: EUR 126 million;

-

paid: EUR 111 million;

-

carried-over: EUR 13 million.

For further details on expenditure, please refer to the final accounts of the ECHA.

2016/2182(DEC) - 13/09/2016 Court of Auditors: opinion, report
PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) for the
financial year 2015, together with the Agencys reply.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit focused on the annual accounts of the European Chemicals Agency. To recall, its main tasks are to ensure a high level of protection
of human health and the environment as well as the free movement of substances on the internal market while enhancing competitiveness
and innovation. It also seeks to promote the development of alternative methods for the assessment of hazards relating to substances.
Statement of Assurance: pursuant to the provisions of Article 287 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the Court
has audited:
the annual accounts of the Agency, which comprise the financial statements and the reports on the implementation of the budget for
the financial year ended 31 December 2015;
the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying those accounts.
Opinion on the reliability of the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the Agencys annual accounts present fairly, in all material respects, its
financial position as at 31 December 2015 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the
provisions of its Financial Regulation and the accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
Opinion on the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the accounts: the Court considers that the transactions underlying the
annual accounts for the year ended 31 December 2015 are legal and regular in all material respects. However, the Court did make a comment
about a communication problem concerning the cost of after-school care of staff children in the European School in Helsinki.
The report made a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of the Agency, accompanied by the latters response.
The main observations may be summarised as follows:
The Courts observations:
budgetary management: the Court noted that carry-overs of committed appropriations were high for biocides operating expenditure at
EUR 1.5 million. They mainly concern a large scale IT project (EUR 1.4 million). This project could only be started in the second half of
2015 when sufficient fee income for its funding had been collected.
The Agencys reply:
budgetary management: the ECHA appreciated the conclusion of the European Court of Auditors and will continue to be attentive to
avoid any non-justified carry-over operations.

Lastly, the Court of Auditors report also contained a summary of the Agencys key figures in 2015:
Budget: EUR 115.1 million (payment appropriations).
Staff: 572 including officials, temporary and contract staff and seconded national experts.

2016/2182(DEC) - 07/02/2017 Supplementary non-legislative basic document
Having examined the revenue and expenditure accounts for the financial year 2015 and the balance sheet as at 31 December 2015 of the
European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), as well as the Court of Auditors' report on the annual accounts of the Agency for the financial year
2015, accompanied by the Agency's replies to the Court's observations, the Council recommended the European Parliament to give a
discharge to the Executive Director of the Agency in respect of the implementation of the budget for the financial year 2015.
The Council welcomed the Court's opinion that, in all material respects, the Agency's annual accounts present fairly its financial position as at
31 December 2015 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions of the
Agency's Financial Regulation, and that the underlying transactions for 2015 are legal and regular in all material respects.
Nevertheless, it made some observations as follows:
financial programming: the Council acknowledged the multiannual nature of the Agency's IT-related projects and noted that a high
level of commitment appropriations was carried over to 2016. It encouraged the Agency to continue improving its financial
programming and monitoring of the budget implementation, in order to reduce the level of commitments carried over to the following
financial year to the minimum strictly necessary.

2016/2182(DEC) - 28/03/2017 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Inés AYALA SENDER (S&D, ES) on discharge in respect of the implementation of
the budget of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) for the financial year 2015.
The committee called on the European Parliament to grant the Executive Director of the Agency discharge in respect of the implementation of
the agencys budget for the financial year 2015.
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it had obtained reasonable assurance that the annual accounts of the Agency for the financial year
2015 were reliable and that the underlying transactions were legal and regular, Members called on Parliament to approve the closure of the
Agencys accounts. They made, however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is granted,
in addition to the general recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU
agencies:
Agencys financial statements: Members noted that the final budget of the Agency for the financial year 2015 was EUR 114 412 841
representing an increase of 0.26 % compared to 2014.
Legality and regularity of transactions: Members stated that the Agency paid 50 % of the cost for after-school care of staff children in
the European School in Helsinki. This contribution is limited to EUR 1 000 per child per year, amounting to approximately EUR 95 000
in 2015. Members took note that this measure was not communicated to the budgetary authority in the framework of the budget
procedure. The Agency will communicate this measure to the budgetary authority in its 2018-2020 programming document. The
Agency already updated the remarks on the relevant budget line by including the information about this measure in the first
amendment to the Agencys 2016 budget.
Members also made a series of observations regarding budgetary and financial management, commitments and carry-overs, transfers,
procurement and recruitment procedures, the prevention and management of conflicts of interests and internal audits and controls.
On the prevention and conflicts of interests, Members stated that the Agency has implemented a robust conflict of interest policy and a
detailed anti-fraud strategy in order to contribute to a culture of high ethical behaviour among the staff and experts working for the Agency.
Lastly, Members took note that the Agency developed a new integrated regulatory strategy which brings all REACH and CLP processes
together to reach the aims of relevant regulations, as well as the 2020 goals of the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development.

2016/2182(DEC) - 27/04/2017 Final act
PURPOSE: to grant discharge to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) for the financial year 2015.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision (EU) 2017/1660 of the European Parliament on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of
the European Chemicals Agency for the financial year 2015.
CONTENT: with the present decision, the European Parliament grants discharge to the Executive Director of the European Chemicals Agency
discharge in respect of the implementation of the Agency's budget for the financial year 2015.
This decision is in line with the European Parliament's resolution adopted on 27 April 2017 and comprises a series of observations that form
an integral part of the discharge decision (please refer to the summary of the opinion of 27 April 2017).
Amongst Parliaments main observations in the resolution accompanying the discharge decision, the latter noted that, in line with the discharge
authority's recommendation from the previous year, it will include in its next annual report a separate chapter on transparency, accountability
and integrity.
Parliament welcomed that the CVs and declarations of interests are well organised, visible, accessible and user-friendly on the Agency's
website and that the guidelines for whistleblowers were adopted in December 2015.

Parliament noted that the Agency has implemented a robust conflict of interest policy and a detailed anti-fraud strategy in order to contribute to
a culture of high ethical behaviour among the staff and experts working for the Agency.
Lastly, it welcomed the progress made in developing the authorisation process under the REACH Regulation and noted the Agency's
conclusions that further improvements can still be made. The Agencys proactive approach in seeking a dialogue with Parliament to address
issues raised in its resolution of 25 November 2015 on the draft Commission Implementing Decision granting an authorisation for uses of
bis(2-ethylhexhyl) phthalate (DEHP) under Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council was welcomed.

2016/2182(DEC) - 27/04/2017 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament decided to grant discharge to the Executive Director of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) in respect of the
implementation of its budget for the financial year 2015.
The vote on the decision on discharge covers the closure of the accounts (in accordance with Annex IV, Article 5 (1) (a) to Parliaments Rules
of Procedure).
Noting that the Court of Auditors has stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the Agencys annual accounts for the financial year
2015 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Parliament adopted by 512 votes to 106 with 2 abstentions, a
resolution containing a series of recommendations, which form an integral part of the decision on discharge and which add to the general
recommendations set out in the resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies.
These recommendations may be summarised as follows:
Agencys financial statements: Parliament noted that the final budget of the Agency for the financial year 2015 was EUR 114 412 841
representing an increase of 0.26 % compared to 2014.
Legality and regularity of transactions: It stated that the Agency paid 50 % of the cost for after-school care of staff children in the
European School in Helsinki. This contribution is limited to EUR 1 000 per child per year, amounting to approximately EUR 95 000 in
2015. Parliament took note that this measure was not communicated to the budgetary authority in the framework of the budget
procedure. The Agency will communicate this measure to the budgetary authority in its 2018-2020 programming document. The
Agency already updated the remarks on the relevant budget line by including the information about this measure in the first
amendment to the Agencys 2016 budget.
Parliament also made a series of observations regarding budgetary and financial management, commitments and carry-overs, transfers,
procurement and recruitment procedures, the prevention and management of conflicts of interests and internal audits and controls.
On the prevention and conflicts of interests, it stated that the Agency has implemented a robust conflict of interest policy and a detailed
anti-fraud strategy in order to contribute to a culture of high ethical behaviour among the staff and experts working for the Agency.
Parliament took note that the Agency developed a new integrated regulatory strategy which brings all REACH and CLP processes together to
reach the aims of relevant regulations, as well as the 2020 goals of the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development.
Communication: Parliament welcomed the improvement of the way in which information on chemicals is presented on the Agencys website,
which helps companies and consumers to make more use of it. It noted that the discussion platform between the Agency and
non-governmental organisations is a useful forum for discussing the main issues of interest to civil society.
