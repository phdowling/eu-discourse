2016/0159(COD) - 30/05/2016 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to replace the lists of insolvency proceedings and insolvency practitioners in Annexes A and B to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 on
insolvency proceedings.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council on insolvency proceedings (recast) entered into
force on 26 June 2015. It will apply from 26 June 2017, with the exception of the part relating to the system for interconnection of national
insolvency registers, which will apply from 26 June 2019.
Annex A to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 lists the insolvency proceedings referred to in point (4) of Article 2 of the Regulation. Annex B lists the
insolvency practitioners referred to in point (5) of Article 2.

In December 2015, Poland notified the Commission on a substantial reform of its domestic law on restructuring, taking effect as of 1 January
2016, and requested to change the lists set out in Annexes A and B to the Regulation accordingly.
After having carefully analysed the request of Poland in order to ensure compliance of the notification with the requirements of the Regulation,
the Commission is proposing to amend Regulation ((EU) 2015/848 accordingly.
CONTENT: the Commission proposal seeks to replace the lists for Poland in Annexes A and B to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 with new lists
taking into account the information notified by that Member States. Since the Annexes are intrinsic part of the Regulation, their modification
can only be achieved via the legislative amendment of the Regulation.
This proposal aims at ensuring that the scope of the recast Regulation is adjusted to the actual legal framework of the Member States on
insolvency by the time of its application.
The envisaged amendments are of a purely technical nature. They contain no substantive change to the Regulation.

2016/0159(COD) - 23/11/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Legal Affairs adopted the report by Tadeusz ZWIEFKA (EPP, PL) on the proposal for a regulation of the European
Parliament and of the Council replacing the lists of insolvency proceedings and insolvency practitioners in Annexes A and B to Regulation (EU)
2015/848 on insolvency proceedings.
As a reminder, Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council on insolvency proceedings entered into force on 26
June 2015. It will apply from 26 June 2017, with the exception of the part relating to the system for interconnection of national insolvency
registers, which will apply from 26 June 2019.
This Regulation includes as Annexes lists of insolvency proceedings and insolvency practitioners relevant to its application. Annex A to
Regulation (EU) 2015/848 lists the insolvency proceedings referred to in point (4) of Article 2 of the Regulation. Annex B lists the insolvency
practitioners referred to in point (5) of Article 2.
In December 2015, Poland notified the Commission on a substantial reform of its domestic law on restructuring, which would take effect as of
1 January 2016, and requested a modification of the lists set out in Annexes A and B to the Regulation accordingly.
The Commission proposal seeks to replace the lists for Poland in Annexes A and B to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 with new lists taking into
account the information notified by that Member States.
The committee recommended that the European Parliaments position adopted at first reading under the ordinary legislative procedure should
amend the Commission proposal as follows :
Two amendments reflect the position of the United Kingdom and of Ireland respectively with regard to the Commission proposal pursuant to
Protocol (No 21) on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice. These amendments
recalled that, in accordance with Protocol (No 21):
the United Kingdom has given notice of its wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Regulation on 1 September 2016
(he United Kingdom participated in the adoption and application of Regulation (EU) 2015/848 on insolvency proceedings);
Ireland will not participate in the adoption of this Regulation and will not be bound by it or be subject to its application (the possibility
for Ireland to accept this new regulation will always be open after its adoption pursuant to the above-mentioned Protocol).
The third amendment aligns the entry into application of the amending regulation with that of Regulation (EU) 2015/848: thus, the amending
Regulation will enter into force on 26 June 2017.

2016/0159(COD) - 14/12/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 640 votes to 30, with 32 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council replacing the lists of insolvency proceedings and insolvency practitioners in Annexes A and B to
Regulation (EU) 2015/848 on insolvency proceedings.
The Commission proposal seeks to replace the lists for Poland in Annexes A and B to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 with new lists taking into
account the information notified by that Member States.
Parliaments position adopted at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure amended the Commission proposal as follows:
reflect the position of the United Kingdom and of Ireland respectively with regard to the Commission proposal pursuant to Protocol (No
21) on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice. These amendments
recalled that, in accordance with Protocol (No 21): (a) the United Kingdom has given notice of its wish to take part in the adoption and
application of this Regulation; (b) Ireland will not participate in the adoption of this Regulation and will not be bound by it or be subject
to its application;
aligns the entry into application of the amending regulation with that of Regulation (EU) 2015/848: thus, the amending Regulation will
enter into force on 26 June 2017.
