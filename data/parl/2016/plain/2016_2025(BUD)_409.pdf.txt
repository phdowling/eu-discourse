2016/2025(BUD) - 22/02/2016 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: to mobilise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) to finance technical assistance at the initiative of the Commission.
PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
CONTENT: the rules applicable to financial contributions from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) are laid down in Regulation
(EU) No 1309/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (2014-2020).
In accordance with Article 11(1) of the EGF Regulation, a maximum of 0.5 % of the annual maximum amount of the EGF may be made
available each year for technical assistance at the initiative of the Commission.
Assistance technique à financer (EGF/2016/000 TA 2016) et ventilation de son coût estimatif: la Commission entend mobiliser un
montant de 630.000 EUR pour le financement des tâches suivantes:
Technical assistance to be funded (EGF/2016/000 TA 2016) and breakdown of its estimated costs: the Commission intends to
mobilise EUR 380 000 to finance the following:
Monitoring and data gathering: the Commission will collect data on applications received, paid and wound up, and measures proposed
and implemented. This data will be made available on the web site and compiled in appropriate form for the Biennial Report of 2017.
Building on the work of recent years, costs for this activity will be EUR 20 000.
Information: the web site on the EGF, which the Commission has set up will be regularly updated and expanded, with each new
element also being translated into all EU languages. General awareness of the EGF will be increased and its visibility promoted. The
EGF will be covered in various Commission publications and audio-visual activities. Costs of all these items are estimated at EUR 20
000 in 2016.
Creation of a knowledge base / application interface: the Commission is continuing its work setting up standardised procedures for
EGF applications and management. Preparation and fine tuning of the module for final reports closing the implementation of each
EGF case will be the priority of the year. The cost of these items is estimated at EUR 100 000, being the EGF contribution to the
development of SFC and its regular maintenance.
Administrative and technical support: the Expert Group of Contact Persons of the EGF, with one member from each Member State,

will be holding two meetings (end of 2016 / first half of 2017), together estimated at EUR 70 000.
Networking: the Commission will organise two seminars with the participation of EGF implementing bodies and social partners. To the
extent possible, these will be scheduled to take place around the same dates as the Expert Group meetings and will focus on issues
arising from the practical implementation of the EGF Regulation at grassroots level. The cost of these seminars is estimated at EUR
120 000.
Evaluation: public procurement for the mid-term evaluation was completed in 2015, with a view to concluding the evaluation by 30
June 2017. In 2016, EUR 50 000 are budgeted to allow finalisation, translations and publication of the report in time for presentation in
mid2017. No evaluation expenditure will be budgeted in 2017.
Financing: Article 11(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1309/2013 (EGF Regulation) provides that a maximum of 0.5% of the annual maximum amount
(i.e. EUR 828 060 in 2016) can be made available for technical assistance at the initiative of the Commission. Currently, the entire amount for
2016 remains available; nothing has yet been allocated to technical assistance. The proposed amount corresponds to about 0.23% of the
maximum annual budget available for the EGF in 2016.
The proposed decision to mobilise the EGF will be taken jointly by the European Parliament and the Council, as laid down in point 13 of the
Interinstitutional Agreement of 2 December 2013 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline,
on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management.
At the same time as it presents this proposal for a decision to mobilise the EGF, the Commission will present to the European Parliament and
to the Council a proposal for a transfer to the relevant budgetary line for the amount of EUR 380 000.
Source of payment appropriations: appropriations from the EGF budget line will be used to cover the amount of EUR 380 000 needed for
technical assistance.

2016/2025(BUD) - 06/04/2016 Budgetary report tabled for plenary, 1st reading
The Committee on Budgets adopted the report by Andrey NOVAKOV (EPP, BG) on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament
and of the Council on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for an amount of EUR 380 000 in commitment and
payment appropriations for technical assistance at the intiative of the Commission (EGF/2016/000 TA 2016).
Members recalled that the Union set up legislative and budgetary instruments to provide additional support to workers who are suffering from
the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns and to assist their reintegration into the labour market.
They also recalled that the proposed amount of EUR 380 000 corresponds to approximately 0.23 % of the maximum annual budget available
for the EGF in 2016. Accordingly, they called upon Parliament to approve the proposed amount and measures.
Furthermore, the committee recalled the importance of networking and exchange of information on the EGF and supported, therefore, the
funding of the Expert Group of Contact Persons of the EGF and the networking seminars on the implementation of the EGF.
It welcomed the continued work on the standardised procedures for EGF applications and management using the functionalities of the
electronic data exchange system (SFC2014). Members regretted, however, that the Commission did not present the progress of integration
into SFC2014 from the beginning of 2011 until 2014 as requested in Parliament's resolution of 24 June 2015 on the proposal for the Technical
Assistance in 2015.
They welcomed the fact that the Commission intends to invest EUR 70 000 of the available budget under the Technical Assistance in
particular on improving the monitoring and evaluation of the impact of EGF support on individual participants. They recommended:
·

the budget for monitoring and evaluation be used to assess the longer term impact on EGF beneficiaries, the effectiveness and
efficiency of deploying support on the ground as well as to carry out a deeper analysis of the economic mutations causing the
dismissals of EGF beneficiaries;

·

the EGF coordinator and the Member State provide reliable and complete data on employment outcomes of beneficiaries twelve
months after the implementation of the measures;

·

more detailed information on the measures accessed by individual participants be recorded and clearly communicated to allow, for
instance, for a clearer cost-benefit assessment of different measures;

·

the approval of final case reports and the final case closure be coupled with the provision of complete beneficiary outcome
information (at an aggregate level).

The committee reiterated its call on the Commission to invite the Parliament, within reasonable deadlines, to the expert group meetings and
seminars in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Framework Agreement on relations between the European Parliament and the
European Commission.
It asked the Commission to include in the mid-term evaluation all aspects regarding cost efficiency of all EGF projects, data on direct
allowance support, as well as suggestions on improving participation of Member States in the EGF and synergies with measures covered by
the ESF or national programmes.
Members also asked Member States and all the institutions involved to make the necessary efforts to further improve procedural and
budgetary arrangements in order to increase the impact of the EGF. They noted, in this regard, that Parliament is currently drafting an
own-initiative report based on the evaluation by the Commission to take stock of the functioning of the EGF Regulation and the cases
examined.
Lastly, the report asked the Member States to highlight more clearly the additionality of EGF funding and its link to other funds, and to consider
the most appropriate ways for the EGF to add value, ensure synergy with other funding sources and avoid displacement and overlaps.

2016/2025(BUD) - 13/04/2016 Budgetary text adopted by Parliament

The European Parliament adopted by 534 votes to 106 with 49 abstentions, a resolution on the proposal for a decision of the European
Parliament and of the Council on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for an amount of EUR 380 000 in
commitment and payment appropriations for technical assistance at the initiative of the Commission (EGF/2016/000 TA 2016).

Mid-term evaluation: Parliament asked the Commission to include in the mid-term evaluation all aspects regarding cost efficiency of all EGF
projects, data on direct allowance support, as well as suggestions on improving participation of Member States in the EGF and synergies with
measures covered by the ESF or national programmes.
Eligibility and added value: Parliament also asked Member States and all the institutions involved to defend the wider use of the derogation for
the eligibility thresholds also favouring SMEs, the extension of the reference periods as well as the possibility to include redundant workers
offering related services to redundant workers of the referent company, thus contributing to a more efficient and valuable use of the EGF. It
asked Member States to highlight more clearly the additionality of EGF funding and its link to other funds, and to consider the most appropriate
ways for the EGF to add value, ensure synergy with other funding sources and avoid displacement and overlaps.
Lastly, it asked Member States and all the institutions involved to make the necessary efforts to further improve procedural and budgetary
arrangements in order to increase the impact of the EGF. The resolution noted, in this regard, that Parliament is currently drafting an
own-initiative report based on the evaluation by the Commission to take stock of the functioning of the EGF Regulation and the cases
examined.

global financial and economic crisis, or as a result of a new global financial and economic crisis, and to assist them with their reintegration into
the labour market.
The EGF is not to exceed a maximum annual amount of EUR 150 million (2011 prices), as laid down in Article 12 of Council Regulation (EU,
Euratom) No 1311/2013.
Regulation (EU) No 1309/2013 provides that a maximum of 0.5 % of the annual maximum amount of the EGF may be used each year for
technical assistance at the initiative of the Commission.
