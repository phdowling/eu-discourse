Summary

2016/2537(RSP) - 04/02/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 478 votes to 81 with 81 abstentions a resolution on the situation in Libya. The resolution was tabled by
the EPP, S&D, ECR, ALDE, and Greens/EFA, groups. Parliament recalled that in February 2011, Libyans took to the streets and ousted the
Gaddafi regime. However, the political vacuum and lack of stable government have been exploited by Daesh, whose ranks include foreigners
and Libyan terrorists who have returned home from fighting in Iraq and Syria. These returnees, accompanied by Jihadists from other countries,
seized the city of Derna to the east of Benghazi in November 2014 and made a pledge of allegiance to Daesh. In the meantime, Daesh has
launched a local campaign of terror with beheadings, shootings and bombings while expanding its territory. The UN-backed Libyan Political
Agreement was signed on 17 December 2015, fully supported by the European Parliament.
Parliament called on the international community, the UN, the EU, the AU and the Arab League member states to stand ready to support
Libyans in their efforts to successfully implement the agreement. It called on regional players to refrain from actions that might exacerbate
divisions and undermine the transition to a stable, inclusive and democratic Libya. Members condemned the destabilising terrorist attacks by
Daesh against the people of Libya, and believed that the EU should use its diplomacy and foreign policy tools, to encourage those countries in
the Middle East and North Africa region to engage positively in the transition process in Libya.
They expressed grave concern at the fate of migrants, asylum seekers and refugees in Libya, whose already unbearable situation continues to
deteriorate. The EU and its Member States were asked to tackle effectively the spiralling migration and refugee flows from North Africa, in
particular from Libya.
Strengthen Libyan transition: the resolution called on the Commission and the European External Action Service, to focus their support on
state-building and institution?building and, together with the Member States, the UN, NATO and regional partners. It endorsed the EU
NAVFOR MED Sophia operation in its efforts to tackle the migration crisis and the smugglers who exploit migrants. Parliament appreciated
that the EU has already made available a 100-million-euro package and is ready to offer immediate support in areas that will be prioritised
together with the new Libyan GNA once formed. It called on the Member States not to act individually but to support the VP/HR in the
formulation of a comprehensive strategy to support the transition and the new Libyan Government.
Members believed that reforms of the security sector and disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration programmes are a priority for the
country. They stressed the importance of the international community increasing humanitarian funding to meet the most urgent needs of the
people who have been severely affected by the conflict in Libya. Parliament underlined the need to provide funds to help humanitarian
organisations to better assess the situation and improve their response to needs on the ground, and they called on the Member States to fulfil
their commitments to the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa.
