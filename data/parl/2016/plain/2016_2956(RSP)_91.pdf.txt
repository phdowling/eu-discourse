Summary

2016/2956(RSP) - 27/10/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 488 votes to 11, with 128 abstentions, a resolution on the on the situation in Northern Iraq and Mosul.
The text adopted in plenary was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ECR, ALDE, GUE/NGL and EFDD groups.
Members strongly supported the operation started by Iraq to liberate Mosul from ISIS/Daesh and firmly condemned the ongoing violence and
mass executions by ISIS/Daesh in Iraq. They reaffirmed their full support for Iraqs independence, territorial integrity and sovereignty, while
stressing the importance of fostering dialogue between Iraq and the countries in the region with the aim of building a more secure Middle East.
Parliament underlined that the right of return to their ancestral homeland for the displaced indigenous peoples of the Nineveh Plain, Tal Afar
and Sinjar should be a policy priority of the Iraqi Government supported by the EU. It recalled that the indigenous communities of the Nineveh
Plain, Tal Afar and Sinjar Christians (Chaldeans/Syriacs/Assyrians), Yazidis, Turkmens and others have a right to safety, security and
regional autonomy within the federal structure of the Republic of Iraq.
The resolution called on all parties to the conflict to abide by international humanitarian law during and after hostilities and to open
humanitarian corridors in order to allow and help civilians to flee the conflict, to avoid civilians remaining trapped in Mosul and being used by
ISIS/Daesh as human shields.
All the actors fighting ISIS/Daesh should develop sustainable, long-term and inclusive political cooperation and dialogue in order to provide the
foundation for an Iraq free of radical and extremist movements.
Parliament called on the EU, its Members States and the international community to:
work with the national and regional governments of the Republic of Iraq towards a sustainable security settlement in the Nineveh
Plain, Tal Afar and Sinjar;
work with the national and regional governments oversee the reintegration of all the Iraqis and ethnic and religious minorities who
have been displaced;
give their practical and diplomatic support to a sustainable and inclusive post-conflict structure for the region;
offer technical assistance to the Government of Iraq in implementing the decision to create a Nineveh Plain Province, and supporting
the new provincial administrations to attain their full potential.
Members stressed the vital importance of timely and effective provision of safety, through genuine safe routes where protection can be
sustained, including through de-mining, and basic services, such as healthcare, electricity and education, in the liberated areas. They
underlined the importance of Mosul for the whole of Iraq and calls for the representation of minorities in a new Mosul administration.
Lastly, Parliament emphasised the need to continue to fight the further spread in the region and beyond of Islamist-jihadist ideologies , notably
Salafi jihadism. It called on the EU Member States to push for referral to the International Criminal Court of genocide, war crimes and crimes
against humanity committed in Iraq, Syria, Libya and elsewhere by ISIS/Daesh.
The Iraq-led military coalition was asked to take all the necessary measures to preserve the evidence of the war crimes and crimes against
humanity committed by ISIS/Daesh in order to ensure accountability.
