Summary

2016/2814(RSP) - 06/10/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 467 votes to 94 with 55 abstentions, a resolution on the implementation of the Paris Agreement and the
2016 UN Climate Change Conference (COP22) which will take place in Marrakesh, Morocco.
The resolution was tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
Recalling that according to scientific evidence, warming of the climate system is unequivocal, Parliament took note of the UNFCCC secretariat
conclusions that continuing with current levels of global GHG emissions will consume, within the next 5 years, the remaining carbon budget
consistent with limiting the rise in global average temperature to no more than 1.5°C. Members stressed that all countries should accelerate
the transition to net zero GHG emissions and climate resilience. They urged developed countries, especially the EU, to drastically reduce their
GHG emissions beyond current pledges.
Ratifying and implementing the Paris Agreement: Parliament urged early entry into force of the Paris Agreement and called on the
Commission and the Member States to ensure early and swift ratification. The Commission was asked to report regularly to Parliament on the
stages reached in the ratification process.
Members regretted that the sum of all the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) does not bring the world even close to the
2°C target. They pointed out that additional ambition is necessary and called for concerted action by the EU and other major emitters to bring
their INDCs closer to the 2°C target.
The resolution emphasised the critical importance of all Parties, including the EU, raising their emission reductions commitments in their NDCs
every five years. The EU was called upon to commit to further emission reductions in its NDC for 2030.
Parliament also recalled that global emissions of carbon dioxide should be phased out by 2050 or shortly thereafter. It called on all parties in a
position to do so to implement their national decarbonisation targets and strategies by prioritising the phasing-out of emissions from coal,
which is the most polluting source of energy.
COP22 in Marrakesh: Members believed that negotiations should advance on the key elements of the Paris Agreement, including an
enhanced transparency framework, further guidance on INDCs, climate finance and capacity support, inclusive multi-level governance, as well
as a mechanism to facilitate implementation and promote compliance. They emphasised the need to start discussions on the shape of the
2018 facilitative dialogue, which would be a key opportunity to close the persistent mitigation gap given the current INDCs.
Comprehensive effort by all sectors: Parliament stressed the need to:
strengthen EU action and international cooperation in order to better estimate and optimise the carbon capture potential of land
emissions and ensure safe and durable CO2 sequestration;
enhance the adaptive capacities and resilience of forests to climate change and for mitigation efforts focused on the tropical forest
sector (REDD+);
put a range of policies in place aimed at lowering emissions from the aviation and shipping sector; Members called on all the Parties to
work through the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) to develop a
global policy framework that enables an effective response, and to take measures to set adequate targets before the end of 2016;
properly address the transition towards a global circular economy model.
Parliament asked that strong efforts be made to keep any Member State with a changing status in the EU Emission Trading System (ETS).
Members also:

called for the adoption of an ambitious global hydro fluorocarbons (HFCs) phase-down in 2016;
underlined the fact that combatting climate change is the priority and should be pursued worldwide while ensuring energy security and
the development of sustainable economic growth and jobs;
called on the EU to push the international community to adopt without delay concrete measures, including a timetable, for
progressively phasing out environmentally or economically harmful subsidies, including for fossil fuels;
underlined the fact that research and innovation into resource-efficient and low-emission technologies is key to fighting climate change
in a cost-effective way, and recalled the catalytic role digital technologies can play in the transformation of the energy system.
Climate resilience through adaptation: Members called for long-term adaptation objectives to be set, and invited the Commission to propose a
legally binding instrument if the action being taken in the Member States is deemed insufficient.
Noting with concern that 166 million people were forced to leave their homes because of floods, windstorms, earthquakes or other disasters
between 2008 and 201, Parliament called for serious recognition of the issue of climate refugees, and the scope thereof, resulting from climate
disasters caused by global warming. It also drew attention to the fact that climate-related developments in parts of Africa and the Middle East
could contribute to political instability, economic hardship and an escalation of the refugee crisis in the Mediterranean.
Members emphasised the importance of the role developing countries also play in attaining the objectives of the Paris Agreement and the
need to help those countries implement their climate plans.
Climate finance: further efforts are necessary to ensure the mobilisation of climate finance to meet the USD 100 billion goal by 2020. Members
called for concrete EU and international commitments to deliver additional sources of climate finance, including by; (i) introducing a financial
transactions tax, (ii) setting aside some EU ETS emission allowances in the 2021-2030 period and (iii) allocating revenue from EU and
international measures on aviation and shipping emissions.
Lastly, Parliament welcomed the EUs continued focus on climate diplomacy, and committed itself to ratification of the Paris Agreement as
soon as possible and to using its international role to seek progress towards the quick ratification and implementation of the Paris Agreement.
