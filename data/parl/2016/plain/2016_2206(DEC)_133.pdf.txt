2016/2206(DEC) - 31/03/2017 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Inés AYALA SENDER (S&D, ES) on discharge in respect of the implementation of
the budget of the European Union agencies for the financial year 2015: performance, financial management and control.
Members emphasised that the agencies have significant influence on policy and decision-making and programme implementation in areas of
vital importance to European citizens, such as health, the environment, human and social rights, migration, refugees, innovation, financial
supervision, safety and security.
They insisted on the essential role that agencies have in enhancing the visibility of the Union in the Member States.
On a budgetary level, Members recalled that the agencies 2015 budget amounted to some EUR 2.8 billion, representing an increase of about
7.7 % compared to 2014 and about 2 % of the Unions general budget. The major part of the agencies budget is funded through Commission
subsidies, whereas the rest is income from fees or other sources which amount to almost one-third. They noted with concern that Union
regulatory agencies in charge of the risk assessment of regulated products, in particular the European Food Safety Authority, the European
Chemicals Agency or the European Medicines Agency do not have the financial and legal resources to fulfil their mission properly.
Common approach and the Commissions Roadmap: Members stated that most of the Roadmap actions implemented by the agencies helped
to improve their accountability and transparency, which further demonstrates the considerable efforts taken by the agencies to implement the
Common Approach, despite the pressure in terms of resources, and showed that agencies are responsible, accountable and transparent.
They noted with concern that the implementation of the actions had in addition a generally negative impact on the agencies efficiency, as well
as that in certain areas the implementation resulted in significant increases in costs.
Budget and financial management: Members recalled that an elevated level of carry-overs of committed appropriations remains the most
frequent issue of the budgetary and financial management affecting 32 agencies, compared with 28 in 2014. They noted that carry-overs may
often be partly or fully justified by the multiannual nature of the agencies operational programmes and do not necessarily indicate weaknesses
in budget planning and implementation, nor are they always at odds with the budgetary principle of annuality.
Cooperation between agencies: Members highlighted the benefits of sharing services, which enable consistent application of administrative
implementing rules and procedures that concern human resources and finance issues. They stated that some agencies continue to have dual
operational and administrative headquarters. It is essential that all dual headquarters which do not offer any operational added value should be
done away with at the earliest opportunity.
They emphasised the importance of cooperation and exchange of ideas and practices between the agencies within the framework of the Union
agencies performance development network, which contributes to more balanced governance and greater coherence between them.
Human resources management: Members are concerned that the Commission applied an additional levy of 5 % of staff to the agencies in
order to create a redeployment pool from which it would allocate the posts to the agencies with new tasks entrusted to them or in a start-up
phase. They are particularly concerned that with the additional staff reduction, fulfilment of the agencies mandates and annual work
programmes proves increasingly difficult.
Conflicts of interest and transparency: Members noted that all agencies already adopted generic rules on whistleblowing as part of the ethics
guidelines. They noted with concern however, that only 65 % of the agencies adopted additional internal rules on whistleblowing. They called
on the agencies which have still not adopted the internal whistleblowing rules to do so without delay. They encouraged the agencies to further
strengthen their visibility and to continue to develop various communication channels that would present their work and activities to wide
public.
Other comments: Members acknowledged the high number of agencies which have been set up in the area of freedom, security and justice
but reiterates the importance of the missions which they carry out and their direct impact on citizens' lives. They stressed that all agencies
have been set up in response to a specific needs and created European added value.
Lastly, Members requested that all justice and home affairs agencies identify financial, resource or other bottlenecks hindering their
operational performance.

2016/2206(DEC) - 27/04/2017 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 506 votes to 98 with 27 abstentions, a resolution on discharge in respect of the implementation of the
budget of the European Union agencies for the financial year 2015: performance, financial management and control.
Parliament emphasised that the agencies have significant influence on policy and decision-making and programme implementation in areas of
vital importance to European citizens, such as health, the environment, human and social rights, migration, refugees, innovation, financial
supervision, safety and security.

It insisted on the essential role that agencies have in enhancing the visibility of the Union in the Member States.
On a budgetary level, Parliament recalled that the agencies 2015 budget amounted to some EUR 2.8 billion, representing an increase of about
7.7 % compared to 2014 and about 2 % of the Unions general budget. The major part of the Agencys budget is funded through Commission
subsidies, whereas the rest is income from fees or other sources which amount to almost one-third. It noted with concern that Union regulatory
agencies in charge of the risk assessment of regulated products, in particular the European Food Safety Authority, the European Chemicals

transparent. It noted with concern that the implementation of the actions had in addition a generally negative impact on the agencies efficiency,
as well as that in certain areas the implementation resulted in significant increases in costs. Parliament also acknowledged the administrative
burden that the implementation of the Roadmap has caused to the agencies, as well as the outsourcing of several tasks related to collecting
and consolidating agencies data and input to the Network, in particular with regard to the budgetary and discharge procedure. The
Commission and the budgetary authority are called upon to recognise these efforts, and to provide additional resources in the establishment
plan of the agencies.
Budget and financial management: Parliament recalled that an elevated level of carry-overs of committed appropriations remains the most
frequent issue of the budgetary and financial management affecting 32 agencies, compared with 28 in 2014. It noted that carry-overs may
often be partly or fully justified by the multiannual nature of the agencies operational programmes and do not necessarily indicate weaknesses

guidelines. It noted with concern however, that only 65 % of the agencies adopted additional internal rules on whistleblowing. It called on the
agencies which have still not adopted the internal whistleblowing rules to do so without delay.
Communication and visibility: Parliament noted that the agencies are actively promoting their work through various channels, in particular by
regularly updating their websites to provide information and promote the work delivered as well as open-days to provide citizens with
opportunities to learn more about the work of the agencies and the Union institutions.
Other comments: Parliament acknowledged the high number of agencies which have been set up in the area of freedom, security and justice
but reiterates the importance of the missions which they carry out and their direct impact on citizens' lives. It stressed that all agencies have
been set up in response to a specific needs and created European added value.
