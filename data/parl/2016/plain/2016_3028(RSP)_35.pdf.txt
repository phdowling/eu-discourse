Summary

2016/3028(RSP) - 15/12/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a resolution on the on mass graves in Iraq.
The text adopted in plenary was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ECR, ALDE, GUE/NGL, Greens/EFA and EFDD groups.
Members condemned without reservation the continuing atrocities and flagrant violations of international humanitarian and human rights law
committed by ISIS/Daesh. They noted with overwhelming dismay the ongoing discoveries of new mass graves in Iraq and Syria, which are
evidence of the terror committed by ISIS/Daesh.
They called on the Iraqi authorities, including the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG), to take urgent steps to protect the gravesites around
Mount Sinjar and to take all other necessary measures to preserve the evidence of the war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by
ISIS/Daesh, in order to ensure accountability.
They called for the European Union, its Member States and other potential international donors to facilitate and lend their full support to the
Government of Iraq in setting up the human resources and infrastructure needed for the preservation and analysis of evidence that could be
vital to future domestic and international accountability processes.
They are particularly alarmed by the situation of women and children in the conflict, in particular the Yazidi women and children who are
victims of persecution, executions, torture, sexual exploitation and other atrocities.
Members expressed their support for the Republic of Iraq and its people and stressed that the right to return to their ancestral homeland for the
displaced indigenous peoples of the Nineveh Plain, Tal Afar and Sinjar many of whom are displaced within Iraq should be a policy priority of
the Iraqi Government.
Members called on the international community, including the EU Member States, to bring to justice ISIS/Daesh members within their
jurisdiction, including by applying the principle of universal jurisdiction.
