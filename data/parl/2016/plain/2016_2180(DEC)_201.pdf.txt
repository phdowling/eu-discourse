2016/2180(DEC) - 11/07/2016 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: presentation by the Commission of the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2015, as part of
the 2015 discharge procedure.
Analysis of the accounts of the European Global Navigation Satellite System Agency (GSA).
CONTENT: the organisational governance of the EU consists of institutions, agencies and other EU bodies whose expenditure is included in
the general budget of the Union.
The EU's operational expenditure of these institutions takes different forms, depending on how the money is paid out and managed.
From 2014 onwards, the Commission classifies its expenditure as follows:
Direct management: the budget is implemented directly by the Commission services.
Indirect management: the Commission confers tasks of implementation of the budget to bodies of EU law or national law, such as the
EU agencies.
Shared management: under this method of budget implementation tasks are delegated to Member States. About 80 % of the
expenditure falls under this management mode covering such areas as agricultural spending and structural actions.
This Commission document concerns the EU's consolidated accounts for the year 2015 and details how spending by the EU institutions and
bodies was carried out. The consolidated annual accounts of the EU provide financial information on the activities of the institutions, agencies
and other bodies of the EU from an accrual accounting and budgetary perspective.
It is the responsibility of the Commission's Accounting Officer to prepare the EU's consolidated annual accounts and ensure that they present
fairly, in all material aspects, the financial position, the result of the operations and the cash flows of the EU institutions and bodies, including
the European Global Navigation Satellite System Agency (GSA), with a view to granting discharge.
Discharge procedure: the final step of a budget lifecycle is the discharge of the budget for a given financial year. It represents the political
aspect of the external control of budget implementation and is the decision by which the European Parliament, acting on a Council
recommendation, "releases" the Commission (and other EU bodies) from its responsibility for management of a given budget by marking the

end of that budget's existence. The European Parliament is the discharge authority within the EU.
The discharge procedure may produce three outcomes: (i) the granting; (ii) postponement or; (iii) the refusal of the discharge.
The final discharge report including specific recommendations to the Commission for action is adopted in plenary by the European Parliament
and are subject to an annual follow up report in which the Commission outlines the concrete actions it has taken to implement the
recommendations made.
Each agency is subject to its own discharge procedure, including the European Global Navigation Satellite System Agency (GSA).
GSA: the Supervisory Authority, whose headquarters are located in Prague (CZ) since 2012, was set up by Council Regulation (EC) No
1321/2004 and its main task is to manage the public interests relating to the European GNSS programmes and to act as the regulatory
authority for the programme during the deployment and operational phases of the Galileo Programme. Regulation (EC) No 683/2008 of the
European Parliament and the Council reduced the responsibilities of the Authority to the control of the security of Galileo systems and to the
preparation of their commercialisation.
As regards the Authoritys accounts, these are presented in detail in the document on the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union
for 2015:
Commitment appropriations:
-

committed: EUR 1 582 million;

-

paid: EUR 144 million;

-

carried-over: EUR 1 438 million.

Payment appropriations:
-

committed: EUR 616 million;

-

paid: EUR 211 million;

-

carried-over: EUR 404 million.

For further details on expenditure, please refer to the final accounts of the GSA.

2016/2180(DEC) - 13/09/2016 Court of Auditors: opinion, report
PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the European GNSS Agency for the year 2015, together
with the Agencys replies.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit focused on the annual accounts of the European GNSS Agency (GSA). The GSA officially took over all tasks previously assigned to
the GALILEO Joint Undertaking. The Commission entrusted the exploitation of the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service
(EGNOS) to the Agency through a delegation agreement.
Statement of assurance: pursuant to the provisions of Article 287 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the Court
has audited:
the annual accounts of the Agency, which comprise the financial statements and the reports on the implementation of the budget for
the financial year ended 31 December 2015, and
the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying those accounts.
Opinion on the reliability of the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the Agencys annual accounts present fairly, in all material respects, its
financial position as at 31 December 2015 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the
provisions of its Financial Regulation and the accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer. A comment was made by the
Court as regards the last validation of the accounting systems which was performed in 2012. The new accountant plans to perform the next
validation in 2020.
Opinion on the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the accounts: in the Courts opinion, the transactions underlying the annual
accounts for the year ended 31 December 2015 are legal and regular in all material respects.
The report made a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of the Agency, accompanied by the latters response.
The main observations may be summarised as follows:
The Courts observations:
budgetary management: the Court stated that the Agencys audited budgetary implementation report differs from the level of detail
provided by most other agencies. It stated that the level of carry-overs for committed appropriations was high for administrative
expenditure at EUR 2.5 million which mainly related to services provided in 2015 for which invoices were not received until 2016;
planning: the Agencys 2015 annual work programme was only adopted in March 2015 and the adoption of its 2014-2020 multi-annual
work programme is outstanding. This puts the achievement of the Agencys objectives at risk.
The Agencys reply:
budgetary management: the Agency stated that based on an agreement signed with the Commission, the Agencys accounts and
related reports have been prepared by the Commissions accountant. It has made significant efforts to reduce the traditionally high

level of carry-overs. Due to the quarterly nature of invoicing of several large contracts, certain high-value invoices relating to 2015
services were only received in 2016. The high level of carry-over therefore allowed forward-looking reprioritisation, while avoiding
cancellations;
planning: the Agency observed that all steps at GSA level related to annual work programme preparation and submission were
completed timely. Therefore, the GSA continues to work closely with the Commission as a key stakeholder to ensuring the timely
adoption of future annual work programmes and the multi-annual work programmes.
Lastly, the Court of Auditors report also contained a summary of the Agencys key figures in 2015:
Budget: EUR 363 million (payment appropriations).
Staff: 139 including officials, temporary and contract staff and seconded national experts.

2016/2180(DEC) - 07/02/2017 Supplementary non-legislative basic document
Having examined the revenue and expenditure accounts for the financial year 2015 and the balance sheet as at 31 December 2015 of the
European GNSS Agency (GSA), as well as the Court of Auditors' report on the annual accounts of the Agency for the financial year 2015,
accompanied by the Agency's replies to the Court's observations, the Council recommended the European Parliament to give a discharge to
the Executive Director of the Agency in respect of the implementation of the budget for the financial year 2015.
The Council welcomed the Court's opinion that, in all material respects, the Agency's annual accounts present fairly its financial position as at
31 December 2015 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions of the
Agency's Financial Regulation, and that the underlying transactions for 2015 are legal and regular in all material respects.
Nevertheless, various observations were made as regards:
accounting systems: the Council called on the Agency to take the necessary action in order to ensure that the validation of its
accounting systems is performed in due time;
budgetary implementation: the Agency is called upon to complete its business continuity plans and to revise the level of detail included
in its budgetary implementation reports;
financial programming: the Council noted that a high level of commitment appropriations was carried over to 2016. It called on the
Agency to improve its financial programming and monitoring of the budget implementation, in order to reduce the level of
commitments carried over to the following financial year to the minimum strictly necessary;
staff turnover: the Council encouraged the Agency to pursue its efforts to reduce the level of staff turnover in order to ensure efficiency
and continuity in the Agency's work.

2016/2180(DEC) - 31/03/2017 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Inés AYALA SENDER (S&D, ES) on discharge in respect of the implementation of
the budget of the European GNSS Agency for the financial year 2015.
The committee called on the European Parliament to grant the Executive Director of the Agency discharge in respect of the implementation of
the agencys budget for the financial year 2015.
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it had obtained reasonable assurance that the annual accounts of the Agency for the financial year
2015 were reliable and that the underlying transactions were legal and regular, Members called on Parliament to approve the closure of the
Agencys accounts. They made, however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is granted,
in addition to the general recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU
agencies:
Agencys financial statements: Members noted that the Union subsidy to the final budget of the European GNSS Agency for the
financial year 2015 was EUR 27 606 414, representing an increase of 8.82 % compared to 2014.
Reliability of the accounts: Members noted that the move of the Agency to Prague did not result in any changes in the financial
circuits, processes and information flow.
Budget and financial management: Members noted that the Agency managed a large amount of delegated budget in 2015 following
the signature of three new delegation agreements (EGNOS Exploitation, Galileo Exploitation and Horizon 2020) with the Commission
in the course of 2014. They observed that an amendment to the Galileo Exploitation delegation agreement was signed in December
2015, assigning a further EUR 300 million to the Agency. A total of EUR 116 067 789 delegated budget was committed in 2015 and
EUR 183 108 199 made in payments.
Members also made a series of observations regarding transfers, commitment and carry-overs, the prevention and management of conflicts of
interests, procurement and recruitment procedures and internal audits and controls.
Lastly, Members noted that the Agency is a main partner in, and the initiator of, the European Space Expo project that visited Luxembourg,
Milan, Oslo, Zagreb, Stockholm, Riga, Ljubljana and Athens in 2015, and welcomed hundreds of thousands of local citizens. Each Expo visit
was the result of collaboration with many local actors including local industry, municipalities and academia/
They noted that the Agencys 2015 annual work programme was adopted only in March 2015 and that the adoption of its 2014 to 2020
multi-annual work programme (MAWP) is outstanding. The late adoption of key planning documents puts the achievement of the Agencys
objectives at risk. Members acknowledged that, following the development of further versions of the MAWP and in discussion with the
Commission, it was finally decided to include the MAWP as part of the single programming document relating to the period 2017 to 2020.

2016/2180(DEC) - 20/04/2017 Final act

PURPOSE: to grant discharge to the European GNSS Agency (GSA) in respect of the Agencys budget for the financial year 2015.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision (EU) 2017/1726 of the European Parliament on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of
the European GNSS Agency for the financial year 2015.
CONTENT: with the present decision, the European Parliament grants discharge to the Executive Director of the European GNSS Agency for
the implementation of its budget for the financial year 2015.
This decision is in line with the European Parliament's resolution adopted on 27 April 2017 and comprises a series of observations that form
an integral part of the discharge decision (please refer to the summary of the opinion of 27 April 2017).
Amongst Parliaments main observations in the resolution accompanying the discharge decision, it called on the Agency to adopt an internal
whistleblowing policy in order to foster a culture of transparency and accountability in the workplace.
Parliament noted with satisfaction that in 2015 the Agency overhauled its website, including updating the content, an analysis of user needs
and experience, a benchmarking exercise and restructuring of its information architecture.

2016/2180(DEC) - 27/04/2017 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament decided to grant discharge to the Executive Director of the European GNSS Agency in respect of the
implementation of its budget for the financial year 2015.
The vote on the decision on discharge covers the closure of the accounts (in accordance with Annex IV, Article 5 (1) (a) to Parliaments Rules
of Procedure).
Noting that the Court of Auditors has stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the Agencys annual accounts for the financial year
2015 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Parliament adopted by 501 votes to 104 with 12 abstentions, a
resolution containing a series of recommendations, which form an integral part of the decision on discharge and which add to the general
recommendations set out in the resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies.
These recommendations may be summarised as follows:
Agencys financial statements: Parliament noted that the Union subsidy to the final budget of the European GNSS Agency for the
financial year 2015 was EUR 27 606 414, representing an increase of 8.82 % compared to 2014.
Reliability of the accounts: It noted that, according to the Courts report, the latest validation of the accounting systems was performed
in 2012. Since the last local system validation, there have been no changes to local systems and that the move of the Agency to
Prague did not result in any changes in the financial circuits, processes and information flow. It observed that the local systems were
presented to the Agencys new accountant prior to acceptance of its mission. Although it acknowledged that the risk is currently
assessed to be low, Parliament stated that the next validation will be carried out in 2020, or, if there are changes to the systems, in
2018.
Budget and financial management: Parliament noted that the Agency managed a large amount of delegated budget in 2015 following
the signature of three new delegation agreements (EGNOS Exploitation, Galileo Exploitation and Horizon 2020) with the Commission
in the course of 2014. It observed that an amendment to the Galileo Exploitation delegation agreement was signed in December 2015,
assigning a further EUR 300 million to the Agency . A total of EUR 116 067 789 delegated budget was committed in 2015 and
EUR 183 108 199 made in payments.
Parliament made a series of observations regarding transfers, commitment and carry-overs, the prevention and management of conflicts of
interests, procurement and recruitment procedures and internal audits and controls.
Communication: Parliament noted that the Agency is a main partner in, and the initiator of, the European Space Expo project that visited
Luxembourg, Milan, Oslo, Zagreb, Stockholm, Riga, Ljubljana and Athens in 2015, and welcomed hundreds of thousands of local citizens.
Each Expo visit was the result of collaboration with many local actors including local industry, municipalities and academia.
It noted that the Agencys 2015 annual work programme was adopted only in March 2015 and that the adoption of its 2014 to 2020
multi-annual work programme (MAWP) is outstanding. The late adoption of key planning documents puts the achievement of the Agencys
objectives at risk. It acknowledged that, following the development of further versions of the MAWP and in discussion with the Commission, it
was finally decided to include the MAWP as part of the single programming document relating to the period 2017 to 2020.
