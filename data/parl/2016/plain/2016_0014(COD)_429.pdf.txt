2016/0014(COD) - 27/01/2016 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to revise the legal framework for the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers in order to ensure the proper functioning of
the internal market while at the same time providing for a high level of public safety and environmental protection.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: a comprehensive EU type-approval framework for motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and
separate technical units intended for such vehicles, was established by Directive 2007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council.
This framework aims at facilitating the free movement of motor vehicles and trailers in the internal market by laying down harmonised
requirements designed to achieve common environmental and safety objectives. Directive 2007/46/EC covers motor vehicles for the carriage
of passengers (category M) and of goods (category N), and their trailers (category O), as well as their systems and components.
As part of the commitments the Commission made in its CARS2020 Action Plan for a strong, competitive and sustainable European car
industry, the EU type-approval framework for motor vehicles has been the subject of a comprehensive fitness check in 2013.
Although the fitness check confirmed that the existing regulatory framework has its merits in meeting policy objectives, it has come under
harsh criticism after the discovery that a German manufacturer (VW) had for several years used software to manipulate the emission
performance of its cars.
Within a week of the outbreak of the scandal, the Commission announced that it would reinforce the type-approval system, in particular by
ensuring adequate supervisory mechanisms to ensure a correct and harmonised application of the type-approval procedures.
Triggered by the outburst of the VW emissions scandal, the European Parliament adopted on 27 October 2015 a Resolution on emission
measurements in the automotive sector, calling on the Commission for significantly strengthening the current EU type approval regime
including more EU oversight, in particular with regard to market surveillance, coordination and follow up regime for vehicles sold in the Union.
IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the proposal is accompanied by an impact assessment of the VW emissions crisis on the review of the type-approval
framework for motor vehicle.
Already before the outburst of the VW crisis, the Commission was working on proposals to improve the type-approval legislation for motor
vehicles, and identified main areas with a significant potential for improvement to better address the problems of unsafe and non-compliant
automotive products. The assessment of the possible policy options resulted in the conclusion that regulatory action in these areas would be
the most effective.
The re-assessment of these policy options in the light of the VW crisis has highlighted the need to further increase their effectiveness in terms
of detecting and preventing non-compliance problems.
There is a warranted need for EU wide supervision to achieve a harmonised and co-ordinated enforcement based on commonly applicable
criteria and uniformly applied by Member States.
CONTENT: the proposed Regulation seeks to replace Directive 2007/46/EC. It sets out the harmonised rules and principles for the
type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles, and the
individual vehicle approval.
The proposal aims to strengthen the existing type-approval framework, by introducing market surveillance provisions. It also contains a wide
range of measures relating to:
the traceability of products and role and responsibilities of economic operators in the supply chain;
responsibilities of and co-operation between the different national authorities involved in the enforcement of the technical
harmonisation legislation for motor vehicles;
the quality of the type-approval and conformity assessment tasks carried out by technical services;
the post-market safeguard procedures and the provisions for the recall of vehicles,
procedures for ensuring conformity of production.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the budgetary implication of this proposal is estimated at EUR 40.104 million (including administrative

expenditure) for the period 2017-2020.
In view of the constraints of the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020, the implementation of the legislative proposal will have to be built
on existing resources and to be designed in such a manner that additional financial resources under the EU budget are not needed. For the
period following 31 December 2020, the amount shall be subject to the multiannual financial framework in force for the period commencing in
2021.
DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of
the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

2016/0014(COD) - 01/03/2017 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection adopted the report by Daniel DALTON (ECR, UK) on the proposal for a
regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the approval and market surveillance of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of
systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles.
The committee recommended that the European Parliaments position adopted at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure
should amend the Commission proposal as follows:
An end to manipulation: Members stated that consumer protection is a priority of the Union and that everything should be done to prevent
cheating by car manufacturers designed to manipulate pollution emission and fuel consumption tests in order to produce false results or
circumvent any other rules.
Responsibility of type-approval authorities and competent authorities: the proposed amendments aim to clarify the roles and responsibilities of
national type approval authorities, testing centres and market surveillance bodies, in order to reinforce their independence and prevent
conflicts of interest.
Members proposed the following:
Member States shall assess at least every three years the functioning of their type-approval activities and the quality of the
type-approvals issued. They shall perform random market surveillance tests on at least 20 % of the new models placed on the Union
market each year to verify whether the vehicles on the road comply with Union safety and environmental legislation;
the approval authorities shall interpret and enforce the requirements of this Regulation in a uniform and consistent manner to avoid
divergent standards being applied across the Union;
Market surveillance authorities shall (i) perform regular checks to verify compliance with the requirements set out in this Regulation as
well as with the correctness of the type approvals; (ii) prepare and submit a national market surveillance programme for approval by
the Commission on an annual or multi-annual basis; (iii) to alert users within their territories within an adequate timeframe of
non-compliance they have identified.
Members proposed making publicly available the results of the national periodic reviews on the functioning of their surveillance activities. The
Commission shall be empowered to supervise the work of the national authorities by means of regular audits, checks and tests of samples of
the type-approvals issued and verifying the uniform, consistent and effective application of this Regulation.
Compliance verification testing by the Commission: the European Commission may oblige a Member State to carry out a compliance test
which it considers necessary, or do the tests itself under certain conditions.
The European Commission may also oblige economic operators to take all necessary restrictive measures, including the recall of vehicles, so
that non-compliant vehicles in question are brought into conformity.
Manufacturers responsibility: the manufacturer shall be responsible to the approval authority for all aspects of the approval procedure and for
ensuring conformity of production regardless of testing method used.
The manufacturer shall: (i) ensure that the design of the vehicles does not incorporate strategies that unnecessarily alter the performance
exhibited during applicable test procedures when those vehicles are operated under conditions that might reasonably be expected to be
encountered in normal operation and use; (ii) disclose any engine management strategies which might be deployed, either through hardware
or software means.
Forum for enforcement: Members proposed strengthening the Forums powers. Its tasks shall be extended to: (i) the consideration of
substantiated complaints, evidence or other relevant information presented by recognised third parties of possible non-compliance; (ii) the joint
discussion and assessment of the national market surveillance programmes following their submission to the Commission; (iii) the review of
the results of assessments of the functioning of market surveillance.
Fees: Members proposed that the costs for their type-approval and market surveillance activities shall be covered by the Member States either
through their national budgets, a fee-based structure (where national fees are levied on the manufacturers who have applied for type-approval
in the Member State concerned), or apply a combination of both methods.
Penalties: the proposal provides that the Commission may impose administrative fines (of up to EUR 30 000 per vehicle) on the manufacturer
concerned in breach of the Regulation. Administrative fines levied by the Commissions may be used for the purposes of market surveillance
measures and for measures to support persons negatively affected by infringements of this Regulation or other such activities to the benefit of
affected consumers and, where appropriate, environmental protection.
Database: Members proposed that the Commission should establish an online type-approval database for the secure electronic exchange of
information related to type-approval procedures, authorisations issued and market surveillance.

2016/0014(COD) - 04/04/2017 Text adopted by Parliament, partial vote at 1st reading/single
reading

The European Parliament adopted by 585 votes to 77, with 19 abstentions, amendments on the proposal for a regulation of the European
Parliament and of the Council on the approval and market surveillance of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and
separate technical units intended for such vehicles.
The matter was referred back to the committee responsible for interinstitutional negotiations.
The main amendments adopted in plenary concern the following issues:
An end to manipulation: Members stated that consumer protection is a priority of the Union and that everything should be done to prevent
cheating by car manufacturers designed to manipulate pollution emission and fuel consumption tests in order to produce false results or
circumvent any other rules. Particular attention should be paid to the risk of illegal defeat devices.
This Regulation should ensure reliable, harmonised and transparent type-approval and market surveillance procedures in the Member States.
As consumer protection is a priority of the Union, manufacturers of vehicles circulating in the Union should be required to submit those
vehicles for testing before being placed on the market and during their lifetime. Member States and the Commission should be guarantors of
this double surveillance, the one being able to act where the other fails to do so.
Responsibility of type-approval authorities and competent authorities: the proposed amendments aim to clarify the roles and responsibilities of
national type approval authorities, testing centres and market surveillance bodies, in order to reinforce their independence and prevent
conflicts of interest.
Members proposed the following:
Member States shall assess at least every three years the functioning of their type-approval activities and the quality of the
type-approvals issued. They shall perform random market surveillance tests on at least 20 % of the new models placed on the Union
market each year to verify whether the vehicles on the road comply with Union safety and environmental legislation;
the approval authorities shall interpret and enforce the requirements of this Regulation in a uniform and consistent manner to avoid
divergent standards being applied across the Union;
Market surveillance authorities shall (i) perform regular checks to verify compliance with the requirements set out in this Regulation as
well as with the correctness of the type approvals; (ii) prepare and submit a national market surveillance programme for approval by
the Commission on an annual or multi-annual basis; (iii) to alert users within their territories within an adequate timeframe of
non-compliance they have identified; (iv) inform, without delay, the Commission and the Member States where it considered that a
vehicle is in breach of the Regulation.
Members proposed making publicly available the results of the national periodic reviews on the functioning of their surveillance activities.
The Commission shall be empowered to supervise the work of the national authorities by means of regular audits, checks and tests of
samples of the type-approvals issued and verifying the uniform, consistent and effective application of this Regulation.
Compliance verification testing by the Commission: the European Commission may:
oblige a Member State to carry out a compliance test which it considers necessary, or do the tests itself under certain conditions;
oblige economic operators to take all necessary restrictive measures, including the recall of vehicles, so that non-compliant vehicles in
question are brought into conformity.
Those tests and inspections shall be performed by means of, inter alia, laboratory tests and real-driving emissions tests, on the basis of
statistically relevant samples, and shall be supplemented by documentary checks.
Where technical services are designated for the purposes of this Article, the Commission shall ensure that a different technical service is used
from the technical service that performed the original type approval test.
Manufacturers responsibility: the manufacturer shall be responsible to the approval authority for all aspects of the approval procedure and for
ensuring conformity of production regardless of testing method used.
The manufacturer shall: (i) ensure that the design of the vehicles does not incorporate strategies that unnecessarily alter the performance
exhibited during applicable test procedures when those vehicles are operated under conditions that might reasonably be expected to be
encountered in normal operation and use; (ii) disclose any engine management strategies which might be deployed, either through hardware
or software means; (iii) investigate and keep a register of complaints and non-conformities of vehicles, systems, components, separate
technical units, parts or equipment that he placed on the market and keep his importers and distributors informed of such monitoring. If the
number of complaints and non- conformities concerning safety or emission related equipment exceed 30 cases or 1 per cent of the total of
vehicles, detailed information shall be sent to the relevant approval authority responsible.
Forum for enforcement: Members proposed strengthening the Forums powers. Its tasks shall be extended to: (i) the consideration of
substantiated complaints, evidence or other relevant information presented by recognised third parties of possible non-compliance; (ii) the joint
discussion and assessment of the national market surveillance programmes following their submission to the Commission; (iii) the review of
the results of assessments of the functioning of market surveillance.
Fees: Members proposed that the costs for their type-approval and market surveillance activities shall be covered by the Member States either
through their national budgets, a fee-based structure (where national fees are levied on the manufacturers who have applied for type-approval
in the Member State concerned), or apply a combination of both methods.
Penalties: the proposal provides that the Commission may impose administrative fines (of up to EUR 30 000 per vehicle) on the manufacturer
concerned in breach of the Regulation. Administrative fines levied by the Commissions may be used for the purposes of market surveillance
measures and for measures to support persons negatively affected by infringements of this Regulation or other such activities to the benefit of
affected consumers and, where appropriate, environmental protection.
In cases of non-conformity the consumer may face personal damage or damage to their own property. In such cases the consumer should be
entitled to pursue compensation under relevant legislation addressing defective products or non-conforming goods.
Database: Members proposed that the Commission should establish an online type-approval database for the secure electronic exchange of
information related to type-approval procedures, authorisations issued and market surveillance.
