Summary

PURPOSE: to establish a Union programme to support specific activities enhancing the involvement of consumers and other financial services
end-users in Union policy making in the field of financial services for the period of 2017-2020.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: in 2007, the confidence of financial services' end-users', and in particular that of consumers in the field of financial services,
was shaken by the financial and economic crisis. Therefore, the European legislators considered that the concerns of consumers and other
financial services end-users should be systematically and adequately taken into account (retail investors, savers, insurance holders, pension
fund participants and borrowers) to restore citizens' confidence in the soundness of the financial sector.
Several actions have been undertaken by the European Commission to ensure that the views of consumers and other end-users of financial
services are heard, notably with (i) the establishment in 2010 of the Financial Services Users Group (FSUG) which acts as a forum where
non-industry stakeholders representatives are regularly kept informed about the financial services policy issues under development and are
invited to give their views and express their concerns and suggestions on intended legislative initiatives and (ii) the systematic inclusion of
consumers and civil society organisations representatives in the various expert groups set up to assist the Commission or the European
Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) in their work in the financial services area.
At the end of 2011, the Commission launched a pilot project aiming to provide grants to support the development of a financial expertise
centre to the benefit of end-users and non-industry stakeholders and enhance their capacity to participate in Union policy making in the field of
financial services. It awarded operating grants to two non-profit organisations based in Brussels, Finance Watch and Better Finance between
2012 and 2015. These grants were awarded under a pilot project during two years, 2012 and 2013, and a preparatory action since 2014.
The evaluation of the pilot project and the subsequent preparatory action carried out in 2015 concluded that the policy objectives have been
generally achieved. However, despite regular efforts, both organisations did not manage to attract stable and significant funding from other
donors, independent from the financial industry, and, therefore, remain heavily dependent on Union funding.
Since 2012, both beneficiaries have been funded up to 60% of their eligible costs through Union grants and they remain heavily dependent on
Union funding.
Co-funding these beneficiaries along the same line as of 2017 is the only option which can ensure that all the results and effects that have
materialised since 2012 according to the evaluation results are likely to continue.
CONTENT: the proposal seeks to establish a Union programme for the period from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2020 to support the
activities of the organisations Finance Watch and Better Finance who contribute to the achievement of the policy objectives of the Union in
relation to enhancing the involvement of consumers and other financial services end-users, as well as stakeholders representing their interests
in Union policy making in the field of financial services.
The Programme shall cover the following activities:
research activities, including production of own research, data, expertise;
awareness and dissemination activities, including to a wide audience of non-experts;
activities reinforcing the interactions between the members of the beneficiary organisations and advocacy activities fostering the
positions of those members at Union level.
The Programme shall have the following objectives:
to further enhance the participation of consumers and other financial services end-users, as well as stakeholders representing their
interests, in Union policymaking in the area of financial services;
to contribute to the information of consumers and other financial services end-users, as well as stakeholders representing their
interests, about issues at stake in the regulation of the financial sector.
These objectives shall be monitored in particular through a yearly description of the actions performed by the beneficiaries of the Programme
and an annual activity report, which shall include quantitative and qualitative indicators for each activity planned and conducted by the
beneficiaries.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the impact on expenditure (operational appropriations) is estimated at EUR 6 000 000 for the period from
2017-2020.

2016/0182(COD) - 26/01/2017 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs adopted the report by Philippe LAMBERTS (Greens/EFA, BE) on the proposal for a
regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on establishing a Union programme to support specific activities enhancing the
involvement of consumers and other financial services end-users in Union policy making in the field of financial services for the period of
2017-2020.
The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, exercising its prerogative as an associated committee in accordance with
Article 54 of the Rules of Procedure, also gave its opinion on the report.
The committee recommended that the European Parliaments position, adopted at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure,
should amend the Commission proposal as follows:
Subject matter and scope: the Programme shall be established for the period from 1 May 2017 to 31 December 2020 and shall co-finance the
following activities, including research activities:
engaging with consumers and other financial services end-users by liaising with existing consumer networks and helplines in the
Member States and, in the area of financial services;

raising awareness, dissemination, financial education and training, directly or through their national members, including to a wide
audience of consumers and other financial services end-users in the area of financial services, including banking services, and
non-experts;
activities reinforcing the interactions between the members of the beneficiary organisations as well as advocacy and policy advice
activities fostering the positions of those members at Union level and fostering the public and general interest in financial and EU
regulation.
Beneficiaries: in order to cover the interests of consumers and other financial services end-users in as many Member States as possible, the
beneficiaries shall seek to expand their network of active members within the Member States, and thus strive to ensuring comprehensive
geographical coverage. The Commission shall facilitate further information and develop contacts on potential members.
Implementation of the Programme: the maximum rate of direct co-financing shall be 60% of eligible costs. The maximum rate of cumulative
non-direct Union funding shall be limited to 70% of the total eligible costs of the beneficiary.
Evaluation procedure: no later than twelve months before the end of the Programme, the Commission shall submit to the European Parliament
and the Council an evaluation report on the achievement of the Programme's objectives and shall make all information used for the evaluation
available to them upon request.

2016/0182(COD) - 27/04/2017 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 547 votes to 49, with 54 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council on establishing a Union programme to support specific activities enhancing the involvement of
consumers and other financial services end-users in Union policy making in the field of financial services for the period of 2017-2020.
The European Parliaments position adopted at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure amended the Commission proposal as
follows:
Subject-matter and scope: the Programme shall be established for the period from 1 May 2017 to 31 December 2020 and shall co-finance, in
addition to research activities:
the dialogue with consumers and other financial services end-users by liaising with existing consumer networks and helplines in
Member States in order to identify issues relevant for Union policy-making for the protection of the interests of consumers in the area
of financial services;
activities for raising awareness, dissemination activities, and the provision of financial education and training, directly or through their
national members, including to a wide audience of consumers, other financial services end-users and non-experts;
activities reinforcing the interactions between the members of the organisations as well as advocacy and policy advice activities
fostering the positions of those members at Union level and fostering the public and general interest in financial and Union regulation.
Beneficiaries: in order to represent the interests of consumers and other financial services end-users in as many Member States as possible, a
beneficiary shall seek to expand its network of active members within the Member States and to ensure comprehensive geographical
coverage. The Commission shall assist the beneficiaries in identifying potential members in Member States. The Programme shall be regularly
assessed. To this end, the Commission requires that each beneficiary shall provide a yearly description of the actions performed by the
beneficiary under the Programme; an annual activity report and a financial report.
Transparency: any communication or publication related to an action performed by a beneficiary and funded under the Programme shall
indicate that the beneficiary has received funding from the budget of the Union.
Implementation of the Programme: in order to benefit from the Programme, a beneficiary shall submit every year to the Commission a detailed
description of the activities planned for the following year, including their objectives, expected results and impact, estimated costs and
timeframe, as well as relevant indicators by which to assess them.
The maximum rate of direct co-financing shall be 60 % of eligible costs. In the event that a beneficiary receives funding from members who are
themselves recipients of funding under Union financing programmes, the Commission shall limit its annual contribution to ensure that total
direct and indirect Union funding for actions under the Programme to that beneficiary does not exceed 70 % of total eligible costs.
Evaluation procedure: no later than 12 months before the end of the Programme, the Commission shall submit to the European Parliament
and to the Council an evaluation report on the achievement of the Programmes objectives and upon request shall provide them with the
information used for the evaluation work and available to the Commission, while respecting applicable data protection rules and confidentiality
obligations.
