Summary

2016/0814(CNS) - 29/07/2016 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to launch the automated data exchange with regard to dactyloscopic data in Denmark.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Implementing Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to
follow its opinion.
BACKGROUND: according to Decision 2008/615/JHA on the stepping up of cross-border cooperation, particularly in combating terrorism and
cross-border crime, the supply of personal data provided for under that Decision may not take place until the general provisions on data
protection set out in that Decision.
Council Decision 2008/616/JHA on the implementation of Decision 2008/615/JHA provides that the verification that the above condition has
been met with respect to automated data exchange is to be done on the basis of: (i) an evaluation report based on a questionnaire, (ii) an
evaluation visit and (iii) a pilot run.
Denmark completed the questionnaire on data protection and the questionnaire on dactyloscopic data exchange. A successful pilot run has
been carried out by Denmark with Germany. An evaluation visit also took place in Denmark.
An overall evaluation report was presented in which the Council concluded, on 12 July 2016, that Denmark had fully implemented the general
provisions on data protection set out in Chapter 6 of Decision 2008/615/JHA.
CONTENT: this draft Council implementing Decision aims, for the purposes of automated searching of dactyloscopic data, to authorise
Denmark to receive and supply personal data pursuant to Decision 2008/615/JHA as from the date of the entry into force of this Decision.
The United Kingdom and Ireland shall take part in the adoption of the proposed Decision.

2016/0814(CNS) - 14/10/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading

The committee recommended the Parliament to approve the Council proposal without amendment.
The draft Council implementing Decision aims, for the purposes of automated searching of dactyloscopic data, to authorise Denmark to
receive and supply personal data pursuant to Decision 2008/615/JHA as from the date of the entry into force of this Decision.
