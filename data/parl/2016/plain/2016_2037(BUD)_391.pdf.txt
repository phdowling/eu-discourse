2016/2037(BUD) - 09/03/2016 Commission draft budget
PURPOSE: presentation of the draft amending budget No 1 to the general budget for 2016.
CONTENT: the purpose of Draft Amending Budget (DAB) No 1 for the year 2016 is twofold:
1. to create the budget structure for the proposed new instrument to provide emergency support within the Union, and to make an
amount of EUR 100 million in commitment appropriations available for immediate funding needs. At this early stage of the year no
alternative source of redeployment of commitment appropriations can easily be identified within heading 3. Therefore, the Commission
proposes to finance the appropriations for the new instrument requested in this draft amending budget through an adjustment of the
funding currently available for the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) . The amount proposed to be transferred from AMIF
takes into account the immediate funding needs of the new instrument as well as the current state of implementation and the
foreseeable needs of AMIF in the coming months. The Commission will carefully monitor the implementation of the 2016 budget and
may propose transfers and/or an amending budget to secure the necessary funding for both AMIF and the emergency support
instrument at the appropriate time. This will take account of the evolving needs assessment for the year as a whole;
2. to reinforce the staffing levels of the European Counter-Terrorism Centre in EUROPOL, to enable the agency to play a central role in
the fight against terrorism in the EU, in particular in the light of the terrorist attacks in Paris of 13 November 2015. The related funding
for the remuneration of new staff (25 additional establishment plan posts, 5 contract agents and 5 seconded national experts) amounts
to EUR 2 million, and is proposed to be redeployed from the Police Union actions under the Internal Security Fund (ISF). The related
additional appropriations for the remuneration of new staff has been calculated on the basis of an average of six months' presence in
2016.
Overall, this DAB has no net impact on the level of appropriations in the 2016 budget.

2016/2037(BUD) - 16/03/2016 Council position on draft budget
On 10 March 2016, the Commission submitted to the Council draft amending budget (DAB) No 1 to the general budget for 2016 related to the
new instrument to provide emergency support within the Union.
The purpose of this DAB is:
1. to create the budget structure for the proposed new instrument to provide emergency support within the Union, and to make through
redeployments within MFF heading 3 an amount of EUR 100 million in commitment appropriations (c/a) and EUR 80.2 million in
payment appropriations (p/a) available for immediate funding needs. At this early stage of the year no alternative source of
redeployment of c/a can easily be identified within heading 3. Therefore, the Commission proposes to finance the appropriations for
the new instrument requested in this DAB through an adjustment of the funding currently available for the Asylum, Migration and
Integration Fund (AMIF). The amount proposed to be transferred from AMIF takes into account the immediate funding needs of the
new instrument, as well as the current state of implementation and the foreseeable needs of AMIF in the coming months. The
Commission will carefully monitor the implementation of the 2016 budget and may propose transfers and/or an amending budget to
secure the necessary funding for both AMIF and the emergency support instrument at the appropriate time. This will take account of
the evolving needs assessment for the year as a whole; and
2. to reinforce the staffing levels of the European Counter-Terrorism Centre in EUROPOL, to enable the agency to play a central role in
the fight against terrorism in the EU, in particular in the light of the terrorist attacks in Paris of 13 November 2015. The related funding

for the remuneration of new staff (25 additional establishment plan posts, 5 contract agents and 5 seconded national experts) amounts
to EUR 2 million in c/a and p/a, and is proposed to be redeployed within heading 3 from the Police Union actions under the Internal
Security Fund (ISF).
Overall, DAB No 1 to general budget for 2016 has no net impact on the level of appropriations in the 2016 budget.
On 16 March 2016, the Council adopted its position on DAB No 1 to the general budget for 2016 as set out in the technical annex to the
Council draft budget (see Council document 7068/16).

2016/2037(BUD) - 11/04/2016 Budgetary report tabled for plenary, 1st reading
The Committee on Budgets adopted the report by José Manuel FERNANDES (EPP, PT) the Council position on Draft amending budget
No 1/2016 of the European Union for the financial year 2016, new instrument to provide emergency support within the Union.
Members recalled that the massive influx of refugees and migrants into Europe has created an exceptional situation whereby a large number
of persons require urgent humanitarian assistance within the Union. This emergency situation has overstretched the response capacity of the
Member States most affected and no appropriate instrument was available at Union level to address humanitarian needs. Accordingly, the
Commission presented on 2 March 2016 a proposal for a Council Regulation aimed at filling a gap in the available instruments in order to
address humanitarian needs within the territory of the Union. It subsequently proposed a Draft amending budget aimed at creating the budget
structure for that instrument and at making available, from redeployment within the heading 3 of the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF),
EUR 100 million in commitment appropriations and EUR 80.2 million in payment appropriations for immediate funding needs.
The Commission also proposed to reinforce the staffing levels of the European Counter-Terrorism Centre in EUROPOL and to provide the
corresponding commitment and payment appropriations for an amount of EUR 2.0 million to be redeployed from the Internal Security Fund.
In this context, Members welcomed the proposal by the Commission and pointed to the deteriorating situation of migrants and asylum seekers.
They stressed the need to show solidarity with the Member States facing such an emergency situation on their territory.
Members noted that, following the setting-up of two Trust Funds and of a Facility for Refugees in Turkey, a new ad hoc mechanism has been
put in place without an overall strategy to address the refugee crisis.
They pointed to the problem that the new instrument is not founded on a Commission proposal for a regulation under the ordinary legislative
procedure, and considered that a more sustainable legal and budgetary framework should be envisaged in order to allow for humanitarian aid
within the Union to be mobilised in the future , when circumstances so require (e.g. special instruments to be counted outside the MFF
ceilings). The committee believed that the entire amount cannot be covered through redeployments without affecting the delivery of the
Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) and that, therefore, this EUR 100 million must be a frontloading of appropriations that will need
to be compensated at a later stage. Accordingly, it supported the mobilisation of the Contingency Margin for the remaining amount for this year
as soon as necessary and invited the Commission to present a proposal in this respect.
Lastly, whilst calling on Parliament to adopt draft amending budget No 1/2016 as presented by the Commission, given the urgency of the
situation, Members urged the Commission to exclude all agencies dealing in the broader sense with migration and security from the 5% staff
reduction target as they are all understaffed given the tremendous increase in workload.

2016/2037(BUD) - 13/04/2016 Budgetary text adopted by Parliament
The European Parliament adopted by 584 votes to 64 with 33 abstentions, a resolution on the Council position on Draft amending budget
No 1/2016 of the European Union for the financial year 2016, new instrument to provide emergency support within the Union.
Parliament recalled that the massive influx of refugees and migrants into Europe has created an exceptional situation whereby a large number
of persons require urgent humanitarian assistance within the Union. This emergency situation has overstretched the response capacity of the
Member States most affected and no appropriate instrument was available at Union level to address humanitarian needs. Accordingly, the
Commission presented on 2 March 2016 a proposal for a Council Regulation aimed at filling a gap in the available instruments in order to
address humanitarian needs within the territory of the Union. It subsequently proposed a Draft amending budget aimed at creating the budget
structure for that instrument and at making available, from redeployment within the heading 3 of the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF),
EUR 100 million in commitment appropriations and EUR 80.2 million in payment appropriations for immediate funding needs.
The Commission also proposed to reinforce the staffing levels of the European Counter-Terrorism Centre in EUROPOL and to provide the
corresponding commitment and payment appropriations for an amount of EUR 2.0 million to be redeployed from the Internal Security Fund.
In this context, Parliament welcomed the proposal by the Commission and pointed to the deteriorating situation of migrants and asylum
seekers. It stressed the need to show solidarity with the Member States facing such an emergency situation on their territory.
It particularly called on the Commission to consider a more sustainable legal and budgetary framework in order to allow for humanitarian aid
within the Union to be mobilised in the future, when circumstances so require. Parliament noted that such emergency funding, meant at
responding to crises and unforeseen situations, should by its very nature be covered by special instruments and be counted outside the MFF
ceilings;
AMIF: Parliament noted that the Commission proposes to finance the first instalment under this new instrument by redeploying appropriations
from the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) appropriations, which were already meant to ensure burden-sharing between Member
States in dealing with refugees. It believed that the entire amount cannot be covered through redeployments without affecting the delivery of
the AMIF, which is bound to come under pressure this year and might need further reinforcements if the relocation scheme is to reach full
speed. It considered, therefore, this EUR 100 million to be a frontloading of appropriations which will need to be compensated at a later stage.
Parliament noted that there is no margin left under heading 3 and that the Flexibility Instrument has already been used in its entirety for 2016.

it supported, therefore, the mobilisation of the Contingency Margin for the remaining amount for this year as soon as necessary and invited the
Commission to present a proposal in this respect. Parliament anticipated that an upward revision of the MFF ceiling for heading 3 will prove to
be inevitable in order to address all needs linked to the refugee and migration crisis;
Lastly, whilst affirming its willingness to adopt Draft amending budget No 1/2016, Parliament urged the Commission to exclude all agencies
dealing in the broader sense with migration and security from the 5% staff reduction target as they are all understaffed given the tremendous
increase in workload.

amount of EUR 100 million in commitment appropriations available for immediate funding needs and EUR 80.2 million in payment
appropriations. The appropriations for the new instrument are made available through an adjustment of the funding currently available
for the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF);
