Summary

2016/0816(CNS) - 10/11/2016 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: the launch of an automated data exchange with regard to DNA in Greece.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Implementing Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to
follow its opinion.
BACKGROUND: according to Decision 2008/615/JHA on the stepping up of cross-border cooperation, particularly in combating terrorism and
cross-border crime, the supply of personal data provided for under that Decision may not take place until the general provisions on data
protection set out in that Decision have been implemented in the national law of the territories of the Member States involved in such supply.
Council Decision 2008/616/JHA on the implementation of Decision 2008/615/JHA provides that the verification that the above condition has
been met with respect to automated data exchange and is to be done on the basis of an evaluation report based on: (i) a questionnaire drawn
up by the relevant Council Working Group concerns each of the automated data exchanges; (ii) an evaluation visit and (iii) a pilot run.
Greece has completed the questionnaire on data protection and the questionnaire on DNA data exchange. A successful pilot run has been
carried out by Greece with the Netherlands.
An evaluation visit has taken place in Greece and a report on the evaluation visit has been produced by the Dutch evaluation team.
On 13 October 2016, the Council, having noted the agreement of all Member States bound by Decision 2008/615/JHA, concluded that Greece
had fully implemented the general provisions on data protection set out in Chapter 6 of Decision 2008/615/JHA.
CONTENT: the proposed implementing Council Decision seeks to authorise Greece to receive and supply personal data pursuant to Decision
2008/615/JHA as from the date of the entry into force of this Decision for the purposes of automated searching and comparison of DNA data.
As the conditions for triggering the exercise of such implementing powers have been met and the procedure in this regard has been followed,
an Implementing Decision on the launch of automated data exchange with regard to DNA data in Greece should be adopted in order to allow
that Member State to receive and supply personal data pursuant to Articles 3 and 4 of Decision 2008/615/JHA.
The United Kingdom and Ireland shall participate in the proposed Decision.

2016/0816(CNS) - 03/03/2017 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading

personal data pursuant to Decision 2008/615/JHA as from the date of the entry into force of this Decision for the purposes of automated
searching and comparison of DNA data.

2016/0816(CNS) - 15/03/2017 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 597 votes to 61, with 30 abstentions, following the consultation procedure, a legislative resolution on the
