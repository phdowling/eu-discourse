Summary

2016/2800(RSP) - 28/06/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 395 votes to 200 with 71 abstentions, a resolution on the decision to leave the EU resulting from the UK
referendum.
The resolution was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ALDE, and Greens/EFA groups.
A swift implementation of the withdrawal procedure: Parliament took note of the wish of the citizens of the United Kingdom to leave the EU. It

pointed out that the will expressed by the people must be entirely and fully respected, starting with the activation of Article 50 of the Treaty on
European Union (TEU) as soon as possible.
In order to prevent damaging uncertainty for everyone and to protect the Unions integrity, the UK Prime Minister should notify the outcome of
the referendum to the European Council of 28-29 June 2016 in order to launch the withdrawal procedure as soon as possible.
Parliament recalled that any new relationship between the UK and the EU might not be agreed before the conclusion of the withdrawal
agreement. It also recalled that the consent of the European Parliament is required under the Treaties, and that it must be fully involved at all
stages of the various procedures concerning the withdrawal agreement and any future relationship.
Relaunch the European project now: Members considered that the current challenges require reflection on the future of the EU and that there
is a need to reform the Union and make it better and more democratic. While some Member States may choose to integrate more slowly or to
a lesser extent, the core of the EU must be reinforced and Ã  la carte solutions should be avoided.
Stressing that the reforms must result in a Union which delivers what citizens expect, Parliament felt that the need to promote common values,
provide stability, social justice, sustainability, growth and jobs, overcome persistent economic and social uncertainty, protect citizens and
address the challenge of migration requires developing and democratising, in particular, the Economic and Monetary Union and the area of
freedom, security and justice, as well as strengthening the common foreign and security policy.
Council Presidencies: Parliament called on the Council to change the order of its Presidencies to prevent the process of withdrawal from
jeopardising the management of the day-to-day business of the Union. For its part, it would enact changes in its internal organisation to reflect
the will of a majority of the citizens of the United Kingdom to withdraw from the European Union.
Lastly, Parliament called for a roadmap for a better Union based on exploiting the Lisbon Treaty to the full, to be completed by a revision of the
Treaties.
