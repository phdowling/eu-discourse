2016/0383(NLE) - 15/02/2017 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Chile on trade in organic products.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: in accordance with a Council Decision, the Agreement between the European Union and Chile on trade in organic products
was signed, subject to its conclusion.
The Agreement aims at fostering trade in organic products, contributing to the development and expansion of the organic sector in the Union
and in Chile and achieving a high level of respect for the principles of organic production.
It is now necessary to approve the Agreement on behalf of the European Union.
CONTENT: with this proposed Council Decision, the Council is called upon to approve, on behalf of the EU, the Agreement between the
European Union and the Republic of Chile on trade in organic products.
In addition to fostering trade in organic products, the Agreement envisages the following actions:
expansion of the organic sector in the EU and Chile;

achieving a high level of respect for the principles of organic production, of guarantee of the control systems and of integrity of organic
products;
improved protection of the respective organic logos of the Union and Chile;
enhanced regulatory cooperation between the Parties on issues related to organic production.
Equivalence agreement: The Union and Chile are called upon to recognise the equivalence of their respective rules on organic production and
control systems as regards organic products. Accordingly, the Agreement provides that the products listed in the Annexes shall be mutually
recognised as equivalent to the production of one party or the other in accordance with the legislation of one or the other parties.
Joint committee: the Joint Committee on Organic Products established pursuant to the Agreement, deals with certain aspects of the
implementation of the Agreement. In particular, it has the power to amend the lists of products in Annexes I and II to the Agreement. The
Commission should be authorised to represent the Union in the Joint Committee.
The Commission should be empowered to approve amendments to the lists of products in Annexes I and II to the Agreement, on the condition
that it inform the representatives of the Member States. It should also be empowered to unilaterally suspend the recognition of equivalence, on
the condition that it inform the representatives of the Member States prior to doing so.
In cases where representatives of the Member States representing a blocking minority object to the position presented by the Commission, the
Commission should not be allowed to approve amendments to the lists of products in Annexes I and II or to suspend the recognition of
equivalence. In such cases, the Commission should present a proposal for a Council decision on the basis of Article 218(9) of the Treaty.

2016/0383(NLE) - 14/07/2017 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on International Trade adopted the report by Inmaculada RODRÍGUEZ-PIÑERO FERNÁNDEZ (S&D, ES) on the draft Council
decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Chile on trade in organic products.
The committee recommended the European Parliament to give its consent to the conclusion of the agreement.
As a reminder, the above-mentioned agreement, aims at fostering trade in organic products, contributing to the development and expansion of
the organic sector in the Union and in the Republic of Chile and achieving a high level of respect for the principles of organic production, of
guarantee of the control systems and of integrity of organic products.
By means of the agreement, Chile will recognise as equivalent all EU organic products included in the scope of Regulation (EC) No 834/2007
on organic production and labelling of organic products.
While supporting the objectives of the Commission proposal and the draft Council Decision, the INTA Rapporteur recalled the need to fully
inform Parliament throughout the lifecycle of international agreements, negotiation and implementation.
In this context, the Rapporteur regretted the lack of timely information by other institutions during the negotiations of the present Agreement,
and expected the Council and the Commission to redress the situation.

2016/0383(NLE) - 14/09/2017 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading

and Chile and to achieving a high level of compliance with the principles of organic production, control systems and integrity of biological
products.
Under the terms of the Agreement, the Union and Chile will recognise as equivalent all EU organic production and their control systems with
