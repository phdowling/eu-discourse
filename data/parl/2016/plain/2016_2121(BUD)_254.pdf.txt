2016/2121(BUD) - 30/06/2016 Commission draft budget
PURPOSE: presentation of the draft amending budget No 3 for the year 2016 concerning the institutions security needs.
CONTENT: following the November 2015 attacks in Paris and those of March 2016 in Brussels, all institutions have reviewed their security
needs in the short to medium term.
The draft budget for 2017 incorporates additional elements related to security for almost all institutions. However, in some cases the need to
accelerate the reinforcement of security measures and installations requires additional resources in 2016 already.
Draft amending budget (DAB) No 3 for the year 2016 proposes to reinforce the budget for security for a total of EUR 15.8 million, as follows:
European Schools: EUR 3.5 million (security of persons and guarding of buildings);
European Parliament: EUR 200 000 (financing of 35 additional posts for the recruitment of additional security agents in order to
provide armed protection of the strategic points inside the European Parliament's buildings in all three duty stations);
European Commission: EUR 5 million to strengthen security for persons and buildings. The following amounts are to be used for the
same purposes:
Court of Justice: EUR 1.8 million;
European Court of Auditors: EUR 2.1 million;
European Economic and Social Committee: EUR 400 000;
Committee of the Regions: EUR 300 000;
European External Action Service: EUR 2.5 million.
The result is an increase of non-differentiated expenditure in the 2016 budget for heading 5 Administration.
However, it is proposed to redeploy the necessary payment appropriations from the ITER operational line in heading 1a to avoid any impact on
the global level of payments.
At the end of 2015, the ITER budget item 32 05 01 02 received an amount of assigned revenue which corresponds to the outturn balance from

the year 2014 of the European Joint Undertaking for ITER Fusion for Energy.
Since these appropriations are available, an equivalent amount in fresh payment appropriations can be redeployed elsewhere in the 2016
budget. As the requirements of this DAB in heading 5 are for non-differentiated appropriations, the amount of payment appropriations needed
must correspond to the commitments, thus the Commission proposes to offset the increase of EUR 15.8 million in payment appropriations in
heading 5 by a reduction of the same amount from budget item 32 05 01 02 in heading 1a.

2016/2121(BUD) - 11/10/2016 Council position on draft budget
On 30 June 2016, the Commission submitted to the Council draft amending budget No 3 to the general budget for 2016 concerning additional
commitment and payment appropriations necessary to cover increased security expenditure in almost all Institutions, and European Schools.
The amount requested is EUR 15.8 million.
This draft amending budget (DAB) also includes a modification to the establishment plan of the European Parliament with 35 additional posts
(1 at AD 5 level and 34 at AST/SC 1 level) for the recruitment of security agents.
This DAB results in an increase of non-differentiated expenditure in the 2016 budget under heading 5 (Administration). The necessary
payment appropriations will be redeployed from the ITER operational line (item 32 05 01 02) under sub-heading 1a.
The modification to the European Parliament's establishment plan amounts to EUR 200 000 and is included in the overall amount mentioned
above.
On 11 October 2016, the Council adopted its position on DAB No 3 to the general budget for 2016 as set out in the technical annex to its
position on the draft amending budget.

2016/2121(BUD) - 17/10/2016 Budgetary report tabled for plenary, 1st reading
The Committee on Budgets adopted the joint report by José Manuel FERNANDES (EPP, PT) (Section III Commission) and Gérard DEPREZ
(ALDE, BE) on the Council position on Draft amending budget No 3/2016 of the European Union for the financial year 2016: Security of the
Institutions.
Members recalled that recent terror attacks have led the Union institutions to review their security needs and to identify the need for additional
resources already in 2016. Draft amending budget No 3/2016 consequently proposed to reinforce the budget for security by a total amount of
EUR 15.8 million in the European Schools, the European Parliament, the European Commission, the Court of Justice, the European Court of
Auditors, the European Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions and the European External Action Service.
In particular, Draft amending budget No 3/2016 aims to create 35 additional permanent posts for the recruitment of additional security agents
in the European Parliament. These posts should be maintained in the 2017 budget and exempt from the 5 % staff reduction target, as they
correspond to a new activity.
In parallel, Members took note of Draft amending budget No 3/2016, as submitted by the Commission and called on the European Parliament
to approve the Council position on Draft amending budget No 3/2016.

2016/2121(BUD) - 25/10/2016 Final act
PURPOSE: adoption of amending budget No 3 for the year 2016 concerning the institutions security needs.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Definitive adoption (EU, Euratom) 2016/2210 of Amending budget No 3 of the European Union for the financial year
2016.
CONTENT: this amending budget 3/2016 aims to integrate additional resources into the 2017 budget in order to strengthen the security of the
European institutions, in particular in the form of enhanced human resources.
Amending budget (DAB) No 3 for the financial year 2016 provides for a budgetary reinforcement of EUR 15.8 million divided between the main
European institutions and the European Schools.
The corresponding payment appropriations will be redeployed from the ITER operational budget line (item 32 05 01 02) under subheading 1a
of the budget.

2016/2121(BUD) - 25/10/2016 Budgetary text adopted by Parliament
The European Parliament adopted by 511 votes to 120 with 65 abstentions, a resolution on the Council position on Draft amending budget No
3/2016 of the European Union for the financial year 2016: Security of the Institutions.
Parliament recalled that recent terror attacks have led the Union institutions to review their security needs and to identify the need for
additional resources already in 2016. Draft amending budget No 3/2016 consequently proposed to reinforce the budget for security by a total
amount of EUR 15.8 million in the European Schools, the European Parliament, the European Commission, the Court of Justice, the European
Court of Auditors, the European Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions and the European External Action Service.
In particular, draft amending budget No 3/2016 aims to create 35 additional permanent posts for the recruitment of additional security agents in
the European Parliament. These posts should be maintained in the 2017 budget and exempt from the 5 % staff reduction target, as they
correspond to a new activity.

Taking note of Draft amending budget No 3/2016, as submitted by the Commission the European Parliament approved the Council position on
Draft amending budget No 3/2016 and instructed its President to declare that Amending budget No 3/2016 has been definitively adopted.
