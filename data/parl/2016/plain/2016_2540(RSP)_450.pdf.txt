Summary

The European Parliament adopted a resolution on the introduction of compatible systems for the registration of pet animals across Member
States.
The text was adopted in plenary by the EPP, S&D, ECR, ALDE, GUE/NGL and Greens/EFA groups.
Parliament reaffirmed that owners should be able to travel with their pets in a safe, controlled manner throughout the Union. It welcomed the
improvements to the Pet Travel Scheme introduced by Regulation (EU) No 576/2013.
However, Members with concern the evidence from non-governmental organisations, law enforcement agencies, competent authorities and
veterinarians that clearly demonstrates the growing illegal abuse of the Pet Travel Scheme, which is being exploited for commercial purposes .
It also noted with concern the growing trade, both legal and illegal, in wild animals commonly kept as pets.
Pet animals that are traded illegally are often badly bred, poorly socialised and at increased risk of disease: 70 % of the new diseases that
have emerged in humans over recent decades are of animal origin, and animals commonly kept as pets are carrier hosts of many zoonoses,
including rabies.
Noting that there are discrepancies as regards the type of information held, the animals covered by the identification and registration
requirements, Members noted that compatible systems of identification and registration requirements for dogs and cats would reduce the
scope for document falsification and illegal trading, thus improving animal welfare, protecting public and animal health and providing for
effective intra-Union traceability.
The Commission is called, upon the entry into force of the Regulation on Transmissible Animal Diseases (Animal Health Law), to:
adopt a delegated act concerning detailed, compatible systems for the means and methods of identification and registration of dogs
and cats;
consider adopting delegated acts laying down rules concerning detailed, compatible systems for the means and methods of
identification and registration of pet animals, as defined by Annex 1 of the same regulation.
Members believe that a compatible system for the identification and registration of pets across the EU will have wider benefits than just
tackling illegal trade alone, and that these benefits should include tracing the source of disease outbreaks and addressing animal abuse and
other animal welfare concerns.
