Summary

2016/0217(NLE) - 14/07/2016 Initial legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude the Agreement establishing the EU (European Union) ? LAC (Latin, American and Caribbean) International
Foundation.
PROPOSED ACT: Joint Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: the European Union (EU) and the Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries signed a strategic partnership at the first
bi-regional summit of their heads of state and government in Rio de Janeiro in 1999.
Since 1999, successive summits have ensured a steady intensification of political dialogue and progress on jointly tackling a wide range of
issues including climate change, migration, the fight against illicit drugs, the promotion of human rights and gender equality, education and
cultural issues, and in the fields of science and technology.
At the Fifth EU-LAC Summit (Lima, 2008), leaders of both regions decided to consider the creation of a bi-regional foundation to foster debate
on common strategies and action to strengthen the partnership and enhance its visibility.
The EU-LAC Foundation was formally established in Hamburg in 2011 as a German civil law body, pending the possible conclusion of an
international constituent agreement to convert it into an international organisation.
Council Decision 2012/493/EU authorised the Commission to open negotiations for an international agreement on the creation of the EU-LAC
Foundation as an international organisation, with the EU, its Member States and the LAC countries as members. Negotiations started in
December 2012 and the European Parliament has been kept regularly informed throughout the negotiations.
The High Representative and the Commission consider that the objectives set by the Council in its directives on the negotiation of the
Agreement have been met, and that the draft Agreement can be submitted for signature and conclusion.
CONTENT: the joint proposal constitutes the legal instrument for the conclusion of the Agreement establishing the EU-LAC International
Foundation is hereby approved on behalf of the European Union. The aim of the Agreement is to establish the EU-LAC Foundation as an
international organisation with legal personality under public international law.
The Foundation can be seen as an instrument of EU common foreign policy because its activities contribute to the convergence of Member

States' actions towards the Latin American and Caribbean region, ensuring that the EU is able to assert its interests and values in the
framework of the partnership between the two regions.
Specific activities of the Foundation contribute to the political dialogue between the EU and CELAC in areas such as global governance and
the promotion of democracy, human rights and the rule of law.
The Foundation will also strengthen cooperation between the EU and LAC regions, fostering intercultural exchange, notably by facilitating and
promoting participation by, and inputs from, civil society and other social actors. It will aim to:
support EU-CELAC policy dialogue and cooperation involving some or all LAC countries in key areas of common interest such as
research, sustainable development, climate change, competitiveness, jobs and growth, and gender equality;
conduct or support analysis and research on themes of interest for the partnership;
develop and support bi-regional networks and foster exchanges of knowledge and best practices between them.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the conclusion of the Agreement will have no direct budgetary implications, as it will be on a voluntary basis.
The Commission has made financial contributions to the Foundation since it was established under German civil law in 2011, most recently
(through the Partnership Instrument) the sum of EUR 3 million for the two years from October 2015. Some LAC and EU countries, including
Germany as host country, have contributed financially on one or more occasions.

2016/0217(NLE) - 30/09/2016 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude the Agreement establishing the EU (European Union) LAC (Latin, American and Caribbean) International Foundation.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: in accordance with a Council Decision, the Agreement establishing the EU-LAC International Foundation was signed and
subject to its conclusion at a later date.

CONTENT: under this proposed Decision, it is proposed that the Council approve the Agreement establishing the EU-LAC International
Foundation on behalf of the Union.
The text of the Agreement is attached to this Decision.
The Agreement intends to establish the EU-LAC Foundation which aims to strengthen bi-regional partnerships, encourage further mutual
knowledge and understanding between both regions and enhance the mutual visibility between both regions.

as fostering intercultural exchange (for further details on the objectives of the Agreement, please refer to the summary of the initial legislative
proposal from 14.7.2016).

2016/0217(NLE) - 04/09/2017 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Foreign Affairs adopted the report by Javier COUSO PERMUY (GUE/NGL, ES) on the proposal for a Council decision on
the conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Agreement establishing the EU-LAC International Foundation.
The committee recommended the European Parliament to give its consent to the conclusion of the agreement.
As a reminder, the European Union-Latin America and Caribbean Foundation (EU-LAC Foundation) was created in 2010 by the Heads of
State or Government of the European Union and of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC). The countries of the EU
and of CELAC, as well as the EU itself, are its members.
The Foundation is a tool of the EU-CELAC partnership and its activities feed into intergovernmental dialogue. Its mission is to strengthen and
promote the strategic partnership between the two regions, enhance its visibility and foster the active participation of the respective civil
societies.
The explanatory statement accompanying the report underlined:
the existence of strong historical, social and economic relations as well as shared values ??between Latin America, the Caribbean
and the European Union;
the acceptance of the European Union and CELAC of the objectives and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, as
well as their commitment to defend the sovereign equality of all States, respect their territorial integrity and political independence and
to defend the settlement of disputes by peaceful means and in conformity with justice and international law;
the progress made in cooperation between the European Union and Latin America and the Caribbean since the creation of CELAC in
2010.
For these reasons, the EU-LAC Foundation will strengthen bi-regional dialogue, deepen mutual relations, meet the expectations of Latin
American and European citizens and effectively address global challenges.
