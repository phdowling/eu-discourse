In brief

2016/2090(INI) - 20/07/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee of Inquiry into Emission Measurements in the Automotive Sector adopted the interim report by Pablo ZALBA BIDEGAIN (EPP,
ES) and Gerben-Jan GERBANDY (ADLE, NL) on the inquiry into emission measurements in the automotive sector.
To recall, on 17 December 2015, the European Parliament decided to set up a Committee of Inquiry of 45 Members to investigate alleged
contraventions or maladministration in the application of Union law in relation to emission measurements in the automotive sector, without
prejudice to the jurisdiction of national or Union courts.
The Committees investigation has to focus on the compliance by the Commission and Member States authorities with the obligations imposed
by Regulation (EC) No 715/2007, with particular regard to its Articles 5(2), 5(3), 13(1), 13(2) and 14(3).
Furthermore, the EMIS Committee is called to collect and analyse information to ascertain whether the Commission and the Member States
had evidence of the use of defeat mechanisms, as well as to collect and analyse information on the implementation by the Member States of
Directive 2007/46/EC.
Lastly, the Committee is required to make any recommendations that it deems necessary in the matter.
The mandate of the EMIS Committee foresees that the committee of inquiry present an interim report within six months and a final report
within 12 months of starting its work.
This interim report called on the European Parliament to encourage the Committee of Inquiry to pursue its work and to implement fully its
mandate and that it supports all the actions and initiatives leading to the accomplishment of the mandate.
The report called on the Commission to ensure prompt support and full transparency in assisting the work of the Committee of Inquiry, with full
respect for the principle of loyal cooperation, providing all the technical and political support possible, in particular through swifter submission
of requested documentation.
It also called on the governments, parliaments and competent authorities of Member States to assist the Committee of Inquiry in its tasks.

2016/2090(INI) - 13/09/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 618 votes to 26, with 7 abstentions, a resolution on the inquiry into emission measurements in the
automotive sector.
To recall, on 17 December 2015, the European Parliament decided to set up a Committee of Inquiry of 45 Members to investigate alleged

contraventions or maladministration in the application of Union law in relation to emission measurements in the automotive sector, without
prejudice to the jurisdiction of national or Union courts. The Committee shall make any recommendations that it deemed necessary in that
matter.
The Committee of Inquiry has sent various questionnaires to Member States, Union institutions and other bodies, and has opened a public call
for evidence on its website. It presented its interim report on 20 July 2016.
Parliament encouraged the Committee of Inquiry to pursue its work and to implement fully its mandate and that it supports all the actions and
initiatives leading to the accomplishment of the mandate.
Members called:
on the Commission to ensure prompt support and full transparency in assisting the work of the Committee of Inquiry, with full respect
for the principle of loyal cooperation, providing all the technical and political support possible, in particular through swifter submission
of requested documentation;
on the Member States to provide the Committee of Inquiry with the necessary technical and political support, in particular by enabling
the Commission to submit documents that are requested more swiftly and, if the submission of documents requires the Member
States consent, by accelerating their internal proceedings for the granting of such consent;
for the governments, parliaments and competent authorities of Member States to assist the Committee of Inquiry in its tasks with full
respect for the principle of loyal cooperation established in Union law.
