Briefing

2016/0370(CNS) - 01/12/2016 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to modernise the VAT rules in the context of cross-border business to consumer (B2C) e-commerce.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Directive.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consultation with the European Parliament but without needing to
follow the latters opinion.
BACKGROUND: In its communication of May 2015 entitled Strategy for Digital Single Market for Europe' and its communication of April 2016
on an action plan on VAT entitled 'Towards a single EU VAT area , the Commission placed a high priority to overcoming barriers to

cross-border e-commerce arising from onerous VAT obligations as well as an inherent lack of neutrality which harms EU business.
It feels that there are three reasons to take action:
it has been estimated that the costs of complying with VAT obligations are on average EUR 8 000 annually for each Member State to
which a business supplies. This is a significant cost for business, in particular SMEs;
the current system is not neutral as EU businesses are at a clear disadvantage to non-EU businesses which can legitimately and
through high levels of noncompliance make VAT-free supplies into the EU;
the complexity of the existing system as well as the current exemption for the importation of small consignments means that Member
States lose valuable tax revenues. It is estimated that between VAT foregone and non-compliance from cross-border e-commerce
such losses are currently as high as EUR 5 billion annually.
In preparing this proposal the Commission carried out a regulatory fitness check of the existing Mini One Stop Shop (MOSS), which applies to
B2C supplies of electronic services as well as the 2015 changes to the place of supply rules for such services.
The proposal takes due account of this assessment. In particular, the proposal will address shortcomings and barriers faced by SMEs and
micro-businesses.
IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment on the proposal was examined in June 2016 by the Regulatory Scrutiny Board. The Board
gave a positive opinion to the proposal with some recommendations that have been taken on board.
CONTENT: the proposal aims to amend Directive 2006/112/EC and Directive 2009/132/EC as regards certain value added tax obligations for
supplies of services and distance sales of goods. The main provisions in the proposal are as follows:
extension of MOSS from 1 January 2021 to intra-Community distance sales of tangible goods and services other than electronic
services as well as to distance sales of goods from third countries;
the introduction of a simplified arrangements for global declaration and payment of import VAT for importers of goods destined for final
consumer where VAT has not been paid through the MOSS system; it is proposed that VAT will be collected from customers on
importation and a simple monthly declaration to customs will be transmitted by the transporter;
the removal of the existing intra-Community distance sales thresholds which are a cause of distortions in the single market;
the removal of the existing VAT exemption for the importation of small consignments (total value between EUR 10 and EUR 22) from
suppliers in third countries which disadvantages EU sellers;
the introduction of a new annual threshold of EUR 10 000 below which the place of supply of services that may be covered by the
intra-Community special scheme for electronic services remains in the Member State of the supplier; and the introduction of an annual
threshold of EUR 100 000 below which simplified rules will apply to determine the place of establishment; these thresholds may be
applied from 2018 to ecommerce and 2021 at the latest for distance sales;
allowing for EU sellers to apply home country rules in areas such as invoicing and record keeping; and
greater coordination between Member States when auditing of cross-border businesses who use the VAT system to ensure high
compliance rates.
In quantitative terms, the introduction of an intra-EU cross-border threshold in 2018 will take 6 500 businesses out of the current MOSS system
leading to a potential cost saving for these businesses of EUR 13 million. The introduction in 2018 of simplified evidence requirements will
benefit an additional 1 000 businesses. The threshold which will also apply to goods when the MOSS is extended in 2021 will benefit 430 000
businesses with potential savings to these businesses of up to EUR 860 million.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal is expected to increase VAT revenues for Member States by EUR 7 billion per year. It is
estimated that the proposal will reduce administration burdens for business by EUR 2.3 billion annually.

2016/0370(CNS) - 16/10/2017 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs adopted, following a special legislative procedure (Parliaments consultation), the report by
C?t?lin Sorin IVAN (S&D, RO) on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 2006/112/EC and Directive 2009/132/EC as regards
certain value added tax obligations for supplies of services and distance sales of goods.
The committee called on Parliament to approve the Commission proposal subject to the following amendments:
Need for a definitive system: Members introduced a recital urging the adoption of a definitive VAT regime based on the destination principle,
recalling in this respect that the VAT gap in the EU was approximately EUR 152 billion in 2015, while cross-border fraud accounted for a loss
of VAT revenue of approximately EUR 50 billion a year.
The amended text recalled that the Commission's proposal is only a building block for closing the VAT gap and that further measures are
needed to effectively combat VAT fraud in the Union.
Online platforms: the Commission's proposal provides for online platforms to be held responsible for the collection of VAT in supplies of
services. Members, however, proposed that these platforms should also be held liable for the collection of VAT when they act as
intermediaries in supplies of goods imported from third countries where the intrinsic value of the items does not exceed EUR 150 and they
have an annual turnover exceeding EUR 1 million.
Place of supply of services: the proposal provides that the place of supply of telecommunications, broadcasting and television services and
services provided by electronic means to a non-taxable person shall be the place where that person is established.
Members pointed out that this provision should not apply where the total value, exclusive of VAT, of such supplies does not in the current
calendar year exceed EUR 35 000 (EUR 10 000 according to the Commission proposal) and did not exceed this threshold in the previous
calendar year.
Record keeping: one amendment proposed that the records shall be kept for a period of five years from the end of the calendar year during
which the transaction was carried out.
Implementation period: the Commission and Member States have a legal obligation to allow business to register to the new one-stop-shop by

31 December 2020. Members, however, considered that business should be given 3 additional months until 1 April 2021 (instead of 1 January
2021), to adapt their own IT systems to connect it to the new one-stop shop.
Impact on postal services: Member States and the Commission should pay particular attention to the impact on the postal services sector as
the amending Directive could lead to an increase in administrative costs for small consignments.

2016/0370(CNS) - 30/11/2017 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 540 votes to 30, with 68 abstentions, in line with a special legislative procedure (Parliaments
consultation), a legislative resolution on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 2006/112/EC and Directive 2009/132/EC as
regards certain value added tax obligations for supplies of services and distance sales of goods.
Parliament approved the Commission proposal subject to the following amendments:
Need for a definitive system: Parliament introduced a recital urging the adoption of a definitive VAT regime based on the destination principle,
recalling in this respect that the VAT gap in the EU was approximately EUR 152 billion in 2015, while cross-border fraud accounted for a loss
of VAT revenue of approximately EUR 50 billion a year. It also stressed the need for additional measures to effectively combat VAT fraud in
the Union.
Mini-One-Stop-Shop (MOSS): Member States should further promote the mini-one-stop shop to a wider range of SMEs as 99% of VAT
revenue processed through the mini-one-stop shop is reported by only 13% of registered companies.
Online platforms: the Commission's proposal provides for online platforms to be held responsible for the collection of VAT in supplies of
services. Members, however, proposed that these platforms should also be held liable for the collection of VAT when they act as
intermediaries in supplies of goods imported from third countries where the intrinsic value of the items does not exceed EUR 150 and they
have an annual turnover exceeding EUR 1 million.
Place of supply of services: the proposal provides that the place of supply of telecommunications, broadcasting and television services and
services provided by electronic means to a non-taxable person shall be the place where that person is established.
Members pointed out that this provision should not apply where the total value, exclusive of VAT, of such supplies does not in the current
calendar year exceed EUR 35 000 (EUR 10 000 according to the Commission proposal) and did not exceed this threshold in the previous
calendar year.

which the transaction was carried out.

the amending Directive could lead to an increase in administrative costs for small consignments.
