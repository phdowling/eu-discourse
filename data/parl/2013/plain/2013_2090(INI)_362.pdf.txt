2013/2090(INI) - 22/11/2013 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Development adopted the own-initiative report by Véronique DE KEYSER (S&D, BE) on the efforts of the international
community in the area of development and of state building in South Sudan.
Members recalled that the South Sudan is also one of the poorest countries in the world, with 50 % of the population living below the poverty
line. They also recalled that this newly created country, having emerged from a war, is in danger of failing if the international community and
local actors fail to cooperate in developing a joint strategy to turn it into a democratic and inclusive state.
Welcoming the most recent signs of eased tensions between the governments of South Sudan and the Republic of the Sudan, Members
called on the governments of both countries and the international community to continue and intensify efforts to resolve the outstanding issues
left unresolved following the expiration of the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement and South Sudans independence in July 2011. They
proposed that the governments of Sudan and South Sudan consider, as a last resort, referring the outstanding problems with regard to the
border to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) so that they may be resolved legally and peacefully . The two countries were also urged to
respect fully the Addis Ababa Agreements of September 2012.
A strategy for the whole region: Members reiterated their support for the European Unions regional engagement under the EU Strategic
Framework for the Horn of Africa, as well as under the comprehensive approach to Sudan and South Sudan. They call, however, for further
coordination of the strategy across the wider region and a full dialogue with regional partners for the purpose of improving cooperation and
development;
They urged the authorities of Sudan and South Sudan to implement fully the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), which calls on the two
states to tackle issues concerning power sharing, citizenship, oil revenues and debt sharing. Members noted the positive signs of cooperation
between the two governments, such as the initiative to allow cross-border movements as a preparatory step to establishing trade agreements
and they called on Sudan and South Sudan to resume negotiations on the supply of oil to the North. They expressed concern over the
unilateral announcement by the Sudanese Government with regard to the shutting down of oil exports from South Sudan and the freezing of all
sectoral agreements.
In general terms, Members called on all groups and parties within South Sudan to develop a joint vision for their country and its peaceful,
prosperous and equitable development. They proposed that the Government of South Sudan consider launching an inclusive national debate
with a view to ending interethnic conflict and envisaging peaceful relations.
Human rights: the report stressed the importance of demonstrating to the people of South Sudan the value and effectiveness of their new
democratic state, including the establishment of a stable government which does not operate by arbitrary presidential decrees. It called for
anti-corruption measures and the ratification of international conventions on human rights. Members called on key international partners,
especially EU Members States, the Commission and the EEAS, to maintain their commitment to development and state-building and to human
security for all South-Sudanese people. They supported the engagement of the EU as a key partner in the context of the New Deal through a
State-Building Compact, as well as the European Unions contribution (USD 4.9 million) to the International Organisation for Migration, which
will facilitate dialogue and communication among the different tribes and clans on how to share scarce resources (water, pastureland). They
recalled incidentally that all forms of budgetary support to developing countries require proper risk management tools.
The EUs Strategic Framework for the Horn of Africa and European aid: Members called for the regular review of the EUs Strategic Framework
for the Horn of Africa and its comprehensive approach to Sudan and South Sudan. They welcomed the fact that the EU has committed
EUR 285 million in development aid to South Sudan since 2011, when South Sudan gained independence (excluding Member State aid), in
addition to humanitarian aid.
Members supported the focus of EU aid for South Sudan on:

·

agriculture;

·

democratic governance;

·

the rule of law;

·

education and health;

·

capacity-building of the South Sudanese legal system;

·

promoting access to education and sexual and reproductive rights and healthcare services for women.

Projects funded by the EU must be monitored and assessed regularly.
Sustainable development: Members stressed the need to make major sustainable investments in infrastructure, in the provision of basic
services and in agricultural development in South Sudan. They called on the EU to support efforts of land governance and the strengthening of
tenure security in the country, while at the same time taking into account local informal arrangements of dispute resolution and recognition of
customary tenure.
The report encouraged the Government of South Sudan to:
·

foster economic diversification

·

reduce hydrocarbon dependence;

·

take measures to promote the involvement of women in the rural economy;

·

ensure access to drinking water;

It stressed at the same time that the need to ensure human security for all South-Sudanese people requires a renewed effort by the
Government of South Sudan and its international partners to follow through with the disarmament , demobilisation and reintegration (DDR) of
armed groups and to undertake broader security sector reform (SSR).
Fight against all forms of violence: Members were deeply concerned that women and children of the armed conflicts in South Sudan and called
on all warring parties to end the impunity of the perpetrators. They urged the South Sudanese Government to ensure gender equality and
called on the South Sudanese authorities to introduce a family law setting out a minimum marriageable age and conditions for the custody of
children.
Electoral process: the committee was surprised that the United Nations, in view of the contributions made by the EU to its budget, does not
grant the Union special status during election missions, ensuring that its observers are protected and can do their job properly (i.e. affording
them secure accommodation and access to health care). It called on the government of South Sudan to conduct a constitutional review
process before the 2015 elections.
Members welcomed the goal of having a female representation of at least 25 % in the cabinet and also urged the South Sudanese
Government to increase efforts to establish a roadmap, in order to sustain the process of transition until constitutional order and the rule of law
have been fully re-established throughout the country, through the organisation of democratic, free, fair and transparent elections in 2015. The
EU and its international partners were asked to increase their support for the upcoming electoral process.
Protecting human rights: Members urged the Government of South Sudan to enact any media laws to protect media freedom and to end the
harassment of human rights activists and journalists. They also urged the authorities to carry out impartial investigations into all allegations of
threats against human rights activists. The Human Rights Council was asked establish a meaningful follow-up mechanism on the situation of
human rights in South Sudan, such as an independent expert.
Members strongly opposed the death penalty in all circumstances and called on South Sudan to take specific steps to move towards its
abolition.
Womens rights: lastly, Members stressed that women in South Sudan faced multiple forms of discrimination as well as violations of their
fundamental rights, which must be eliminated. They reiterated the need to fight against illiteracy and improve access to education for women.
They welcomed the creation of the first College of Nursing and Midwifery at the Juba teaching hospital, and called for more health centres
based on this model throughout the whole country.

2013/2090(INI) - 10/12/2013 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a resolution on the efforts of the international community in the area of development and of state building in
South Sudan.

respect fully the Addis Ababa Agreements of September 2012.
Parliament regretted that the recommendation made by the African Union to the governments in Khartoum and Juba that a referendum on the
disputed region of Abyei be held in October 2013 had not been followed up by any effective action. It called on the South Sudanese authorities
to ensure that Misseriya nomads are able to participate in the referendum, as Khartoum was otherwise opposed to this.

A strategy for the whole region: Parliament reiterated their support for the European Unions regional engagement under the EU Strategic
Framework for the Horn of Africa, as well as under the comprehensive approach to Sudan and South Sudan. It called, however, for further
