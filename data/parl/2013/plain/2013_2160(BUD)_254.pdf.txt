2013/2160(BUD) - 25/07/2013 Commission draft budget
PURPOSE: to present Draft Amending Budget NÂ° 7/2013.
CONTENT: Draft amending budget (DAB) No 7 for the year 2013 covers an increase of commitment appropriations of EUR 150 million in
heading 1b of the multi-annual financial framework (MFF).
This is with the aim of addressing certain issues resulting from the final outcome of the negotiations of the MFF for the years 2014-2020,
affecting France, Italy and Spain. The European Council of 27 and 28 June 2013 considered that a budgetary solution should be given to that
matter.
In view of the current economic crisis and as a contribution to the special effort needed to address the specific situations of unemployment, in
particular youth unemployment, and of poverty and social exclusion in these Member States, the Commission considers that the most
appropriate way to assist them is by increasing the European Social Fund (ESF).
As the existing allocations have already been fully committed in the EU budget, the Commission proposes to increase the ESF allocations to
those three Member States for the year 2013.
The reinforcement of EUR 150 million in commitment appropriations will be covered by the margin under the expenditure ceiling of heading 1b
(EUR 16 million), and by the mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument (EUR 134 million) targeted at this specific action.

2013/2160(BUD) - 09/10/2013 Council position on draft budget
On 25 July 2013, the Commission submitted to the Council draft amending budget (DAB) No 7/2013 proposing to increase commitment
appropriations under sub-heading 1b (Cohesion for growth and employment) by EUR 150 million in 2013.
This amount aims at reinforcing appropriations for the European Social Fund in favour of France, Italy and Spain , in order to tackle youth
unemployment, poverty and social exclusion, and has been agreed in the context of the MFF negotiations in the margin of the European
Council of 27/28 June 2013.
In parallel, it submitted a proposal for a Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on the mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument
for an amount of EUR 134 million.

On 7 October 2013, the Council adopted its position on draft amending budget No 7/2013, as set out in the technical annex to this explanatory
memorandum, as well as the text of the Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on the mobilisation of the Flexibility
Instrument.

2013/2160(BUD) - 06/11/2013 Budgetary report tabled for plenary, 1st reading
The Committee on Budgets adopted the report by Giovanni LA VIA (EPP, IT) on the position of the Council on the Draft Amending Budget No

Members recalled that the Draft Amending Budget for the 2013 fiscal year covers an increase of commitment appropriations of EUR 150
million in heading 1b of the multi-annual financial framework (MFF) to address some problems affecting France, Spain and Italy resulting from
the final outcome of the negotiations on the MFF for the 2014-2020 period.
Knowing that these additional funds should contibute to addressing the specific situations of unemployment, in particular youth unemployment,
and of poverty and social exclusion in these Member States, Members underlined that the Commission considers that the most appropriate
way to assist them is by increasing the European Social Fund (ESF).
The reinforcement of EUR 150 million in commitment appropriations will be covered by the margin under the expenditure ceiling of heading 1b
(EUR 16 million), and by the mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument (EUR 134 million) targeted at this specific action.
Members therefore called on the European Parliament to approve the Commission proposal to reserve the additional funds to the ESF
programmes underway in the Member States concerned. They looked to the Commission to report in due time to the European Parliament on
the actions and measures financed by these funds. Furthermore, they called on the European Parliament to approve, unamended, the Council
position on the Draft Amending Budget No 7/2013.
