Summary

2013/2997(DEA) - 12/03/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 402 votes to 258 with 14 abstentions, a resolution objecting to the Commission delegated regulation of
12 December 2012 amending Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the provision of food
information to consumers as regards the definition of engineered nanomaterials.
To recall, Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 on Food Information to Consumers provided that all food ingredients present in the form of
engineered nanomaterials must be clearly indicated in the list of food ingredients to ensure consumer information. The Regulation,
accordingly, provided for a definition of engineered nanomaterials.
The Commission delegated regulation excluded all food additives included in the Union lists from the new definition of engineered
nanomaterial and instead suggested that the need for specific nano-related labelling requirements relating to those additives should be
addressed in the context of the re-evaluation programme in accordance with Commission Regulation (EU) No 257/2010, by amending, if
necessary, the conditions of use in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 on food additives.
Noting that it was precisely food additives that may be present as nanomaterials in food, Parliament considered that this blanket exemption
annulled the labelling provisions for all food additives that were engineered nanomaterials.
The Commission had justified this blanket exemption for all existing food additives by stating that indicating such food additives in the list of
ingredients followed by the word nano in brackets may confuse the consumers as it may suggest that those additives are new while in reality
they have been used in foods in that form for decades.
Parliament rejected this justification as erroneous and irrelevant, as the Regulation on food information did not provide for a distinction
between existing and new nanomaterials, but explicitly required labelling of all ingredients present in the form of engineered nanomaterials.
The resolution stressed that the Commissions stated intention to address the need for specific nano-related labelling requirements concerning
food additives on the Union lists in the context of the re-evaluation programme was inappropriate as it confuses safety issues with general
labelling requirements for consumer information purposes. Moreover, this also suggested that the Commission questions the very need for
specific nano-labelling
On the basis of these considerations, Parliament felt that that the Commission delegated regulation was not compatible with the aim and
content of Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011and that it exceeded the delegated powers conferred on the Commission under the latter. It called on
the Commission to submit a new delegated act which takes into account the position of Parliament.
