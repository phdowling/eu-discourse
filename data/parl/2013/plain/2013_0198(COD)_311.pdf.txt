OJ L 084 20.03.2014, p. 0069 Summary

2013/0198(COD) - 18/06/2013 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 2368/2002 as regards the inclusion of Greenland in implementing the Kimberley Process
certification scheme.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: this proposal aims at enabling Greenland to participate in the Kimberley Process certification scheme on rough diamonds
through its cooperation with the European Union. The scheme set out in the proposal would allow for the import and export of rough diamonds
from Greenland to the Union as well as to other participants of the certification scheme, provided that all imports and exports of rough
diamonds are verified and, for exports, certified by Union authorities pursuant to the rules set out in Regulation (EC) No 2368/2002
implementing the Kimberley Process certification scheme for the international trade in rough diamonds.
IMPACT ASSESSMENT: Greenland and Denmark undertake to transpose and implement in the legislation applicable to Greenland the

relevant provisions of Regulation (EC) No 2368/2002 as regards the conditions and formalities for importing and exporting rough diamonds,
their transit to a participant other than the Union, the participation of the Union, including Greenland, in the Kimberley Process certification
scheme and associated obligations.
LEGAL BASIS: Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
CONTENT: the proposal extends the territory of the Union to also cover the territory of Greenland for the purposes of the Kimberley Process
certification scheme. Accordingly, Greenland will be prohibited to accept imports or exports of rough diamonds to or from outside of the
territory of the Union without a valid Kimberley Process (KP) certificate.
The amendments will allow for the export of rough diamonds from Greenland to third countries as long as they are accompanied by an EU KP
certificate. The conditions for certification previously required evidence that the rough diamonds were lawfully imported into the Union.
For diamonds mined and extracted in Greenland that have never been exported before, an alternative condition is introduced by this proposal,
notably to demonstrate proof in this regard.
In addition, the proposal:
sets out the modalities of submitting rough diamonds to Union authorities for verification,
extends the special rules for transit to Greenland.
enables Greenland's participation in the Committee for the implementation of the Regulation, and
enables Greenland's representation in the Kimberley Process and cooperation with other Member States through the Commission.
The proposal is closely connected to a proposal for a Council Decision setting out specific rules for the circulation of rough diamonds between
the Union and Greenland.
The application of that Decision is proposed to align with the entry into force of this amendment to the Regulation.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implications for the EUs budget.

2013/0198(COD) - 19/12/2013 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on International Trade adopted the report by Vital MOREIRA (S&D, PT) on the proposal for a regulation of the European
Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 2368/2002 as regards the inclusion of Greenland in implementing the
Kimberley Process certification scheme.
The committee recommended that Parliaments position adopted in first reading, following the ordinary legislative procedure, should take over
the Commission proposal.
Members supported the specific changes proposed by the Commission to the proposal without proposing amendments.

2013/0198(COD) - 04/02/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 493 votes to 0, with 17 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 2368/2002 as regards the inclusion of Greenland in
implementing the Kimberley Process certification scheme.
Parliament adopted its position at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure taking over the Commission proposal.

2013/0198(COD) - 26/02/2014 Final act
PURPOSE: to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 2368/2002 as regards the inclusion of Greenland in implementing the Kimberley Process
certification scheme.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Regulation (EU) N° 257/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No
2368/2002 as regards the inclusion of Greenland in implementing the Kimberley Process certification scheme.
CONTENT: Council Regulation (EC) No 2368/2002 sets up a Community System of certification and import and export controls for rough
diamonds for the purposes of implementing the Kimberley Process certification scheme.
Greenland is not part of the Union territory but it is included in the list of overseas countries and territories set out in Annex II to the Treaty on
the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
Council Decision 2014/136/EU sets out the rules and procedures enabling Greenlands participation in the Kimberley Process certification
scheme on rough diamonds through its cooperation with the Union. Such cooperation would strengthen economic relations between the Union
and Greenland in the diamond industry, and in particular it would enable Greenland to export rough diamonds accompanied by the EU
Certificate issued for the purposes of the certification scheme, with a view to promoting the economic development of Greenland.
This Regulation amends Regulation (EC) No 2368/2002 in order to enable Decision 2014/136/EU to enter into force and in particular to
provide for the inclusion of Greenland in the certification scheme.
Certification conditions: Greenland will be prohibited from accepting imports or exports of rough diamonds to or from a participant other than
the Union without a valid certificate. The amendments contained in this Regulation will allow for the export of rough diamonds from Greenland
to third countries as long as they are accompanied by the EU Certificate.

Other provisions: the amended Regulation
·

sets out the modalities of submitting rough diamonds to Union authorities for verification;

·

extends the special rules for transit to Greenland;

·

enables Greenland's participation in the Committee for the implementation of the Regulation, and

·

enables Greenland's representation in the Kimberley Process and cooperation with other Member States through the Commission.

The Regulation is closely linked to the Council Decision setting out specific rules for the circulation of rough diamonds between the Union and
Greenland.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 09.04.2014.
