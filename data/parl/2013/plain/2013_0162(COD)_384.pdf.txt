2013/0162(COD) - 30/05/2013 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to contribute to the protection of cultural objects in the context of the internal market by enabling Member States to secure the
return of any cultural object which is classified as a national treasure.
PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: The European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on
an equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: Council Directive 93/7/EEC on the return of cultural objects unlawfully removed from the territory of a Member State1 was
adopted in 1993, when the internal frontiers were abolished, in order to protect the Member States cultural objects that are classified as
national treasures.
The assessments of the Directive have shown that the effectiveness of this instrument is limited due to: (i) the conditions making objects
classified as national treasures eligible for return; (ii) the short time available for bringing return proceedings; (iii) the cost of compensation. The
need for improved administrative cooperation and consultation between the central authorities in order to enable them to better implement the
Directive has been stressed.
UNESCOs Convention of 1970 and the UNIDROIT Convention of 1995 on Stolen or Illegally Exported Cultural Objects have not been ratified
by all Member States.
Despite the variety of instruments available, trafficking in cultural objects has become one of the most widespread forms of illegal trade .
Noting the major impact this problem has on the Member States, the Council of the European Union concluded on 13 and 14 December 2011
that measures needed to be taken to make preventing and combating crime against cultural objects more effective.
IMPACT ASSESSMENT: this proposal is accompanied by an executive summary of the impact assessment. The preferred approach results in
a combination of options 2 (Promoting the use of common tools by the central authorities) and 3 (Revision of Directive 93/7/EEC).
LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
CONTENT: the aim of this proposal is to enable Member States to secure the return of any cultural object which is classified as a national
treasure and has been unlawfully removed from their territory since 1993.
The changes made to the provisions of Directive 93/7/EEC concern:
extending its scope to cover all cultural objects classified as national treasures within the meaning of Article 36 of the Treaty;
prescribing the use of the Internal Market Information (IMI) system for administrative cooperation and information exchanges between
the central authorities;
extending the time given to the authorities of the requesting Member State to check the nature of the cultural object found in another
Member State;
extending the time-limit for bringing return proceedings;
indicating which authority of the requesting Member State starts the period for bringing return proceedings;
stipulating that the possessor has the burden of proof that due care and attention was taken when the cultural object was acquired;
indicating the common criteria for interpreting the concept of due care and attention;
extending the time-limit for the reports assessing and reviewing the application of the Directive (these shall be drawn up every five
years).
BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal involves only administrative costs. The impact on the EU budget is estimated at EUR 1.25 million
for 2015-2019.

2013/0162(COD) - 25/11/2013 Debate in Council
The Council adopted a general approach on the proposal for a directive on the return of cultural objects unlawfully removed from the territory
of a member state.
The Council accepted the main changes introduced by the Commission proposal into the current legislation, such as:
deletion of the annex, which specifies categories of cultural objects eligible for return, together with financial and age thresholds. Thus,
any cultural object that a member state defines as a national treasure will be eligible for return;
extension of deadlines so that member states would have five months, instead of the current two months, to check that the object
discovered in another member state is a national treasure, and three years instead of one year to initiate the return proceedings
before the competent national court;
placing the burden of proof on the possessor for compensation purposes;
use of the Internal Market Information System to improve administrative cooperation and information exchanges between national
authorities.

Given the proposal to remove the annex, the reference to the Committee on the export and return of cultural goods which was responsible for
its application has been deleted. However, the Council wished to keep a platform for the exchange of experience and best practices in this
field and requested the Commission to establish an expert group for that purpose. Furthermore, the Council extended the period for
transposition of the directive into national law to 18 months instead of the 12 months proposed by the Commission.
The adoption of a general approach has paved the way for the incoming Greek Presidency to start informal negotiations with the European
Parliament with the aim of adopting the proposal before the end of this Parliament's term. The competent EP Committee (CULT) vote on the
proposal is scheduled for 21 January 2014.

2013/0162(COD) - 28/01/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Culture and Education adopted the report by Marie-Christine VERGIAT (GUE/NGL, FR) on the proposal for a directive of
the European Parliament and of the Council on the return of cultural objects unlawfully removed from the territory of a Member State (recast)
The committee recommended that the position of Parliament adopted in first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure should amend
the Commission proposal as follows:
Purpose: the directive aims to ensure the physical return of cultural objects which are classified or defined by a Member State as a national
treasure possessing artistic, historic or archaeological value within the meaning of Article 36 of the Treaty, which have been unlawfully
removed from the territory of a Member State, even if they originate from illegal excavations.
It is recalled Article 36 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) empowers the Union to take steps to protect cultural
objects defined or classified as national treasures, in the context of the opening-up of the Union's internal borders.
This Directive applies irrespective of whether the object in question was classified or defined by a Member State as a national treasure before
or after its unlawful removal from the territory of that Member State.
Cultural object is defined as an object which: is classified or defined, before or after its unlawful removal from the territory of a Member State,
as being among the national treasures possessing artistic, historic or archaeological value under national legislation or administrative
procedures within the meaning of Article 36 of the Treaty. The directive will thus cover cultural objects such as objects of historical,
paleontological, ethnographic or numismatic interest or scientific value, whether or not they form part of a public or other collection or are
single items, provided that they are classified or defined as national treasures.
Tasks of Member States competent authorities: the proposal provides that national authorities must cooperate and stresses the need for
consultation between competent authorities. The amended text states that the latter must:
·

disseminate all information concerning cultural objects stolen or unlawfully removed from their territory which are listed in their
registers or similar documents;

·

notify the Member States concerned, where a cultural object is found in their own territory and there are reasonable grounds for
believing that it has been unlawfully removed from the territory of another Member State;

·

enable the competent authorities of the requesting Member State to check that the object in question is a cultural object, provided
that the check is made within six months of the notification. With that aim in view, the requested Member State must reply to the
requesting Member State as quickly as possible, so that the latter can carry out the check within the time limit.

Exchange of information: the report specified the exchanges of information, including those referred to in provisions relating to illegally
removed cultural objects, should be conducted using the Internal Market Information System (IMI), in accordance with the applicable legal
provisions on the protection of personal data and privacy.
However, the competent central authorities would be able to use other means of communication in addition to the IMI, in particular where the
specific measures required in the context of a return procedure make this essential.
However, in the case of objects forming part of public collections, and objects listed in the inventories of ecclesiastical or other religious or lay
institutions in the Member States where they are subject to special protection arrangements under national law, return proceedings shall be
subject to a time-limit of 75 years.
Compensation for the possessor: the text stated that the possessor might not claim the compensation if he failed to exercise the level of due
care and attention required by the circumstances.
Extension of the scope to other cultural objects: each Member State may agree to extend the obligation to return cultural objects to objects
other than those defined in the directive, including in respect of cultural objects unlawfully removed from the territory of other Member States
prior to 1 January 1993.
Reports: Member States shall send the Commission every five years, and for the first time on 1 December 2017 at the latest, a report on the
application of the directive.
The Commission shall send the European Parliament, the Council and the European Economic and Social Committee, every five years, and
for the first time on 1 July 2018 at the latest, a report reviewing the application of the Directive. The report shall be accompanied by any
appropriate proposals for the revision of the directive.
Advisory committee: Members wanted an advisory committee of national experts to be established for the purpose of examining any issues
relating to the implementation of the Directive, in particular the adaptation of the IMI system to take account of the specific nature of cultural
objects, the exchange of information between Member States and good practices implemented by them.

2013/0162(COD) - 16/04/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading

The European Parliament adopted by 626 votes to 40 with 8 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a directive of the
European Parliament and of the Council on the return of cultural objects unlawfully removed from the territory of a Member State (recast).
Parliament adopted its position at first reading under the ordinary legislative procedure. The amendments adopted in plenary were the result of
a compromise between Parliament and Council. They amend the Commissions proposal as follows:
Purpose: Parliament and Council agreed that the directive applied to the return of cultural objects defined or classified by a Member State as
being among national treasures, which had been unlawfully removed from the territory of that Member State.
Cultural object: this was defined as means an object which was classified or defined by a Member State, before or after its unlawful removal
from the territory of that Member State, as being among the national treasures possessing artistic, historic or archaeological value under
national legislation or administrative procedures within the meaning of Article 36 TFEU.
Tasks of competent national authorities: Member States' central authorities shall cooperate and promote consultation between the Member
States' competent national authorities. The latter shall upon application by the requesting Member State, seek a specified cultural object,
which has been unlawfully removed from its territory, identifying the possessor and/or holder. It was specified that the application must include
all information needed to facilitate the search, with particular reference to the actual or presumed location of the object.
In order to cooperate and consult with each other, the central authorities of the Member States will use a module of the Internal Market
Information System ("IMI") specifically customised for cultural objects. They may also use the IMI to disseminate relevant case-related
information concerning cultural objects, which had been stolen or unlawfully removed from their territory.
Exchange of information: the amendments stipulated that the exchange of information should be conducted using the IMI in accordance with
the applicable legal provisions on the protection of personal data and privacy. However, competent central authorities may use other means of
communication in addition to the IMI.
In order to maintain the platform for the exchange of experience and good practices on the implementation of the Directive among Member
States, the Commission should set up an expert group, composed of experts from the Member States' central authorities responsible for the
implementation of the Directive, The group should be involved, inter alia, in the process of customising a module of the IMI system for cultural
objects.
Limitation: in the case of objects forming part of public collections, and objects belonging to inventories of ecclesiastical or other religious
institutions in the Member States where they were subject to special protection arrangements under national law, return proceedings should be
subject to a time limit of 75 years.
Compensation for possessor: where return of the object was ordered, the competent court in the requested Member State should award the
possessor fair compensation according to the circumstances of the case, provided that the possessor demonstrated that he exercised due
care and attention in acquiring the object.
Application to other cultural objects: the amended text stated that it should be possible for Member States to return cultural objects other than
those defined in the directive.

2013/0162(COD) - 15/05/2014 Corrigendum to final act

2013/0162(COD) - 15/05/2014 Final act
PURPOSE: to allow the return of cultural objects classified or defined by a Member State as being among national treasures, which have been
unlawfully removed from the territory of that Member State.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Directive 2014/60/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on the return of cultural objects unlawfully removed
from the territory of a Member State and amending Regulation (EU) No 1024/2012 (Recast)
CONTENT: this Directive recasts Directive 93/7/EEC and applies to the return of cultural objects classified or defined by a Member State as
being among national treasures, which have been unlawfully removed from the territory of that Member State after 1 January 1993.
Extension of the scope of the legislation: the scope of the Directive is extended to all cultural objects classified or defined by a Member State,
as being among the national treasures possessing artistic, historic or archaeological value under national legislation or administrative
procedures within the meaning of Article 36 TFEU.

The Directive should thus cover objects of historical, paleontological, ethnographic, numismatic interest or scientific value, whether or not they
form part of public or other collections or are single items, and whether they originate from regular or clandestine excavations, provided that
they are classified or defined as national treasures.
Furthermore, cultural objects classified or defined as national treasures should no longer have to belong to categories or comply with
thresholds related to their age and/or financial value in order to qualify for return under the Directive.
Administrative cooperation between Member States: the Directive requires that central authorities cooperate efficiently with each other and
exchange information relating to unlawfully removed cultural objects through the use of the Internal Market Information System (IMI) provided
for by Regulation (EU) No 1024/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council. In order to improve cooperation, a module of the IMI
system specifically customised for cultural objects is established.
The exchange of information will be conducted using the IMI in accordance with the applicable legal provisions on the protection of personal
data and privacy, without prejudice to the possibility for the competent central authorities to use other means of communication in addition to
the IMI.
Extension of time-limits:
·

Member States will have six months, instead of the current two months, to check that the object discovered in another Member State
is a national treasure. This longer period should allow Member States to take the necessary measures to preserve the cultural object
and, where appropriate, prevent any action to evade the return procedure.

·

The time-limit for bringing return proceedings is also extended to three years (rather than one year) after the Member State from
whose territory the cultural object was unlawfully removed became aware of the location of the cultural object and of the identity of its
possessor or holder.

Such proceedings may, in any event, not be brought more than 30 years after the object was unlawfully removed from the territory of the
requesting Member State.
However, in the case of objects forming part of public collections, and objects belonging to inventories of ecclesiastical or other religious
institutions in the Member States where they are subject to special protection arrangements under national law, return proceedings shall be
subject to a time-limit of 75 years.
Compensation for the possessor: where return of the object is ordered, the Directive provides that the competent court in the requested
Member State shall award the possessor fair compensation according to the circumstances of the case, provided that the possessor
demonstrates that he exercised due care and attention in acquiring the object.
Report: by 18 December 2015 and every five years thereafter, Member States shall submit to the Commission a report on the application of
this Directive. Every five years the Commission shall present a report reviewing the application and effectiveness of this Directive,
accompanied, if necessary, by appropriate proposals.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 17.06.2014.
TRANSPOSITION: by 18.12.2015.
