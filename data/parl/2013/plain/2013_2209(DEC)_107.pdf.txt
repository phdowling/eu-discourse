In 2012, the tasks and budget of this agency were as follows:

2013/2209(DEC) - 10/09/2013 Court of Auditors: opinion, report

PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the European Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) for the
financial year 2012, together with the Agencys reply.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit concerned, amongst others, the annual accounts of the European Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA).
In the Courts opinion, the Agencys Annual Accounts fairly present, in all material respects, its financial position as of 31 December 2012 and
the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions of its financial rules and the
accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
The Court also considers that the transactions underlying the annual accounts of the Agency for the financial year ended 31 December 2012
are, in all material respects, legal and regular.
The report confirms that the resources made available for the Agency in 2012 amounted to EUR 20.4 million.
The report also makes a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of the Agency, accompanied by the latters
response. The main observations may be summarised as follows:
The Courts observations:
legality of transactions: in 2012, the Agency procured cleaning services via cascading framework contracts to two suppliers. Due to a
clerical error during the evaluation of offers, the ranking of the contractors was incorrect. Following the Courts audit, the Agency has
amended the ranking of the contractors accordingly;
budgetary management: budget implementation for operational expenditure was low.
The Agencys replies:
legality of transactions: the Agency stated that it corrected the clerical error in the evaluation of the offers and amended the framework
contract accordingly, with the agreement of all parties involved. Moreover, the Agency is in the process of enhancing its tender and
contract manager (TCM) software, which will eliminate such clerical errors in the future. Upon a request from the Commission, the
Agency has agreed to provide this software to the Commission services through a service level agreement;
budgetary management: in order to further improve its efficiency, the Agency has adopted a budgetary planning module (Budget
Module) that is linked directly to the Annual Work Programme. The carry overs represent payment appropriations needed to cover
existing legal commitments.
Lastly, the Court of Auditors report contains a summary of the Agencys activities in 2012. This is focused on the following:
various activities in the framework of the RAXEN network (European Information Network on Racism and Xenophobia and FRALEX
(legal experts network);
publication of reports and research;
conferences and events;
meetings with Member States and European and international institutions.

2013/2209(DEC) - 20/03/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Petri SARVAMAA (EPP, FI) on discharge in respect of the implementation of the
budget of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights for the financial year 2012, and called on the European Parliament to grant the
Director of the Agency discharge in respect of the implementation of the Agencys budget for the financial year 2012.
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the Agency for the financial
year 2012 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Members approved the closure of the Agencys accounts.
They made, however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is granted, in addition to the
general recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies.
·

Financing, budget and financial management: Members recalled that the budget of the Agency for the financial year 2012 was EUR
20. 376 million. They noted that budget monitoring efforts during the financial year 2012 resulted in a budget implementation rate of
100 %; notes that the payment appropriations execution rate was 78.5 %. Budget implementation for operational expenditure was
low at 49 % of committed appropriations, due to the multiannual nature of certain activities.

·

Legality and regularity of operations: Members were concerned that in 2012, the Agency procured cleaning services via cascading
framework contracts to two suppliers and due to a clerical error during the evaluation of offers, the ranking of the contractors was
incorrect. They acknowledged that following the Court of Auditors audit, the Agency has amended the ranking of the contractors
accordingly.

·

Carryovers: the report commended the Agency for adhering to the principle of annuality and for the timely execution of its budget.

Members also made a series of observations on transfers, procurement and recruitment procedures as well as comments on internal controls.
Lastly, they acknowledged that the Agency would review its policy on the prevention and management of conflicts of interests on the basis of
the Commission's Guidelines on the Prevention and Management of Conflict of Interest in EU Decentralised Agencies. They called on the
Agency to inform the discharge authority on the assessment results once available.
