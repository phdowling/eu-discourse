2013/0267B(NLE) - 31/01/2014 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude a Framework Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, on the one part, and South Korea, on
the other part, with the exception of matters related to readmission.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: in accordance with the Council Decision of 10 May 2010, the Framework Agreement between the European Union and its
Member States, on the one part, and the Republic of Korea, on the other part, was signed on 10 May 2010, subject to its conclusion at a later
date.
Certain provisions of the Agreement concern readmission, and therefore fall within the scope of Title V of Part Three of the Treaty on the
Functioning of the European Union. A separate Decision relating to those provisions, which are contained in Article 33(2) of the Agreement,
will be adopted in parallel to this Decision.
The Agreement should be approved on behalf of the Union.
LEGAL BASIS: Articles 91, 100, 191(4), 207 and 212, in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European
Union (TFEU).

CONTENT: under this proposal, the Council is invited to approve, on behalf of the European Union, the draft Framework Agreement between
the European Union and its Member States, on the one part, and South Korea, on the other part, with the exception of matters related to
readmission.
The new Framework Agreement will allow the EU to assume greater responsibility and influence in the Korean Peninsula. By virtue of the new
Framework Agreement, the EU will promote European values and enhance concrete cooperation in a wide range of areas of mutual interest.
Specific provisions: the proposed Framework Agreement, with the exception of Article 33(2) thereof, is hereby approved on behalf of the
Union.
The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy shall chair the Joint Committee provided for the Agreement. The
Union or, as the case may be, the Union and the Member States, shall be represented in the Joint Committee depending on the subject
matter.
For further details as regards the main provisions of the draft Agreement and its impact on the EU budget, please refer to the summary of the
Commission initial legislative proposal dated 25/07/2013.

2013/0267B(NLE) - 03/04/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Foreign Affairs unanimously adopted the report by Norica NICOLAI (ADLE, RO) on the draft Council decision on the

2013/0267B(NLE) - 12/05/2014 Final act
PURPOSE: to conclude a Framework Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of
Korea, of the other part.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Council Decision 2014/278/EU on the conclusion of the Framework Agreement between the European Union and its
Member States, on the one part, and the Republic of Korea, on the other part, with the exception of matters related to readmission.
BACKGROUND: in accordance with the Council Decision of 2013/40/EU, the Framework Agreement between the European Union and its
Member States, on the one part, and the Republic of Korea, on the other part, was signed on 10 May 2010, subject to its conclusion at a later
date.
Certain provisions of the Agreement concern readmission, and therefore fall within the scope of Title V of Part Three of the Treaty on the
Functioning of the European Union. A separate Decision relating to those provisions, which are contained in Article 33(2) of the Agreement,
will be adopted in parallel to this Decision.
It is now appropriate to conclude the agreement on behalf of the European Union.
CONTENT: by means of this decision, the Council approves on behalf of the European Union, with the consent of the European Parliament,
the Framework Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, on the one part, and the Republic of Korea, on the other part,
with the exception of its Article 33 (2).
Shared principles: the new Framework Agreement is a testimony to the importance of EU-Korean ties and opens a new era in bilateral
relations, based on shared principles such as:
·

equality,

·

mutual respect, mutual benefit,

·

respect for democracy, rule of law and human rights.

Strengthened cooperation: the Agreement strengthens political, economic and sectoral cooperation across a wide range of policy fields,
including:
·

peace and security,

·

conflict prevention and crisis management,

·

trade,

·

environment,

·

energy,

·

science and technology,

·

good governance,

·

tourism and culture,

·

counter terrorism,

·

the fight against corruption and organised crime.

It will further enhance cooperation on responding to global challenges, where both Korea and the EU are playing an increasingly important
role, such as in the G20.
The conclusion of the new Framework Agreement is in line with the EU's objective of creating a comprehensive and coherent economic and
political framework for relations between the EU and ASEAN countries.
Institutional aspects: it is envisaged to establish a Joint Committee consisting of representatives of the members of the Council of the
European Union and representatives of the European Commission, on the one hand, and representatives of the Korea, on the other.
The Joint Committee shall be responsible for ensuring the good functioning of the Agreement.
The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy shall chair the Joint Committee provided for in the Agreement.
The Union or, as the case may be, the Union and the Member States, shall be represented in the Joint Committee depending on the subject
matter.
Modalities for implementation: implementation is covered by consensus and dialogue. If, however, there is divergence of views in the
application or interpretation of this Agreement, either Party shall refer to the Joint Committee. If either Party considers that the other Party has
failed to fulfil its obligations under this Agreement, it may take appropriate measures in accordance with international law, having given prior
notice to the Joint Committee of the reasons for the divergence and the possible modalities for mediation. In the selection of measures, priority
must be given to those which least disrupt the functioning of the agreement.
Measures are also envisaged so that Parties may request arbitration in the event of a dispute.
Duration of the agreement: the Framework Agreement is concluded for an indefinite period.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: the decision enters into force on 12.05.2014. The date of the entry into force of the agreement will be published in the
Official Journal of the European Union by the General Secretariat of the Council.
