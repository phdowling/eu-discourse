OJ L 054 22.02.2014, p. 0001 Summary

2013/0102(NLE) - 09/04/2013 Initial legislative proposal
PURPOSE : to conclude a new Protocol between the European Union and the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire setting out the fishing opportunities
and financial contribution provided for in the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the two Parties currently in force.
PROPOSED ACT : Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT : Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND : on the basis of powers conferred on it by the Council, the European Commission has conducted negotiations with the
Republic of Côte d'Ivoire with a view to renewing the Protocol to the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and
the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire. At the end of those negotiations, a new draft Protocol was initialled by the negotiators on 9 January 2013 which
is now necessary to be concluded on behalf of the European Union.
IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the interested parties were consulted during the evaluation of the Protocol for the period 2007-13. Experts from the
Member States were also consulted in technical meetings. These consultations concluded that it would be beneficial to maintain a fishing

protocol with the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire.
LEGAL BASIS : Article 43(2), in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
CONTENT : this draft Decision seeks to conclude a new Protocol between the European Union and the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire setting out
the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the two Parties.
Aim: the general aim is to enhance the cooperation between the European Union and the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire, thereby creating a
partnership framework within which to develop a sustainable fisheries policy and sound exploitation of fishery resources in the Ivorian fishing
zone, in the interests of both Parties.
Protocol: more particularly, the Protocol provides for fishing opportunities in the following categories:
- fishing opportunities :
28 freezer tuna seiners,
10 surface longliners.
- financial contribution : the financial contribution shall be EUR 680 000 for the entire period.
This amount comprises:
an annual amount of EUR 422 500 for access to the Ivorian fishing zone equivalent to a reference tonnage of de 6 500 tonnes per
year;
a specific amount of EUR 257 500 per year for the support and implementation of the Ivorian sectoral fisheries policy. This support
meets the objectives of the national fisheries policy and in particular the needs of the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire in the fight against
illegal fishing.
The annual financial contribution of EUR 680 000 is based on a reference tonnage. If the overall quantity of catches by EU vessels in the
Ivorian fishing zone exceeds the reference tonnage, the amount of the annual financial contribution shall be increased by EUR 65 for each
additional tonne caught. However, the total annual amount paid by the Union shall not be more than twice the amount indicated in the Protocol
(EUR 422 500 x2).
Review of fishing opportunities by mutual agreement : the fishing opportunities may be increased by mutual agreement provided that the
consultations confirm that such an increase will not endanger the sustainable management of the resources of the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire. In
this case the financial contribution shall be increased proportionately and pro rata temporis.
Conversely, if the parties agree to adopt a reduction in the fishing opportunities, the financial contribution shall be reduced proportionately and
pro rata temporis.
Should EU vessels be interested in fishing activities which are not indicated in the Protocol, the European Union shall consult the Republic of
Côte d'Ivoire in order to seek autorisation for these new activities. In the course of these consultations, the parties shall take account of the
relevant scientific opinions, in particular opinions issued by regional fisheries organisations such as the Fishery Committee for the Eastern
Central Atlantic (CECAF).
Duration of the Protocol : the new Protocol covers a period of five years from 1 July 2013.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATION : the total amount allocated to the Protocol shall be EUR 3.4 million from 2013 to 2017 (operational
appropriations) + administrative appropriations of an administrative nature financed from the envelope of specific programmes for a total
amount of EUR 185 000. EUR 345 000 for human resources and other administrative expenditure shall be added to the total amount for the
whole period of the Protocol.
