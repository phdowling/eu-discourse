2013/0812(COD) - 18/11/2013 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to establish a new seat of the European Police College (CEPOL) in Hungary.
BACKGROUND: according to Article 4 of Council Decision 2005/681/JHA establishing the European Police College (CEPOL), CEPOL has its
seat in Bramshill, United Kingdom.
By letters of 12 December 2012 and 8 February 2013, the United Kingdom informed CEPOL that it no longer wishes to host the seat on its
territory. Apart from hosting CEPOL, Bramshill also hosts a national police training site of the National Policing Improvement Agency which the
United Kingdom decided to replace by a new College of Policing to be located elsewhere.
The United Kingdom has therefore decided to close the national police training site at Bramshill and to sell the site indicating that the related
costs were high and no alternative business model to run the site had emerged.
In view of this situation, on 8 October 2013, the Council agreed by common accord on arrangements to host CEPOL according to which
CEPOL will be hosted in Budapest as soon as it moves from Bramshill.
This agreement should be incorporated in Council Decision 2005/681/JHA.
IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment of locating CEPOL seat in Budapest demonstrates that the proposal complies with the

pertinent criteria, allowing the European Parliament and the Council to assess the impact of the relocation and the functioning of CEPOL in
Budapest.
The assessment addresses those factors in detail that:
have a financial impact on the general budget of the European Union and
cover social aspects of the work of CEPOL staff members.
Moreover, the headquarters offered by Hungary for the purposes of the seat of the CEPOL are situated in the city centre of Budapest. Due to
the central location of Budapest, it is easily accessible from most European capitals by cost-effective flights.
The building proposed satisfies the requirements laid down by Secretariat of CEPOL. Hungary also proposes to offer, free of charge, a number
of services and installations.
LEGAL BASIS: Article 87(2)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
CONTENT: this proposal seeks to amend Article 4 of Council Decision 2005/681/JHA and proposes the new seat of CEPOL to be established
in Budapest, Hungary.
The specific budgetary implications of the proposal relate to estimated savings in CEPOLs functioning costs per year due to the proposed
relocation from Bramshill to Budapest as well as an estimated tentative budgetary calculation of the one-off expenditure of the relocation. The
savings amount to EUR 203 500/year. The estimated tentative budgetary calculation of the one-off expenditure for relocating CEPOL from
Bramshill to Budapest amounts to EUR 1 875 449.

2013/0812(COD) - 16/01/2014 Document attached to the procedure
In its opinion on the initiative for a Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council amending Decision 2005/681/JHA establishing the
European Police College (CEPOL), the Commission recalled that the text is a legal translation of the political agreement reached by the JHA
Council on 8 October 2013 to provisionally relocate the seat of CEPOL from Bramshill (UK) to Budapest (HU) , further to the announcement by
the United Kingdom in December 2012 of its decision to close the Bramshill site in 2014.
The choice of Budapest as a new CEPOL provisional location was made by a specific voting arrangement proposed by the Presidency and
accepted by the Member States, during the JHA Council lunch on 8 October. It was based on the 7 applications submitted by Ireland, Greece,
Spain, Italy, Hungary, The Netherlands and Finland.
Commissions opinion: the Commission noted that the draft Regulation amending the CEPOL Decision does not refer to the provisional
relocation of the seat of CEPOL and therefore it does not implement the abovementioned political agreement, but goes much further.
In that regard, the Member States' initiative is in direct opposition to the Commission's proposal for the Europol Regulation, including the
merger of CEPOL into Europol, which has been and remains on the table since 27 March 2013. The Commission's proposal is driven by the
aim of addressing, in a comprehensive manner, ways to improve effectiveness in police cooperation and training. It is designed to achieve
functional synergies and cost savings. This is why the issue of CEPOL's seat should not be considered in isolation from this broader context of
a functional and operational reform that would match the goals of rationalisation and operational improvement for both agencies. The
Commission further noted the adverse budgetary effects of a double move and notes that the necessary additional funding would need to
come from the existing budget envelope, which means that those funds could not be used for other purposes.
The Commission therefore gave a negative opinion to the Member States' initiative. In addition, it invited the European Parliament and the
Council to avoid any adverse budgetary effects of a solution that would not achieve functional synergies and cost savings and would not be in
line with the recommendations set out in the Common Approach on decentralised agencies endorsed by the three institutions.
Should this Initiative be pursued, the Commission would be obliged to make a Declaration, at the time of its adoption, on the provisional nature
of this Regulation, its adverse budgetary effects and the necessity of not prejudging the outcome of discussions on the Commission's own
Proposal. In that regard, the Commission encourages the European Parliament and the
Council to build on the constructive progress that is being made on its proposal to reform Europols legal framework while reflecting on an
alternative solution to co-locate CEPOL and
Europol that would match the goals of rationalisation and operational improvement for both agencies.

2013/0812(COD) - 27/02/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs adopted the report by Kinga GÁL (EPP, HU) on the draft regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council amending Decision 2005/681/JHA establishing the European Police College (CEPOL).
In the draft legislative resolution, Members regretted that the European Parliament was not fully involved in the evaluation of the applications
and that only one candidate was presented to the relevant committee, although seven applications had been submitted from Ireland, Greece,
Spain, Italy, Hungary, the Netherlands and Finland.
Members also noted that the political agreement was confirmed at the JHA Council meeting of 8 October 2013. They stated their intent to
request more information on the impact assessment of the exact location before calling on Parliament to take its final position. They called on
the budgetary authorities to ensure that the additional costs relating to the change in the seat of CEPOL would be fully covered by the United
Kingdom and by additional Union budget and thus will not adversely affect the regular budget of CEPOL so as not to jeopardise the normal
operational needs of CEPOL.
The committee recommended that Parliaments position in first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure should amend the
Commission position as follows:

Unilateral decision by the United Kingdom concerning CEPOL: whilst respecting the United Kingdoms position in not wishing to host CEPOL,
Members considered that the principle of loyal cooperation set out in the Treaty and particularly, the obligation in Article 4 TEU to 'take any
appropriate measure to ensure fulfilment of the obligations resulting from the acts of the institutions of the Union', required the UK government
to ensure a smooth transition of CEPOL to its new location, without jeopardising the regular budget of CEPOL.
Temporary seat : Members also stressed that the seat of CEPOL is only temporarily to be in Budapest, Hungary. They stated that before
CEPOL starts its operational phase at the new location, a headquarters agreement should be concluded, based on a set of
provisions provided by the Commission.
Ordinary legislative procedure: the committee went on to indicate that the decision to relocate CEPOL needed to be taken in the framework of
the ordinary legislative procedure, whereby Parliament and Council were equal as co-legislators. The political decision that Council took on 8
October concerning Council's preference for the new CEPOL seat did not have any binding force on Parliament and therefore should not be
mentioned in the final text agreed by both Institutions.
Members also wanted the new Commission to propose an updated and revised framework for CEPOL.
Evaluation: the committee asked that the Commission evaluate, not later than 18 months after the entry into force of the Regulation, the
effectiveness of Decision 2005/681/JHA in the light of the provisions of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union governing
CEPOL, as well as the new tasks envisaged for CEPOL in the Commission Communication of 27 March 2013 entitled 'Establishing a
European Law Enforcement Training Scheme' and if appropriate issue legislative proposals to amend Decision 2005/681/JHA, while at the
same time ensuring CEPOL's complete independence.
Review: lastly, Members asked the Commission to review the Regulation by 2019 at the latest, including by performing a thorough cost-benefit
analysis and impact assessment of all possible options, and if appropriate table legislative proposals to amend it, while fully respecting the
fundamental need to maintain CEPOL's complete independence.
It should be noted that in a minority opinion, some Members voted against the proposal to move Cepol to Budapest, feeling that such a
decision, taken unilaterally by a Member State, could create a dangerous institutional precedent in the EU in relation to the location of bodies
and agencies.

2013/0812(COD) - 16/04/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 321 votes to 230, with 18 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the draft regulation of the European
Parliament and of the Council amending Decision 2005/681/JHA establishing the European Police College (CEPOL).
The resolution regretted that the European Parliament was not fully involved in the evaluation of the applications and that only one candidate
was presented to the relevant committee, although seven applications had been submitted further to the Council Presidency's call in July 2013
for applications to provisionally host the European Police College. Submitting candidatures were Ireland, Greece, Spain, Italy, Hungary, the
Netherlands and Finland.
The political agreement was confirmed at the JHA Council meeting of 8 October 2013. It intended to request more information on the impact
assessment of the exact location before taking its final position.
The resolution called on the budgetary authorities to ensure that the additional costs relating to the change in the seat of CEPOL will be fully
covered by the current host country and by additional Union budget and thus will not adversely affect the regular budget of CEPOL so as not
to jeopardise the normal operational needs of CEPOL.
In parallel, Parliament adopted its position at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure. The amendments adopted in plenary are
the result of an agreement reached between the European Parliament and the Council. They amended the proposal as follows:
Unilateral decision by the United Kingdom on CEPOL: the United Kingdom informed CEPOL that it had unilaterally decided that it no longer
wished to host the seat on its territory. In addition to hosting CEPOL, Bramshill also hosts a national police training site of the National Policing
Improvement Agency, which the United Kingdom had decided to replace by a new College of Policing to be located elsewhere. The United
Kingdom had therefore decided to close the national police training site at Bramshill and to sell the site, indicating that the related costs were
high and that no alternative business model to run the site had emerged. The Union and its Member States should mutually assist each other
in maintaining CEPOL's operational activities. To that end, the United Kingdom in particular is required to ensure a smooth transition of
CEPOL to its new location, without jeopardising the regular budget of CEPOL.
Seat: the draft Regulation stipulated that the seat of CEPOL should be in Budapest, Hungary.
Review: by 18 months following the entry into force of the Regulation, the Commission should submit a report on the effectiveness of this
Decision, taking into account the need to ensure CEPOL's status as a separate Union agency. That report should, if appropriate, be
accompanied by a legislative proposal to amend this Decision following a thorough cost-benefit analysis and impact assessment.
Entry into force: the Regulation should apply from 1 September 2014.

2013/0812(COD) - 15/05/2014 Final act
PURPOSE: to establish the seat of CEPOL in Budapest (HU).
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Regulation (EU) No 543/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Decision 2005/681/JHA
establishing the European Police College (CEPOL).
BACKGROUND: pursuant to Article 4 of Council Decision 2005/681/JHA, CEPOL has its seat in Bramshill, United Kingdom.
By letters dated 12 December 2012 and 8 February 2013, the United Kingdom informed CEPOL that it had unilaterally decided that it no
longer wished to host the seat on its territory. In addition to hosting CEPOL, Bramshill also hosts a national police training site of the National

Policing Improvement Agency, which the United Kingdom had decided to replace by a new College of Policing to be located elsewhere. The
United Kingdom had therefore decided to close the national police training site at Bramshill and to sell the site, indicating that the related costs
were high and that no alternative business model to run the site had emerged.
In the light of the obligation of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) of sincere cooperation, and in particular the obligations deriving from
Article 4 TEU, the Union and its Member States should mutually assist each other in maintaining CEPOL's operational activities. To that end,
the United Kingdom in particular is required to ensure a smooth transition of CEPOL to its new location, without jeopardising the regular
budget of CEPOL.
In view of the common accord reached on 8 October 2013 by the representatives of the Governments of the Member States, and of the need
to maintain CEPOL's status as a separate Union agency, arrangements should be made according to which CEPOL will be hosted in
Budapest as soon as it leaves Bramshill.
This agreement should be incorporated in Council Decision 2005/681/JHA
CONTENT: under this Regulation, it is provided to amend Article 4 of Council Decision 2005/681/JHA and to establish the new seat of CEPOL
in Budapest, Hungary.
Review: by 30 November 2015, the Commission shall submit a report on the effectiveness of this Decision, taking into account the need to
ensure CEPOL's status as a separate Union agency. That report shall, if appropriate, be accompanied by a legislative proposal to amend this
Decision following a thorough cost-benefit analysis and impact assessment.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 29.05.2014. The Regulation shall apply from 1 September 2014.
