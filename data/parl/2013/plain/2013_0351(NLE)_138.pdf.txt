2013/0351(NLE) - 25/10/2013 Initial legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to extend the Agreement on cooperation in science and technology between the European Community and the United States of
America.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: the Agreement on cooperation in science and technology between the European Community and the Government of the
United States of America was signed in Washington on 5 December 1997 and entered into force on 14 October 1998.
Article 12(b) of the Agreement provides that this Agreement may be extended with possible amendments, thereafter for additional period of
five years by mutual written agreement by the Parties.
By Council Decision 2009/306/EC of 30 March 2009, the Agreement was extended for a further period of five years. The Agreement is due to
expire on 14 October 2013.
Extension of the Agreement would be in the interest of both Parties so as to maintain continuity in the scientific and technological relations
between the US and the European Union leading to socio-economic benefits for both Parties.
It is now necessary to extend this Agreement.
CONTENT: under this present proposal, it is provided to invite the Council to approve the extension of the Agreement for scientific and
technological cooperation between the European Community and the Government of the United States of America for an additional period of
five years.
The material content of the extended Agreement will be identical to that of the current Agreement.
At a later stage, however, the intellectual property rights annex may be reviewed following a request from the United States. The USA is
preparing an official note identifying all the areas which they would like to negotiate. Such negotiations will require the Council to adopt a
decision authorising the opening of negotiations upon the Commission's recommendation.
In the meantime, the current draft Agreement shall remain applicable.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the financial impact of the Agreement would cover the period 2013-2018 and includes a financial envelope
estimated at EUR 875 000 from the EU budget (mainly appropriations from the DG Research).
