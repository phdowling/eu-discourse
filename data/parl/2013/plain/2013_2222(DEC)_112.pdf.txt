PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the European Network and Information Security Agency
(ENISA) for the year 2012, together with the Agencys reply.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit concerned, amongst others, the annual accounts of the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA).
In the Courts opinion, ENISAs Annual Accounts fairly present, in all material respects, its financial position as of 31 December 2012 and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions of its Financial Regulation and the
accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
The Court also considers that the transactions underlying the annual accounts of the Agency for the financial year ended 31 December 2012
are, in all material respects, legal and regular.
The report confirms that the Agencys 2012 budget amounted to EUR 8.2 million.
The report also makes a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of the Agency, accompanied by the latters
response. The main observations may be summarised as follows:
The Courts observations:
Internal controls: whereas the Financial Regulation and the corresponding Implementing Rules provide for a physical inventory of fixed
assets at least every three years, the Agency has not carried out a comprehensive physical inventory since 2009.
The Agencys reply:
Controls: ENISA states that it launched the inventory count in late April 2013 in both offices, in Heraklion and Athens. This is the first
count in the history of ENISA which occurs with the use of a dedicated electronic tool, ABAC Assets, and its functionalities (including
labelling, scanning, uploading of scanned items, providing reports). The results of the count will be processed by the Accounting
Officer and the final accounting entries for the differences between the accounting records and the physical inventory will occur by 31
July 2013 the latest.
Lastly, the Court of Auditors report contains a summary of the Agencys activities in 2012. This is focused on the following:
identifying and responding to the evolving threat environment ;
assisting Member States to increase the level of protection of critical information infrastructures;
supporting the CERT and other operational communities ;
securing the digital economy.

The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Petri SARVAMAA (EPP, FI) in which it recommended the European Parliament to
grant discharge to the Executive Director of the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) in respect of the implementation
of the Agency's budget for the financial year 2012.

year 2012 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Members approved the closure of ENISAs accounts. They
made, however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is granted, in addition to the general
recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies.
Budget and financial management: Members noted with satisfaction that budget monitoring efforts during the financial year 2012
resulted in a budget implementation rate of 100% and that the payment appropriations execution rate was 91.45%.
Prevention and management of conflicts of interests and transparency: Members stated that the Management Board approved and
signed the decision on practical arrangements for implementing transparency and confidentiality rules in October 2013.
Lastly, Members also made a series of observations on transfers, procurement and recruitment procedures as well as comments on internal
