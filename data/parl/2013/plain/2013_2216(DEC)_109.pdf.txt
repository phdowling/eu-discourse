Analysis of the accounts of EUROJUST.
CONTENT: this Commission document sets out the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2012 as
prepared on the basis of the information presented by the institutions, organisations and bodies of the EU, in accordance with Article 129 (2) of
the Financial Regulation applicable to the EU's General Budget, including Eurojust.
In 2012, the tasks and budget of this agency were as follows:
description of Eurojust's tasks: Eurojust, which is located in The Hague, was set up by Council Decision 2002/187/JHA with a view to
stepping up the fight against serious organised crime. Its objective are: (i) to stimulate and improve coordination between the
competent authorities of Member States, of investigations and prosecutions in the Member States; (ii) facilitate the execution of
requests for, and decisions on, judicial cooperation; (iii) to strengthen the effectiveness of investigations and prosecutions in Member
States.
Eurojust's budget for the 2012 financial year: Eurojusts budget for 2012, as presented in the Commission document on the
consolidated annual accounts of the European Union, gives the following figures:
§

- committed : EUR 35 million;
- paid : EUR 34 million;
- carried over : EUR 1 million.

§

Payment appropriations:

2013/2216(DEC) - 10/09/2013 Court of Auditors: opinion, report
PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of EUROJUST for the financial year 2012, together with
the Eurojusts replies.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit concerned, amongst others, the annual accounts of EUROJUST.
In the Courts opinion, EUROJUSTs Annual Accounts fairly present, in all material respects, its financial position as of 31 December 2012 and
the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions of its financial rules and the
accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
The Court also considers that the transactions underlying the annual accounts of EUROJUST for the financial year ended 31 December 2012
are, in all material respects, legal and regular.
The report confirms that the resources made available to EUROJUST in 2012 amounted to EUR 33.3 million.
The report also makes a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of EUROJUST, accompanied by the latters
response. The main observations may be summarised as follows:
The Courts observations:
legality of transactions: a framework contract for security services was signed in 2008 and amended in 2009. The amended formula to
calculate prices increased them progressively up to 22 %, whereas the original framework contract had provided for a maximum
increase of 4 %. The total price increase above the 4 % ceiling amounted to some 440 000 euro for the 2008 to 2012 period, of which
some 68 000 euro were paid in 2012. Such a significant increase may undermine the transparency and fairness of the initial
procurement procedure and distort competition.
recruitment procedures: the Court noted that there is room to improve the transparency of recruitment procedures.
Eurojusts replies:
legality of transactions: Eurojust accepts the fact that retroactive price increases above what is agreed in the contract could undermine
the transparency and fairness of the initial procurement procedure and distort competition. The increase in the case at hand was
based on changes in the Dutch Collective Labour Agreement and thus would have affected all other competitors offering their services
on the territory of the Netherlands equally.
Lastly, the Court of Auditors report contains a summary of the Eurojusts activities in 2012. This is focused on the following:
organisation of coordination meetings;
1533 cases dealt with in the areas of fraud, drug trafficking, terrorism, murder, trafficking in human beings.

2013/2216(DEC) - 20/03/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Petri SARVAMAA (EPP, FI) on discharge in respect of the implementation of the
budget of Eurojust for the financial year 2012, and called on the European Parliament to grant the Administrative Director of Eurojust discharge
in respect of the implementation of Eurojusts budget for the financial year 2012.
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it had obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of Eurojust for the financial year
2012 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Members approved the closure of Eurojusts accounts. They
made, however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is granted, in addition to the general
recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies.
·

Financing, budget and financial management: Members recalled that the budget of Eurojust for the financial year 2012 was EUR
33.33 million.

·

Legality and regularity of operations: Members were concerned that a framework contract for security services was signed in 2008
and amended in 2009, and that the amended formula to calculate prices progressively increased them by 22 %, whereas the original
framework contract had provided for a maximum increase of 4 %. They expressed concern that such a significant increase may
undermine the transparency and fairness of the initial procurement procedure and distort competition.

·

Rate of implementation and carryovers: they acknowledged that the Court of Auditors' annual audit had found no notable issues as
regards the level of carry-overs in 2012, and commended Eurojust for adhering to the principle of annuality and for the timely
execution of its budget.

Members also made a series of observations ontransfers, procurement and recruitment procedures as well as comments on internal controls.
Lastly, they asked Eurojust to strengthen transparency and prevent conflicts of interests, as well as make publicly available the Declarations of
Interests of certain members.
