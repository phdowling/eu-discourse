Summary

2013/2621(RSP) - 23/10/2013 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a resolution tabled by the Committee on Foreign Affairs on the European Neighbourhood Policy: towards a
strengthening of the partnership. Position of the European Parliament on the 2012 reports.
Whilst welcoming the publication of the 2012 progress reports for the ENP South and Eastern countries, Parliament regretted that, in most
cases, the reports presented a mixed picture of progress, stagnation and regression. They described the national situation without evaluating
the programmes carried out by the Union or making concrete recommendations regarding the allocation of funds under the EU external
instruments or development cooperation assistance and its influence on policy-making in the partner countries. The reports should also assess
trends by containing data for previous years.
Involvement of Parliament: Members strongly believed that Parliament should be fully involved in implementing the new ENP and in adjusting
EU financial support, notably through delegated acts, and should be kept regularly informed about progress in the implementation of reforms in
the partner countries and resulting adjustments. They deplored the fact that Parliament was not always consulted when action plans are drawn
up or informed about the tenor of discussions, and they called for the status of observer to be accorded to MEPs to take part in meetings of
policy and human rights subcommittees.
More for more principle: Parliament called for the consistent implementation of the incentive-based and differentiated approaches and of the
principle of more for more as the cornerstone of the revised ENP. It also called for less for less if necessary for those ENP countries making
insufficient efforts to build a deep and sustainable democracy and to undertake the agreed reforms.
Democratic transition: Members stressed the need to support the democratic transition processes and that freedom of expression, pluralism
and media independence are cornerstones of democracy. They called on the Commission and the EEAS to continue and, wherever possible,
to reinforce their support for the democratic conduct of upcoming elections in the partner countries, including the strengthening of media
freedom and pluralism.
Eastern Partnership: Parliament made a series of recommendations, stating that the EU should, inter alia:
·

strengthen the application of the more-for-more principle and stimulate it by positive competition and cooperation among partner
countries, expressing necessary support to EaP states facing pressure from third countries when implementing the acquis
communautaire ;

·

apply a two-track approach, by making demands of EaP governments whilst being open, generous and engaging towards the
citizens of partner countries;

·

design a long-march strategy to promote European values encompassing internal change and the aspirations of these societies for
freedom and prosperity;

·

decentralise the EaP by engaging with, and offering its ownership to, public actors on both sides through horizontal partnerships and
twinning, accompanied by increased mobility, people-to-people contacts, visa facilitation and the prospect of a visa-free system,

·

initial or sign the Association Agreements and aim for their prompt entry into force, initially on a provisional basis and then in full,
before the end of the current term of the European Parliament and the European Commission, provided that the necessary
conditions and requirements have been met.

Parliament started its concern about Russian actions designed to deter partner countries from political and economic association with the EU.
It went on to make a series of specific remarks about partner countries, these being: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, and
Ukraine. Regarding the latter, Members recommended that the Council sign the Association Agreement between the EU and Ukraine if the
conditions are met.
The Southern Neighbourhood: Parliament was concerned at the difficulties being encountered by the southern Mediterranean countries in
overcoming the challenges of their democratic transitions, taking the view that a successful transition to sustainable democracy must be the
Unions priority regarding its Southern Neighbourhood, and calling for the EU institutions and the Member States to increase their support to
that effect.
Members pointed out that social justice and improving the quality of life are key elements of the transitions currently taking place in the
Southern Neighbourhood countries, expressing deep concern at the employment situation, in particular among young people, and they urged
the Commission to support effective employment policies. They believed that there was an urgent need to promote projects for sustainable
and inclusive socio-economic development and integration in the Maghreb in order to facilitate the circulation of goods, services, capital and
persons. Furthermore, Parliament wanted the EU and its Member States to implement a concrete and effective mobility policy with the
countries of the Southern Neighbourhood, in particular by simultaneously signing visa liberalisation agreements and readmission agreements
similar to those signed with most countries of the Eastern Partnership, underlining the importance of increasing mobility and cooperation in the
field of academic education and vocational training.
Parliament went on to make a series of specific observations regarding Southern Neighbourhood partner countries, these being: Algeria,
Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Palestine, Syria and Tunisia.
