OJ L 065 11.03.2016, p. 0061 Summary

2013/0422(NLE) - 10/12/2013 Initial legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude the Arrangement with Switzerland on the modalities of its participation in the European Asylum Support Office.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 439/2010 established the European Asylum Support Office to strengthen practical cooperation between
Member States on asylum, enhance the implementation of the Common European Asylum System and support Member States whose asylum
and reception systems are under particular pressure.
Accordingly, Article 49 (1) of the Regulation stipulates that the Support Office shall be open to the participation of Iceland, Liechtenstein,
Norway and Switzerland as observers.
Arrangements shall be made, specifying in particular the nature, extent and manner in which those countries are to participate in the Support
Office's work.
The participation of associate countries in the Support Office's work is not only a logical step, having regard to their association to the Dublin
system, but also has a clear added value to the Support Office's support offer such as:
the exchange of best practices and expertise,
the Support Office's permanent and emergency support,
the Support Office's information gathering and analysis,
the Support Office's early warning and preparedness system.
On that basis the Commission presented on 1 July 2011, a recommendation to the Council in order to authorise the Commission to open
negotiations with Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein on international agreements establishing such arrangements.
The Commission received the Council authorisation to open negotiations with Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein on
arrangements on the modalities of these countries' participation in EASO on 27 January 2012.
The negotiations were held jointly with all associate countries. Four rounds of negotiations took place.
The final text of the draft Arrangement with Liechtenstein was initialled on 28 June 2013.
It is now necessary to approve the Arrangement on behalf of the European Union.
CONTENT: with this proposed Decision, the Council is called upon to approve, on behalf of the Union, the Arrangement with Switzerland on
the modalities of its participation in the European Asylum Support Office.
Main provisions of the Arrangement: the draft Arrangement foresees:
the full participation of Switzerland in the activities of the Support Office,
representation in the Support Office's Management Board as an observer and without voting rights,
annual financial contributions of Switzerland, to the budget of the Support Office by an annual sum calculated in accordance with its
GDP as a percentage of GDP of all States participating in the Support Office's work. Switzerland accepted provisions concerning a
possible increased contribution if the Union contribution is increased.
Institutional provisions: the draft Arrangement foresees the establishment of a committee composed of representatives of the Commission and
of the associate countries. For reasons of efficiency, this committee shall meet jointly with the corresponding Committees set up with other
associated countries participating on the basis of Article 49 (1) of the Regulation. The committee was not mentioned in the negotiating
directives and has been requested by the associate countries in order to allow for an exchange of information and monitor the proper
implementation of the Arrangement.
Financial contribution: Switzerland shall contribute to the revenue of the Support Office an annual sum calculated in accordance with its Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) as a percentage of the GDP of all participating States in accordance with the formula described in Annex I of the draft
Arrangement.
Staff of the Support Office: the Staff Regulations of the European Union should apply to nationals of Switzerland recruited as staff members by
the Support Office. Switzerland shall apply to the Support Office and to its staff the Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of the European
Union as well as any rules adopted pursuant to this Protocol relating to staff matters of the Support Office.

Under this Arrangement, Switzerland shall:
participate fully in the work of the Support Office and be entitled to receive support actions from the Support Office;

Arrangement and ensure a continuous process of information provision and exchange of views in this respect.
Ireland and the United Kingdom shall participate in this Decision while Denmark shall not take part nor shall it be bound by it or subject to its
application.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 25.2.2016.
