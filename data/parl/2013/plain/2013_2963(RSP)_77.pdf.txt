Summary

2013/2963(RSP) - 12/12/2013 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a resolution on the call for a measurable and tangible commitment against tax evasion and tax avoidance in
the EU. The resolution was tabled by the S&D, EPP, and ALDE groups. Noting that an estimated EUR 1 trillion in potential tax revenue was
lost to tax fraud, evasion and avoidance every year in the EU, without any tangible measures being taken in response, Parliament called on
Member States to commit to an ambitious but realistic target of at least halving the tax gap by 2020.
Members called on the Commission to:
路

introduce a set of tangible targets for reducing the tax gap at European and national level, with the headline target being the

reduction of the tax gap by 2020;
路

incorporate the targets into the Europe 2020 strategy, if appropriate, and examine whether they could be given a clear role within the
European Semester;

路

examine whether the national reform programmes and the stability and convergence programmes could be expanded by
incorporating these targets and measures, so as to achieve the required reduction in the tax gap;

路

launch a study on possible indicators constituting a basis for reducing tax fraud, evasion and avoidance and, if appropriate, to
establish a standardised set of indicators for measuring tax evasion and avoidance.

Parliament welcomed the recent Commission proposals to expand automatic information exchange, fight VAT fraud and amend the
Parent-Subsidiary Directive, which were designed to reduce tax avoidance in Europe by closing existing legal loopholes that some companies
have been using to escape paying their fair share of fiscal contributions. It stressed the urgent need for better coordination, and a common
drive to reduce the tax gap that would give substance to the Councils pledges of commitment to fighting tax evasion and avoidance.
Lastly, Members called on the Commission to report annually to Parliament and the Council on the progress made in the EU and globally in
fighting tax fraud and evasion and aggressive tax planning, and to publicise on its website concrete examples of best practices in this field.
