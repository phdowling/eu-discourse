Examination of delegated act

2013/0152(COD) - 23/05/2013 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to grant an EU guarantee to the European Investment Bank against losses under financing operations supporting investment
projects outside the Union.
PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: the European Union provides a budgetary guarantee to the European Investment Bank (EIB) covering risks of a sovereign
and political nature in connection with its financing operations carried out outside the Union in support of the Union's external policy objectives.
The EU guarantee has been the key instrument ensuring the compatibility between the EIB's financial structure and the significantly higher
inherent risk of lending to third countries, taking into account the need to avoid a deterioration of the Bank's AAA rating whilst limiting the EIB
capital consumption.
The overall scope and general conditions of the EU guarantee coverage for EIB external operations are set out in decisions of the European
Parliament and of the Council. The most recent decision covering the EIB financing operations outside the Union over the period beginning on
1 February 2007 and ending on 31 December 2013 was established by Decision No 1080/2011/EU of the European Parliament and of the
Council. It requires the Commission to present to the European Parliament and to the Council a proposal for establishing the EU guarantee
under the next multiannual financial framework.
The proposed new decision will cover the EU guarantee for EIB external financing operations over the period beginning on 1 January 2014
and ending on 31 December 2020.
IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option would be an adaptation of the current set-up of the existing mandate, with a combination of
amendments responding to the new policy context. The preferred option in terms of budgetary impact, coherence and complementarity with
the Union policies and instruments is the sub-option called FOCUS which involves:
focusing the mandate on less credit-worthy beneficiaries, microfinance operations continuing not to be explicitly eligible,
introducing an overall signature target accompanied by the introduction of a tracking system allowing to monitor absolute and relative
Greenhouse Gas emission reduction of all EIB projects supported under the mandate, and
updating technical operational regional guidelines in line with the multiannual indicative programming of EU external financial
instruments.
LEGAL BASIS: Articles 209 and 212 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
CONTENT: the proposal aims to ensure the continuation of the EU guarantee for EIB external financing for the next financial perspectives
2014-2020, whilst introducing some changes:
refocusingthe geographical scope of the mandate on less creditworthy beneficiaries where the use of the guarantee would display the
highest value added. The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts to activate or suspend the actual eligibility for EIB
financing under the EU guarantee for countries listed as potentially eligible countries, while the modification of the list of potentially
eligible countries would require a separate decision by the legislator;
reinforcing the climate change dimension of the mandate (climate change operations should represent an average of at least 25% of
total EIB financing operations);
betteraligning EIB financing with the Union policies and reinforcing coherence and complementarity with EU instruments to more
satisfactorily mirror policy developments in a timely manner through the provision to update the technical operational regional

guidelines in line with the multiannual indicative programming of EU external financial instruments.
BUDGETARY IMPLIACTION: the ceiling proposed is compatible with the provisioning amounts envisaged in the technical input from the
European Commission sent by the Commission on 27 March 2013 (EUR 1.193 billion for the 2014-2020 Financial Framework in current prices
) and is based on expected patterns of disbursements and reimbursements of guaranteed loans.
The proposal foresees a maximum ceiling of the EIB financing operations under EU guarantee throughout the period 2014-2020 of EUR 28
billion. This maximum ceiling shall be broken down into two parts: (i) a fixed ceiling of a maximum amount of EUR 25 billion; and (ii) an
optional additional amount of EUR 3 billion. The activation in whole or in part of this optional amount and its regional distribution will be
decided under ordinary legislative procedure following a mid-term review.
The total budgetary implication (including administrative expenditure) is estimated at EUR 1 119.488 million for the 2014-2020 period.
DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of
the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

2013/0152(COD) - 15/11/2013 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Budgets Committee adopted the report by Ivailo KALFIN (S&D, BG) on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the
Council on granting an EU guarantee to the European Investment Bank against losses under financing operations supporting investment
projects outside the Union.
It recommended that the European Parliaments position at first reading under the ordinary legislative procedure should be to amend the
Commission proposal as follows:
The EU guarantee: this should be given for the benefit of investment projects carried out in eligible countries in accordance with the EIB's own
rules and procedures including the EIB's statement on environmental and social principles and standards.
Ceilings for the financing operations: Members demanded that the maximum ceiling of the EIB financing operations under EU guarantee
throughout the period 2014-2020 should not exceed EUR 30 000 000 000 (against EUR 28 000 000 000 according to the Commission
proposal). This maximum limit should consist of a fixed ceiling of a maximum amount of EUR 27 000 000 000.
The EIB financing operations in support of Union external policies should continue to be conducted in accordance with the principles of sound
banking practices.
Objectives and general principles: the report indicated the following points:
the EIB should take care, in its choice of projects, to safeguard the European interest;
it should also be ensured that the foreign direct investment that is supported by the EIB genuinely contributes to economic integration
between Pre-accession countries, Neighbourhood countries and Member States;
in accordance with Article 208 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the EIB, in principle, should endeavour
to support the objectives of the Union development cooperation policy, such as reducing poverty through inclusive growth and
sustainable economy, environmental and social development;
the EIB should always, as a priority, endeavour to strengthen the local private sector in beneficiary countries; EIB financing should
genuinely be used in the specific investment projects for the benefit of the SMEs concerned;
the EIB should also support investment projects in sustainable energy security and energy infrastructure, including electricity
transmission infrastructure, in particular, interconnections that facilitate the integration of electricity from renewable sources;
investments in the field of renewable energy and better energy efficiency should be preferred to investment in fossil fuels which
generate high CO2 emissions;
financial agreements with individual promoters relating to EIB operations should also include appropriate environmental, social, human
rights and labour provisions.
Countries covered: for countries not listed in Annex II, eligibility for EIB financing under the EU guarantee should be decided on a
case-by-case basis in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure.
Members proposed adding Bhutan to Annex III following the recent developments which allowed the Union to open a new chapter in its
relations with this country and in order to support the on-going political and economic reforms.
Consistency between the external actions of the EIB and the objectives of the EUs external policy: Members demanded that the lending
operations of the EIB be consistent with the development strategies of the beneficiary country.
The EIB should also require the project promoters to carry out appropriate consultations with the relevant national and local stakeholders, as
well as with civil society, at project planning stage and implementation stage.
The consistency of EIB financing operations under the mandate with Union external policy objectives should be subject to monitoring. To
facilitate this, the EIB should develop performance indicators in relation to development, environmental and human rights aspects of projects
funded.
Cooperation with other European or international financial institutions: the EIB must not cooperate with financial intermediaries with a negative
track record in terms of transparency, fraud, corruption and environmental or social impacts.
Members took the view that the EIB should only cooperate with financial intermediaries:
that have substantial local ownership;
that are equipped to implement a predevelopment approach supporting the specificity of SMEs in the countries of operation;
and that are neither operating or established in a jurisdiction that: i) provides for tax measures which entail no or nominal taxes; ii)
does not ensure an effective exchange of information in tax matters; is listed as a Non-Cooperative Country or Territory by the
Financial Action Task Force (FATF).

Transparency: the allocation policy should be placed at the disposal of the European Parliament and made publicly available on the EIB
website. After the project approval stage, for each operation to be financed by the EIB outside of the EU, the EIB website should indicate
whether a EU guarantee will be used or not.

2013/0152(COD) - 11/03/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 593 votes to 63 with 18 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a decision of the
European Parliament and of the Council on granting an EU guarantee to the European Investment Bank against losses under financing
operations supporting investment projects outside the Union.
Parliament adopted its position in first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure. The amendments adopted in plenary are the result
of an agreement negotiated between Parliament and Council.
The EU guarantee: this should be given for the benefit of investment projects carried out in eligible countries in accordance with the EIB's own
rules and procedures including the EIB's statement on environmental and social principles and standards.
The EIB financing operations in support of Union external policies should continue to be conducted in accordance with the principles of sound
banking practice.
Ceilings for the financing operations: Parliament proposed that the maximum ceiling of the EIB financing operations under EU guarantee
throughout the period 2014-2020 should not exceed EUR 30 billion. This maximum limit should consist of a fixed ceiling of a maximum
amount of EUR 27 billion and an optional additional amount of EUR 3 billion.
The European Parliament and the Council shall decide in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on the activation in whole or in
part of the additional amount and its regional distribution following the mid-term review.
Objectives and general principles: the EU guarantee shall be granted only for EIB financing operations which have added value on the basis of
the EIB's own assessment, and support any of the following general objectives:
·

local private sector development, in particular support to SMEs;

·

development of social and economic infrastructure, including transport, energy, environmental infrastructure, and information and
communication technology;

·

climate change mitigation and adaptation.

Parliament specified the following:
·

EIB financing will be adapted to ensure that the EIB enables effective support of Union external policy objectives;

·

EIB financing operations should be consistent with the beneficiary country's own strategies;

·

the EIB shall undertake financing operations in beneficiary countries within areas covered by the general objectives by supporting
foreign direct investments that promote economic integration with the Union;

·

in developing countries, the EIB financing operations shall contribute indirectly to the objectives of the Union development
cooperation policy, such as reducing poverty through inclusive growth and sustainable economy, environmental and social
development ;

·

the EIB shall endeavour to strengthen the local private sector in beneficiary countries through support to local investment;

·

the EIB shall cooperate with financial intermediaries that can support the specific needs of SMEs in the countries of operation and
that do not participate in EIB financing operations implemented in an eligible country through vehicles located in a foreign
non-cooperative.

The EU guarantee shall cover only EIB financing operations carried out in eligible countries that have concluded a framework agreement with
the EIB establishing the legal conditions under which such operations are to be carried out.
Projects on climate change: the eligibility criteria for climate action projects are defined in the EIB climate change strategy, which shall be
updated before the end of 2015. To this end, an analysis of the carbon footprint ought to be included in the environmental assessment
procedure. The volume of those operations shall represent at least 25% of total EIB financing operations in order to further the promotion of
the Union's climate goals on a global scale.
Countries covered: for countries not listed in Annex II, eligibility for EIB financing under the EU guarantee should be decided on a
case-by-case basis in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure.
With regard to amendments to Annex III, the Commission's decisions shall be based on an overall assessment, including economic, social,
environmental and political aspects, in particular those related to the democracy, human rights and fundamental freedoms.
Coverage and terms of the EU guarantee: the amended text states that for EIB financing operations consisting of debt capital market
instruments, only the Political Risk Guarantee shall apply.
Furthermore, financing agreements with individual promoters relating to EIB financing operations shall also include appropriate environmental
and social provisions.
EIB assessment and monitoring of investment projects: the EIB shall require project promoters to carry out local public consultation, in line with
Union social and environmental principles, with the relevant national and local stakeholders, as well as with civil society, at project planning
stage and implementation stage on social, human rights, environmental, economic and development-related aspects of investment projects
covered by the EU guarantee.
Annual reporting and accounting: the report presented each year to the European Parliament and Council an assessment of the added value
, the estimated outputs, outcomes and development impact of EIB financing operations at an aggregated basis. To that effect, the EIB shall

use performance indicators in relation to development, environmental and social aspects, including human right aspects, of projects funded.
Indicators for environmental aspects of projects shall include criteria for clean technology which are oriented in principle at energy efficiency
and technologies for reducing emissions;
Transparency: the allocation policy and where possible and appropriate, existing framework agreements between the EIB and a recipient
country, should be made publicly available on the EIB website.

2013/0152(COD) - 16/04/2014 Final act

2013/0152(COD) - 14/09/2016 Follow-up document
Following the adoption of the Decision 466/2014/EU on granting an EU guarantee to the European Investment Bank (EIB) against losses
under EIB financing operations for projects outside the Union over 2014-2020, the Commission has presented this report covering the year
2015.
In brief, in the new Decision (466/2014/EU), the three high level objectives for extending the EU guarantee remain unchanged:
1. promoting growth in the local private sector,
2. developing social and economic infrastructure,
3. climate action and, as an underlying objective, fostering regional integration.
The Mandate entered into force with the signing of the Guarantee agreement on 25 July 2014.
Key findings from 2015:
- In terms of number of projects, financing for 38 projects was signed in 2015 under the EU Guarantee (42 in 2013) and 16 projects under EIB
own risk (23 projects signed in 2014).
- The share of activity under the EU guarantee in total volume increased in 2015 by 16% to reach EUR 4.8 billion (EUR 4.2 billion in 2014) or
72% of total 2015 financing in the regions covered by the Decision.
- The EIB signed a total of EUR 6.7 billion in the regions covered by the External Lending Mandate (ELM) which is almost equal to the
signatures of the previous year (EUR 6.8 billion). Overall volumes in 2015 were mainly driven by a strong performance in the Eastern
Neighbours, Russia and Asia and Latin America regions.
- In the Mediterranean countries, the amount signed reached EUR 1.4 billion. The majority of that amount was for projects focused on
providing support to build social and economic infrastructure, especially energy projects (53%) and transportation (25%). A total of 12% was
allocated under credit lines to banks for on-lending to SMEs.
- In the Eastern Neighbourhood, signatures totalled EUR 1.5 billion, representing the highest increase from 2014 (+26%) among all Mandate
regions, even in the context of Union sanctions on Russia.
- In Asia, Central Asia and Latin America, total signatures decreased by 18% from 2014, totalling EUR 1.1 billion. Latin America accounted for
55% of the amount signed, with special focus on infrastructure and private sector financing in Brazil and Nicaragua.
- In South Africa, three loans, totalling EUR 150 million, were signed to finance private sector credit lines to banks for on-lending to SMEs.
- The EIB continued to demonstrate its commitment to supporting the Union's climate action agenda. EIB operations signed in the regions
covered by the Decision remain well above the threshold of 25% set out in the Decision.
- The Decision emphasises a strong alignment of EIB external activity and the Union's external policies, programmes and instruments and it is
worth noting that over the year 2015. The EIB continued to cooperate closely with the Commission and the EEAS to strengthen the
consistency and coherence of EIB actions with external Union policies. The Regional Technical Operational Guidelines ("RTOGs") were
updated.
- The EIB continued working with other Multilateral Development Banks on the post 2015 Development Agenda and particularly on developing
a common approach to roles with respect to Financing for Development.

2013/0152(COD) - 14/09/2016 Follow-up document
The Commission presents a report on the mid-term review of the application of the Decision N° 466/2014/EU as regards the EU guarantee to
the European Investment Bank (EIB) against losses under financing operations supporting investment projects outside the Union
This report draws on an independent external evaluation carried out by an external consultant and a contribution from the EIB. It describes the
Commission's assessment of the results of the external evaluation and summarises the findings forming the basis for a proposed amendment
of the Decision.
The main conclusions of the report are as follows:
Situation of the external lending mandate: the external lending mandate has supported the Union's external policy agenda, showing sufficient
flexibility and reactivity to the geopolitical challenges as demonstrated through the cases of Ukraine (the Ukrainian crisis), Egypt and Morocco
(Arab spring) and Jordan (the refugee crisis). The mandate has played a role in the economic and therefore political stabilisation of those
countries hit by a political crisis.

By the end of 2015, a year and a half of financing activities under the mandate 2014-2020, cumulative signatures under the mandate reached
EUR 6.9 billion, corresponding to an utilisation rate of 26%. The utilisation rate in the Eastern Neighbourhood already exceeds 50%, followed
by Asia and Latin America and South Africa with 41% and 36% respectively.
The ceiling for the EIB external lending mandate is EUR 27 billion. In March 2014, the Union pledged a financial package in support of Ukraine
and asked the EIB to contribute with investments in the order of EUR 3 billion for the period 2014-2016.
One can see that in contributing to such a proportion of lending in Ukraine, the EIB is exhausting the Eastern Neighbourhood region ceiling
more rapidly than expected when the ceilings were originally prepared. The ceiling in the Eastern Neighbourhood will be reached as of
mid-2017 and the EIB would not be able to continue lending in the region for the entire period of the mandate.
Current policy context: the report notes that clear policy drivers for the Union's external actions have emerged and evolved recently, to be
considered for the mid-term review of the EIB's external lending mandate, notably:
the urgent work on the external dimension of EU migration crisis, and the potential role of the EIB;
wider work on sustainable development goals and financing for development (the Addis Ababa Action Agenda reaffirming the need to
go beyond ODA to support investments);
the climate change agenda, in particular after Paris COP 21;
the work on economic diplomacy supporting the internationalisation of EU businesses.
As requested by the European Council request on 18 March 2016, the EIB proposed an initiative mobilising additional financing in support of
sustainable growth, vital infrastructure and social cohesion in Southern neighbourhood and Western Balkans countries which are hit by the
migration crisis.
The EIBs proposal (the "Resilience initiative") is based on three building blocks:
Building block 1: Stepping up of activities that are possible under existing frameworks.
Building block 2: Enhancing the range of products offered in the regions to support mainly the public sector.
Building block 3: Enhancing the range of products offered in the regions to support mainly the private sector.
Legislative proposal: with regard to the ceiling on the mandate, based on the Commission's assessment of the findings of the mid-term review
and bearing in mind the EIB's Resilience initiative, the Commission presents, in parallel to the report, a proposal to revise Decision No
466/2014/EC, which aims to:
release the optional EUR 3 billion with the regional ceiling distribution as before;
create an additional maximum ceiling for EIB's private sector mandate amounting to EUR 2.3 billion (Building Block 3 under the EIB's
Resilience initiative), while introducing a comprehensive guarantee for the private sector operations directly linked to the refugees and
host communities, thus extending the coverage of the EU guarantee to commercial risks;
allow an increased flexibility for the EIB to switch amounts under the regional ceiling allocations (from current 10% between regions to
a level of 20%), but only in the direction of high priority regions for the Union, in particular Ukraine and migration response related
regions or any forthcoming challenges within the remaining part of the mandate 2014- 2020. The increased flexibility does not apply to
the new EIB private sector mandate of the EIB's Resilience initiative, nor to the amount of EUR 1.4 billion for private sector projects to
deal with the migration crisis;
strengthen the climate change dimension of the mandate. The volume of EIB operations for climate change mitigation and adaptation
should contribute to stepping up the proportion of EIB lending in support of climate related investment in developing countries from
25% to 35% by 2020.
These amendments involve an increase of EUR 5.3 billion for the provisioning of the Guarantee Fund regarding the external lending mandate ,
including the optional additional amount of EUR 3 billion:
within the optional amount, the Commission proposes to maintain the proportions for the Asia Latin America and South Africa regions ;
within that amount, the Commission proposes to split the increase of the EUR 1. 4 billion under the Resilience initiative between the
Pre-accession (EUR 500 million, only Western Balkan countries) and Mediterranean countries (EUR 900 million) ;
the remaining part of the optional amount will be allocated to the East Neighbourhood (EUR 1 177 million), thus more than doubling
their proportion and allowing for at least part continuation of increased business levels in the region, in particular in the Ukraine;
lastly, the amount of EUR 2,3 billion for EIB operations in the private sector for refugees is split between Pre-Accession (EUR 440
million, also only Western Balkan countries) and Mediterranean regions (EUR 1 860 million).
