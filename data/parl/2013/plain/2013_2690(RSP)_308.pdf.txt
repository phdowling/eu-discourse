Summary

The European Parliament adopted a resolution on Djibouti.
The resolution was tabled by the ECR, Greens/EFA, EPP, ALDE, and S& D groups.
It expresses its strong concern about the situation in Djibouti since the parliamentary elections of 22 February 2013 and the tense political
climate in the country. It is particularly concerned about reports that more than a thousand members of the opposition are said to have been
imprisoned and that some 60 political prisoners are in detention, and that demonstrations held to protest about irregularities in the elections
have been suppressed. The Djibouti authorities are called upon to put an end to repression of political adversaries and to release everybody
who is being detained on political grounds. Parliament strongly condemns the acts of sexual violence against women, and states that a judicial
investigation must be opened immediately with the aim of shedding light on the actions of the police and army during demonstrations and
punishing the perpetrators of human rights violations.
Members urge the EEAS, the Commission and their partners to work with the Djiboutians on long-term political reform, which should be
particularly facilitated by the strong relationship that already exists considering that Djibouti has been a key component of the fight against
terrorism and the region as well as hosting military bases. Parliament states its willingness to monitor the situation in Djibouti closely and wants
the Commission to do the same. It will propose restrictive measures in the event of a breach of the Cotonou Agreement (2000), and in
particular Articles 8 and 9 thereof.
Members call on the Government of Djibouti, with the aid of the African Union, to embark on a process of political dialogue with the opposition,
in accordance with the announcement made by the Head of State on 27 June 2013 on the occasion of the anniversary of Djibouti's
independence. The EU must support the work of regional organisations and contribute to the efforts to find a political solution to the current
crisis.
