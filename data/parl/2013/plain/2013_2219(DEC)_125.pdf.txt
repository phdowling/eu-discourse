2013/2219(DEC) - 26/07/2013 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: presentation by the Commission of the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2012, as part of
the 2012 discharge procedure.
Analysis of the accounts of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).
CONTENT: this Commission document sets out the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2012 as
prepared on the basis of the information presented by the institutions, organisations and bodies of the EU, in accordance with Article 129 (2) of
the Financial Regulation applicable to the EU's General Budget, including the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).
In 2012, the tasks and budget of this agency were as follows:
description of EASA's tasks: EASA, which is located in Cologne, was established by Regulation (EC) No 1592/2002 of the European
Parliament and of the Council and its role is to maintain a high uniform level of civil aviation safety in Europe and to ensure the proper
development of civil aviation safety. It shall issue opinions and recommendations to the Commission and take decisions in this area;
EASA's budget for the 2012 financial year: the Agencys budget for 2012, as presented in the Commission document on the
consolidated annual accounts of the European Union, gives the following figures:
§

Commitment appropriations :
- committed : EUR 164 million;
- paid : EUR 132 million;
- carried-over : EUR 27 million.

§

Payment appropriations :
- committed : EUR 176 million;
- paid : EUR 117 million;
- carried-over : EUR 53 million.

Please refer also to the final accounts of the EASA.

2013/2219(DEC) - 10/09/2013 Court of Auditors: opinion, report

PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the European Aviation Safety Agency for the year 2012,
together with the Agencys reply.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit concerned, amongst others, the annual accounts of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).
In the Courts opinion, the Agencys Annual Accounts fairly present, in all material respects, its financial position as of 31 December 2012 and
the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions of its financial rules and the
accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
The Court also considers that the transactions underlying the annual accounts of the Agency for the financial year ended 31 December 2012
are, in all material respects, legal and regular.
The report confirms that the Agencys 2012 budget amounted to EUR 150.2 million.
The report also makes a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of the Agency, accompanied by the latters
response. The main observations may be summarised as follows:
The Courts observations:
audits and internal controls: a methodology for ex post verifications was established. Room for improvement still exists in the following
areas: there is still no annual planning of verifications, the sample of transactions to be checked is not risk-based and the methodology
does not cover public procurement procedures;
budget implementation: carry-overs of committed appropriations were high for title III at 46%.
The Agencys replies:
audits: the Agency states that it has an annual plan in place which is risk-based and approved by the Executive Director. The annual
plan for 2013 includes public procurement procedures;
budget implementation: the Agency states that great efforts have been made to encourage responsible authorising officers to commit
earlier. This is already demonstrated by the improvement in title III carry over levels compared to the previous year which have
reduced significantly from 59 % in 2011 to 46 % in 2012.
As regards the activities of the Agency in 2012, the report refers to the adoption of:
opinions, including one alignment of Commission Regulation No (EC) 2042/2003 with Regulation (EC) No 216/2008;
decisions related to certification specifications and guidance material.
It supported the implementation of Bilateral Aviation Safety Agreements between the USA and the EU. It also adopted a number of decisions
and carried out standardisation inspections in the Member States.

2013/2219(DEC) - 21/03/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Petri SARVAMAA (EPP, FI) in which it recommended the European Parliament to
grant discharge to the Executive Director of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) in respect of the implementation of the Agency's
budget for the financial year 2012.
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the Agency for the financial
year 2012 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Members approved the closure of the Agencys accounts.
They made, however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is granted, in addition to the
general recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies.
Budget and financial management: Members noted that the overall level of appropriations committed was 95%. They with concern that
carry-overs of committed appropriations were high (46%) although this is partly justified by the multiannual nature of the Agencys
operations. Nevertheless, they considered that such a high level is at odds with the budgetary principle of annuality.
Prevention and management of conflicts of interests and transparency: Members welcomed the Agency's adoption of the "cooling off
period" of non-assignment for a year, so that anyone new to the organisation is not allocated work on files they had directly worked on
in the previous five years. They noted that following the recommendation of the discharge authority, the Agency will include
information and statistics on the management of conflicts of interests in its 2013 annual activity report.
Members also made a series of observations on transfers, procurement and recruitment procedures as well as comments on internal controls.

2013/2219(DEC) - 03/04/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading

Members also made a series of observations on transfers, procurement and recruitment procedures as well as comments on internal controls.
