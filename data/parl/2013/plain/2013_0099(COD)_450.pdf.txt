OJ L 321 30.11.2013, p. 0001 Summary

2013/0099(COD) - 08/04/2013 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: the amendment of Council Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 in relation to tariff quotas for wine exports from Kosovo.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: since 2000, the Union grants unlimited duty free access to the Union market for almost all products originating in the Western
Balkans. Currently, this system is provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 introducing exceptional trade measures for countries
participating in or linked to the European Unions Stabilisation and Association process.
All the Western Balkans countries benefit from preferential trade arrangements, including individual tariff quotas, under the Stabilisation and
Association Agreements or Interim Agreements on trade and trade-related matters concluded with these countries, with the exception of

Kosovo. Kosovo has no Stabilisation and Association Agreement, and can only benefit of the general tariff quota. When this tariff quota is
exhausted by other countries, Kosovan exporters have no preferential access to the EU market. Kosovo has demonstrated the potential to
export wine to the EU, and exporters need a stable and reliable framework.
IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken.
LEGAL BASIS: Article 207(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
CONTENT: it is proposed to allocate a specific tariff quota of 20.000 hl to Kosovo , which is deducted from the global quota of 50.000 hl
provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009, hence reduced to 30.000 hl. This is achieved by closing the current tariff quota and
establishing two new ones for the said amounts.
A mechanism is foreseen which eliminates the legal uncertainties deriving from the fact that the quotas are allocated on a first comefirst served
basis, and that the date of entry into force of this regulation cannot be anticipated. In order to avoid expanding the overall volume of
concessions, the quota reserved for Kosovo is applied on a pro-rata basis.
This reallocation does not affect the global volume of concession to the countries in the Western Balkans, and maintains stable wine market
conditions in the EU. The specific concessions provided for in the Stabilisation and Association Agreements or the Interim Agreements are
also not affected by this proposed Regulation.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: there are no implications for the European Unions budget.

2013/0099(COD) - 23/09/2013 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on International Trade adopted the report by Iuliu Winkler (EPP, RO) on the proposal for a regulation of the European
Parliament and of the Council on amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 in relation to tariff quotas for wine.
The committee recommended that the European Parliaments position adopted at first reading, following the ordinary legislative procedure,
should amend the Commission proposal as follows:
Delegated acts: Members called for the power to adopt delegated acts to be conferred on the Commission for a period of five years from the
date of entry into force of the proposed Regulation.
The delegation of power should be tacitly extended for periods of an identical duration, unless the European Parliament or the Council
opposes such extension not later than three months before the end of each period.
The delegation of power may be revoked at any time by the European Parliament or by the Council.

2013/0099(COD) - 22/10/2013 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 314 to 23, with 12 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation of the European
Parliament and of the Council on amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 in relation to tariff quotas for wine.
Parliament adopted its position at first reading following the ordinary procedure. The amendments adopted in plenary are the result of a
compromise negotiated between the European Parliament and the Council.
Delegated acts: the power to adopt delegated acts should be conferred on the Commission for a period of five years from the date of entry into
force of the proposed Regulation. The delegation of power should be tacitly extended for periods of an identical duration, unless the European
Parliament or the Council opposes such extension not later than three months before the end of each period.
The delegation of power may be revoked at any time by the European Parliament or by the Council. A decision to revoke shall put an end to
the delegation of the power. It shall not affect the validity of any delegated acts already in force.

2013/0099(COD) - 20/11/2013 Final act
PURPOSE: to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 in relation to tariff quotas for wine exports from Kosovo to the Union.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Regulation (EU) No 1202/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No
1215/2009 in relation to tariff quotas for wine.
CONTEXT: since 2000, the Union has granted unlimited duty-free access to the Union market for almost all products originating in the
Western Balkan countries. Currently, this system is provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 introducing exceptional trade
measures in favour of countries participating in the Stabilisation and Association Agreements put in place by the European Union.
This scheme is not, however, applicable to Kosovo.
Stable access to the market of the Union is necessary for the socioeconomic development of Kosovo, which has demonstrated the capacity in
particular to export wine.
In the absence of an individual tariff quota, Kosovan wine producers lack the necessary predictability for their exports. It is appropriate
therefore to allocate an individual annual tariff quota to Kosovo.
CONTENT: the Regulation plans to allocate to Kosovo an individual annual tariff quota of 20 000 hl for wine exports to the Union from which
would be deducted the global annual tariff quota of 50 000 hl proposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009. This last would be reduced
to 30 000 hl. To this end, the existing global tariff quota would be closed and two new ones created for the indicated amount.

It is also planned to introduce a mechanism which avoids legal uncertainties as regards the tariff quotas available on the date of entry into
force of this Regulation, and to prevent the overall volume of the concession from exceeding 50 000 hl.
As the total volume of the concessions is not modified, this Regulation does not affect the wine sector of the Union. The specific concessions
provided for in the Stabilisation and Association Agreements or the Interim Agreements are also not affected by this Regulation.
Impact of the device on EU-World Trade Organisation (WTO) obligations: the Regulation does not affect the obligations of the Union in the
WTO and does not need to receive a WTO waiver.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 03.12.2013.
DELEGATED ACTS: the Commission may adopt delegated acts in line with the Regulation. The power to adopt delegated acts shall be
conferred on the Commission for a period of five years from 3 December 2013. The Commission shall draw up a report in respect of the
delegation of power not later than nine months before the end of the five-year period. The delegation of power shall be tacitly extended for
periods of an identical duration, unless the European Parliament or the Council opposes such extension not later than three months before the
end of each period. The delegation of power may be revoked at any time by the European Parliament or by the Council. A decision to revoke
shall put an end to the delegation of the power.
