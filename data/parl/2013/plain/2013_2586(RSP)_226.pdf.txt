Summary

2013/2586(RSP) - 10/10/2013 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a resolution tabled by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on strengthening
cross-border law-enforcement cooperation in the EU: the implementation of the Prüm Decision and the European Information Exchange Model
(EIXM). It referred to the Commission Communication of 7 December 2012 on strengthening law enforcement cooperation in the EU: the
European Information Exchange Model (EIXM) and the Commission report of 7 December 2012 on the implementation of Council Decision
2008/615/JHA on the Prüm Decision and called on the Commission to perform a mapping exercise of EU and national legislation, including
(bilateral) international agreements, regulating the cross-border exchange of law enforcement information. Parliament agreed with the
Commission that more meaningful statistics are necessary to measure the real value of instruments and called for an independent, external
evaluation of the existing instruments for EU law enforcement information exchange in order to assess their measurable impact.
Whilst supporting the Commission's recommendations to streamline the use of existing instruments and channels and to improve training and
awareness on cross-border information exchange, Parliament was disappointed that the Commission did not provide for a more ambitious,
future-oriented vision, as was called for in the Stockholm Programme and the Internal Security Strategy, that could be a starting point for a
political debate on how to shape and to optimise law enforcement data sharing in the EU, while guaranteeing a robust level of data protection
and privacy. Members strongly encouraged the Commission to come forward with this vision. It also reiterated its position that the proposed
Data Protection Directive should be adopted as soon as possible.
Members regretted the considerable delays in the implementation of the Prüm Decision in several Member States, agreeing with the
Commission that further development of the instrument should not be considered before full implementation has been achieved.
