Summary

2013/2673(RSP) - 12/06/2013 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 539 votes to 103, with 16 abstentions a resolution on preparations for the European Council meeting
(27-28 June 2013) European action to combat youth unemployment. The resolution was tabled by the Greens/EFA, EPP and S& D groups.
It urges the European Council and Commission to step up their efforts to combat youth unemployment and stresses that the European
Parliament will closely monitor progress on whether the promised measures are implemented, especially as regards the Youth Guarantee, and
it invites youth organisations to keep the European Parliament updated on their analysis of Member State actions.
Members note that in April 2013, 23.5% of young people in the EU are unemployed, with the rates ranging from 7.5% in Germany to 62.5% in
Greece and 56.4% in Spain, indicating marked geographical differences.
Parliament insists that the solution to the urgent problem of youth unemployment lies in sustainable economic growth and an improvement of
the overall economic environment, such as strengthening the single market in services and the digital economy, furthering trade, and
promoting the interests of SMEs whilst upholding fundamental social rights. It calls on the Commission to develop common social investment
indicators regarding youth unemployment, and also to draw up recommendations on the feasibility of defining a common level of
unemployment allowance in the EU in relation with the previous wages of the unemployed person.
Youth Guarantee: welcoming the Council Recommendation of 28 February 2013 on Establishing a Youth Guarantee, Parliament calls for the
swift implementation of Youth Guarantee schemes in all Member States, which should effectively improve the situation of young people who
are not in employment, education or training (NEETs). It calls for the development of clear objectives and indicators for the Youth Guarantee
Scheme, and stresses that it intends to monitor closely all Member State activities to make the Youth Guarantee a reality.
EU funding: Members welcome the EUR 6 billion allocated for the new Youth Employment Initiative and calls for a frontloading in the first few
years of the Multiannual Financial Framework to implement youth guarantees. The costs of the latter being estimated at EUR 21 billion across
the eurozone, Parliament wants allocation to be revised upwards as part of a revision of the Multiannual Financial Framework. The European
Investment Bank is encouraged to contribute to the implementation of the Youth Guarantee.
Furthermore, Members emphasise funding is available before 2014 by reprogramming available structural funds and making full use of the
EUR 60 billion from the European Investment Bank as provided for in the Compact for Growth and Jobs. The Commission should also ask for
support from the private sector.
Combating youth unemployment at national level: Members want an ambitious, holistic policy approach which looks at education, training,
employment and self-employment initiatives, for all young people in an integrated way. They note that the dual system of vocational training
and the combined academic-vocational degree courses employed in some Member States have proved their worth during the crisis, keeping
levels of youth unemployment lower by making young people more employable.
Member States are asked to:
·

take preventive action against early dropout from school or from training or apprenticeship schemes (e.g. by introducing a dual
vocational training system);
consider ending those crisis measures which have a negative impact on youth employment;
improve cooperation between businesses and the educational sector with a view to improving the way in which curricula are linked to
the demands of the labour market, for example by extending Sector Skills Alliances and Knowledge Alliances.
