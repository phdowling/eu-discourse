Summary

The European Parliament adopted a resolution on the situation in Syria. The resolution was tabled by the ECR, Greens/EFA, EPP, ALDE, and
S&D groups. It strongly condemns the mass killing of civilians with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013, which, according to Western
intelligence, resulted in the deaths of at least 1 400 people, including 400 children, while noting that different sources seem to indicate that the
Syrian regime is responsible for this attack. Members stress that the proven use of chemical weapons, particularly against civilians, is a
flagrant breach of international law, a war crime and a crime against humanity, which requires a clear, strong, targeted and united response,
not excluding eventual deterrent measures. Members want the UN investigation into the use of chemical weapons in Syria completed quickly
and for the inspection team report to be sent as soon as possible to the Security Council. They welcome the proposal that Syria's chemical
weapons arsenal should be placed at the disposal of the international community with a view to having it destroyed as soon as possible,
accompanied by a binding resolution of the United Nations Security Council, that in the event of failure to comply, this measure might be
imposed on the basis of all the instruments provided for in the United Nations Charter . Stressing that the situation in Syria warrants a coherent
common approach by Member States, Parliament calls on the EU and its Member States to discuss further the situation in Syria in the
framework of the Foreign Affairs Council and to assess what measures the EU could adopt to support the democratic forces in the Syrian
opposition, facilitate a common approach with other members of the international community and provide further humanitarian assistance to
the population in Syria and in neighbouring countries. The EU should pay particular care to reaching out to all relevant actors and promoting a
region-wide de-escalation process. Parliament is convinced that a lasting solution to the current crisis in Syria can only be achieved through a
Syrian-led, inclusive political process with the backing of the international community.
Parliament would like to see the international community bring about a political solution for Syria which can promote a democratic transition,
and it calls, in particular, on Russia and China, as permanent members of the Security Council, to face their responsibilities and to facilitate the
achievement of a common position and a diplomatic solution to the Syrian crisis, without excluding a role for the UN General Assembly
whereby it could take up this matter in the event of a persistent blockage in the Security Council. Members express grave concern at the
ongoing humanitarian crisis in Syria and the implications for neighbouring countries, urging the EU and its Member States to increase their
assistance to Syrian refugees. Lastly, Parliament reiterates its calls for the Security Council to refer the situation in Syria to the International
Criminal Court for a formal investigation and for President Assad and his regime to step aside and pave the way for a democratic transition.
