2013/0242(COD) - 10/07/2013 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to enable the participation of the European Union in a European Metrology Programme for Innovation and Research jointly
undertaken by several Member States.
PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: metrology, the science of measurement, affects every aspect of our daily lives and ever more precise and reliable
measurements are essential to drive innovation and economic growth. All governments in technologically advanced countries support a
metrology infrastructure. Given the level of investment in metrology and its role in promoting scientific excellence and industrial
competitiveness, individual Member States or a few acting together could not compete globally.
The current European metrology research programme (EMRP) is a joint initiative implemented by 22 national metrology institutes. In
implementing the multiannual Framework Programme, it affords the possibility to coordinate national research programmes. By Decision No
912/2009/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, the Community decided to make a financial contribution to the EMRP matching
that of the participating states but not exceeding EUR 200 million, for the duration of the Seventh Framework Programme (2007-2013).
An interim evaluation recognised the value of the joint initiative. The main achievement of EMRP is strong integration by jointly programming
50 % of dedicated national funding for metrology research in Europe. Although substantial progress has been achieved under the EMRP, it
has become evident that the system needs to tackle several challenges in order to increase the impact of metrology research.
EMPIR, the successor programme, will contribute to a number of flagship initiatives under EUROPE 2020 that are affected by metrology
research (including Innovation Union), will be a more ambitious and inclusive programme implemented for ten years (2014-2024) by 28
participating states. As part of the improvements from the previous programme, EMPIR will include activities on innovation and industrial
exploitation, on research for norms and standards and on capacity building.
IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment took into consideration the following options:
Option 1 (No dedicated EU action): EU participation in the EMRP would be discontinued after the end of its current funding phase in 2013;
Option 2 (Business as usual - EMRP2): this option would continue with an identical initiative focused entirely on coordination and integration of
fundamental and challenge driven research. This would include some calls on topics relevant to the industry;
Option 3 (Improved Article 185 initiative EMPIR: this option would build on the success of the EMRP by implementing a more ambitious and
inclusive Article 185 initiative that is aligned with the Europe 2020 objectives.
The impact assessment report concluded that Option 3 is clearly the preferred option.
LEGAL BASIS: Article 185 and the second paragraph of Article 188 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.
CONTENT: the proposal for a Decision concerns the European Unions participation in the European Metrology Programme for Innovation and
Research (EMPIR) undertaken by Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France,
Croatia, Italy, Hungary, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Finland, Sweden, the United Kingdom, as
well as Bosnia-Herzegovina, Norway, Serbia, Switzerland and Turkey.
The overarching goal of the EMPIR initiative is to address the challenges faced by the European Metrology Research System and to maximise
the benefits of improved measurement solutions for Europe. The overall objectives of EMPIR are to:
provide integrated and fit-for-purpose metrology solutions supporting innovation and industrial competitiveness and measurement
technologies to tackle societal challenges such as health, environment and energy including support to policy development and
implementation;
create an integrated European Metrology Research system with critical mass and active engagement at regional, national, European
and international level.
The proposal provides for derogations from the Horizon 2020 Rules of Participation. It also provides for safeguards to ensure that the
principles of equal treatment and transparency are respected by the dedicated implementation structure when providing financial support to
third parties, and the EUs financial interests are protected.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: The maximum Unions financial contribution, including EFTA appropriations, to EMPIR shall be EUR 300 million
in current prices for the duration of the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme. The contributions will be related to the specific challenges and
themes covered by the initiative.

2013/0242(COD) - 29/01/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Industry, Research and Energy adopted the report by Niki TZAVELA (EFD, EL) on the proposal for a decision of the
European Parliament and of the Council on the participation of the Union in a European Metrology Programme for Innovation and Research
jointly undertaken by several Member States.
The parliamentary committee recommended that the position adopted by the European Parliament at first reading under the ordinary
legislative procedure should amend the Commissions proposal as follows:
Union's financial contribution: the maximum Union's financial contribution, including EFTA appropriations, to EMPIR shall be EUR 285 million
(as opposed to EUR 300 million in the Commissions proposal). This contribution shall be paid from appropriations allocated to the relevant
parts of the Specific Programme, implementing Horizon 2020, and in particular appropriations allocated to the following challenges and
themes:

·

leadership in nanotechnologies, advanced materials, biotechnology and advanced manufacturing and processing;

·

improving lifelong health and wellbeing;

·

improving food security, developing sustainable agriculture, marine and maritime research and the bio-economy;

·

making the transition to a reliable, sustainable and competitive energy system;

·

achieving a European transport system that is resource-efficient, environmentally friendly, safe and seamless; and moving towards a
resource-efficient and climate-change resilient economy and a sustainable supply of raw materials.

The programme shall support metrology capacity-building activities on different technological levels aiming to achieve a balanced and
integrated metrology system in the participating states and enabling them to develop their scientific and technical capabilities in metrology.
Conditions applicable to the Unions financial contribution: Members stressed the need to ensure there be a strong coherence between the
activities of the private-public partnerships and the research priorities defined in the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, such as open
access, equality between men and women and non-discrimination.
Rules of participation: with a view to guaranteeing simple and accessible information for applicants, Members called for proposals organised
by EMPIR to be published on the web-based Horizon 2020 Participant Portal.
Evaluation: the Commission shall organise an independent interim evaluation of EMPIR by 30 June 2017.
The Commission shall prepare a report on that evaluation which includes conclusions of the independent evaluation and observations by the
Commission. The result of the independent interim evaluation of EMPIR shall be taken into account in the interim evaluation of Horizon 2020.
In order to respond to unforeseen situations or to new developments and needs the Commission may, following the interim evaluation of
Horizon 2020, within the annual budgetary procedure, review the budget of EMPIR.

2013/0242(COD) - 15/04/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 647 votes to 20 with 6 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a decision of the
European Parliament and of the Council on the participation of the Union in a European Metrology Programme for Innovation and Research
jointly undertaken by several Member States.
Parliament adopted its position at first reading under the ordinary legislative procedure. The amendments adopted in plenary were the result of
a compromise between Parliament and Council. They amend the Commissions proposal as follows:
Union's financial contribution: the maximum Union's financial contribution, including EFTA appropriations, to EMPIR shall be EUR 300 million
(as in the Commissions proposal). This contribution shall be paid from appropriations allocated to the relevant parts of the Specific
Programme, implementing Horizon 2020, and in particular from Part II Industrial leadership and Part III Societal challenges.
In order to take into account the duration of Horizon 2020, calls for proposals under EMPIR should be launched at the latest by 31 December
2020.
In accordance with the Commission proposal, EMPIR will pursue the following general objectives:
·

provide appropriate, integrated and fit-for-purpose metrology solutions supporting innovation and industrial competitiveness, as well
as measurement technologies addressing societal challenges such as health, environment and energy, including support to policy
development and implementation;

·

create an integrated European Metrology Research system with critical mass and active engagement at regional, national, European
and international level.

Agreements between the Union and EURAMET: these should set out provisions for the publication of calls for proposals by EMPIR, in
particular on the single portal for participants as well as through other Horizon 2020 electronic means of dissemination managed by the
Commission.
Audits: administrative burdens should be reduced for all parties. Double audits and disproportionate documentation and reporting should be
avoided.
Evaluation: the Commission must organise an independent interim evaluation of EMPIR by 30 June 2017 and send that report to the European
Parliament and to the Council by 31 December 2017. The result of the interim evaluation will be taken into account in the interim evaluation of
Horizon 2020.
