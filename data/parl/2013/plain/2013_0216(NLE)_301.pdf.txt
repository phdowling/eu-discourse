OJ L 125 26.04.2014, p. 0048 Summary

2013/0216(NLE) - 27/06/2013 Initial legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude a Protocol between the European Union and Gabon setting out fishing opportunities and the financial contribution
provided for in the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the two Parties currently in force.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: on the basis of the powers conferred on it by the Council, the European Commission has conducted negotiations with Gabon
with a view to renewing the Protocol to the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and this country.
At the end of those negotiations, a new draft Protocol was initialled by the negotiators on 24 April 2013.

IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the interested parties were consulted during the evaluation of the Protocol for the period 2005-11. Experts from the
Member States were also consulted in technical meetings. These consultations concluded that it would be beneficial to maintain a fishing
protocol with Gabon.
LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2) in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) and (7) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
CONTENT: this proposal seeks to conclude the Protocol between the EU and Gabon setting out the fishing opportunities and the financial
contribution provided for in the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Gabonese Republic.
Aim: the main aim of the Protocol to the Agreement is to provide fishing opportunities for EU vessels in Gabonese waters within the limits of
the available surplus, in accordance with the best available scientific advice and recommendations of the International Commission for the
Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT).
The general aim is to enhance the cooperation between the European Union and Gabon, thereby creating a partnership framework within
which to develop a sustainable fisheries policy and sound exploitation of fishery resources in the Gabonese fishing zone, in the interests of
both Parties.
Fishing protocol: the Protocol provides for annual fishing opportunities in the following categories:
27 freezer tuna seiners;
8 pole-and-line tuna vessels.
Financial contribution: the annual financial contribution of EUR 1 350 000 is based on:
a reference tonnage of 20 000 tonnes, for an amount of EUR 900 000 linked to access;
support for the development of the sectoral fisheries policy of Gabon amounting to EUR 450 000. This support meets the objectives of
the national fisheries policy and in particular the needs of the Gabonese Republic in the fight against illegal fishing and the
implementation of the national fisheries strategy.
The Parties may adopt, in the Joint Committee, measures entailing a review of fishing opportunities. In that case, the financial contribution
shall be adjusted proportionately and pro rata temporis.
At the request of Gabon, the Gabonese Government may call on the European Union in order to consider the possibility of experimental
fishing in order to exploit certain fisheries, under the direct supervision of scientists representing the two Parties and either ICCAT or the
relevant regional fisheries organisation. They shall consult each other and determine on a case-by-case basis the relevant species, conditions
and other parameters. The authorisations for experimental fishing shall be granted for a maximum of 12 months. In the event that the Parties
consider that experimental campaigns have given positive results, the Government may allocate fishing opportunities for new species to the
European Union fleet until this Protocol expires. The financial compensation of the current Protocol shall consequently be increased.
Duration of the fishing protocol: this Protocol and the Annexes shall apply for a duration of three years from the date of provisional application
of the new Protocol.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the total amount of operational commitments for the Protocol is set at EUR 4.05 million for 2013 to 2015. Other
expenditure such as administrative, management and human resources amount to EUR 318 000.

2013/0216(NLE) - 26/11/2013 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude, on behalf of the European Union, the Protocol setting out fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided
for in the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the Gabonese Republic.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: the Union has negotiated a new protocol with the Gabonese Republic granting Union vessels fishing opportunities in waters
in which the Gabonese Republic exercises its sovereignty or its jurisdiction as regards fishing.
The New Protocol was signed in accordance with Decision 2013/462/EU, and is applied provisionally as from 24 July 2013.
The New Protocol should therefore be approved.
CONTENT: the proposed Decision seeks to conclude the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities with Gabon on behalf of the Union.
The general aim is to enhance the cooperation between the European Union and Gabon, thereby creating a partnership framework within

both Parties.
For details of the fishing opportunities and the financial implications of the draft Protocol on the budget of the European Union, please refer to
the summary of the Commissions initial legislative proposal dated 27/06/2013.
Simplified procedure to define the EUs position within the EU-Gabon joint committee: the Partnership Agreement set up a Joint Committee
which is responsible for monitoring the application of the Agreement. Furthermore, in accordance with the Protocol, the Joint Committee may
approve certain modifications to the Protocol. In order to facilitate the approval of such modifications, it is appropriate to empower the
Commission, subject to specific conditions, to approve them under a simplified procedure laid down in the proposed Decision.
Annex: the draft Decision details the extent of the powers conferred on the Commission as well as the procedure to establish a Union position
within the joint committee. The Commission should be authorised to negotiate with Gabon, modifications to the Protocol as regards:
the revision of fishing opportunities;
the decision on the modalities of the sectoral support of the Protocol;
technical specifications and modalities falling within the powers of the Joint Committee.

In the Joint Committee, the Union shall act in accordance with the objectives pursued by the Union within the framework of the Common
Fisheries Policy.
Technical provisions are provided to establish the framework and the practical conditions of the approval of the modifications to the Protocol.
