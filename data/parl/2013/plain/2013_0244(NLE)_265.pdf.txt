2013/0244(NLE) - 10/07/2013 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to prolong the Clean Sky Joint Undertaking in the field of aeronautics (Clean Sky 2).
PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation.

Summary

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to
follow its opinion.
BACKGROUND: the framework programme for research and innovation Horizon 2020 encourages public-private partnerships (PPP) in
research and innovation with a view to tackling the major challenges facing Europe.
This proposal provides for a prolongation of the Clean Sky Joint Technology Initiative (JTI) in the field of aeronautics launched under the
Seventh Framework Programme (2007-2013). The Clean Sky Joint Undertaking was established in 2007 in response to the need to curtail the
environmental impact of growing air traffic and cut aircraft emissions. Its research programme focuses on these objectives with a delivery
timeline of 2017.
Since its establishment, the Clean Sky has successfully stimulated developments towards the strategic environmental targets , as confirmed by
the Interim Evaluation of the programme. Clean Sky has been successful in attracting extensive and wide-ranging participation by all key
stakeholders, including a large number of SMEs.
With reference to aeronautics, a High Level Group on Aviation Research produced in 2011 a new vision for the European aviation sector,
Flightpath 2050, following the objectives of Europe 2020 and the Transport White Paper. It sets ambitious goals to reduce the environmental
impact of air transport by 2050. Clean Sky contributes to this goal in Europe through advanced research and full-scale demonstration actions
in green technology for air transport in line with the strategic research agenda identified, with the involvement of all public and private
stakeholders.
The predicted traffic growth will lead to significant increases in emissions if no measures are taken and it is therefore urgent to drastically
reduce air transport environmental impacts. The fragmentation and occasional overlapping of national programmes calls for a more effective
action at EU level. In this context, the Clean Sky 2 Joint Undertaking should continue to support the Clean Sky research programme by
extending the scope of its activities in the context of a modified set of rules.
IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Impact Assessment concluded that the improved JU option, which takes on board the lessons learnt from the
current Clean Sky JU operation, represents the best approach to reach the stated objectives of the R&D programme.
LEGAL BASIS: Articles 187 and Article 188 (first paragraph) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
CONTENT: the proposal seeks to create a joint undertaking in the field of aeronautics. It replaces and succeeds the previous Clean Sky JU
launched in 2008 under the seventh framework programme and would capitalise on the results of the current programme and address novel
technology areas. The Clean Sky 2 JU would run for a period running from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2024 .
The proposed initiative has the following objectives:
1. to contribute to the finalisation of research activities initiated under the Clean Sky Joint Technology Initiative and, in particular, the Smart,
Green and Integrated Transport Challenge under the Societal Challenges pillar of the Council Decision establishing the Horizon 2020 Specific
Programme;
2. to contribute to the objectives of the Joint Technology Initiative on Clean Sky 2 , in particular to integrate, demonstrate and validate
technologies capable of:
(a) increasing aircraft fuel efficiency thus reducing CO2 emissions by 20 to 30 % compared to "state-of-the-art" aircraft entering into
service as from 2014;
(b) reducing aircraft NOx and noise emissions by 20 to 30 % compared to "state-of-the-art" aircraft entering into service as from
2014.
These objectives should be achieved by 2024.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the maximum amount of EU contribution (including EFTA contribution) shall be EUR 1.8 billion in current prices.
The maximum amount of Union contribution foreseen for operational costs shall be EUR 1760 million. The maximum amount of Union
contribution foreseen for running costs shall be EUR 40 million.

2013/0244(NLE) - 11/02/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Industry, Research and Energy adopted the report by Christian EHLER (EPP, DE) on the proposal for a Council regulation
on the Clean Sky 2 Joint Undertaking.
Joint undertaking in the field of aeronautics: it is specified that the Joint Undertaking Clean Sky 2 should continue to support the research
programme Clean Sky by implementing the remaining activities scheduled in the Clean Sky research programme under the rules of the Clean
Sky Joint Undertaking.
In order to take account of the duration of the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014-2020), all calls for
proposals shall be launched by 31 December 2020.
Scope of activities: Members wanted to clarify the scope of activities of the Clean Sky 2 Joint Undertaking, in particular with respect to the
relevant Technology Readiness Levels covered by its research programme. The Horizon 2020 Rules for Participation also called for a greater
consideration of the TRL-concept to stipulate funding levels, which is taken up in this article with a view to the funding rates used in indirect
actions.
Financial contribution: the maximum Union contribution, including contributions from countries of the European Free Trade Association
(EFTA), to the clean Sky 2 Joint Undertaking to cover administrative costs and operational costs should be EUR 1.71 billion (rather than EUR
1.8 billion in the Commission proposal).
The value of the additional activities should not be a substitute for the contributions to Clean Sky 2 and should not be matched by Union
contributions. Members other than the Union who committed to additional activities should communicate updates on the fulfilment of their
respective commitments and l report annually on their additional activities to the general public.

Evaluation: by 30 June 2017 the Commission shall organise an independent interim evaluation of the Joint Undertaking. The results of the
independent interim evaluation of the Joint Undertaking should be taken into account in the interim evaluation of Horizon 2020.
In order to respond to unforeseen situations or to new developments and needs the Commission may, following the interim evaluation of
Horizon 2020 review the budget of the Joint Undertaking within the annual budgetary procedure.
Duty to divulge information: the report contains a new provision stating that Members of the staff of the Joint Undertaking, the Executive
Director, and members of the Governing Board shall, without delay, report such fraud as might have come to their knowledge in the
performance of their duties or office in OLAF.
Participation: in accordance with the principles of transparency and non-discrimination, calls for proposals organised by the Clean Sky 2 Joint
Undertaking should be published on the web-based Horizon 2020 Participant Portal.

2013/0244(NLE) - 15/04/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 568 votes to 81, with 25 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a Council regulation on
the Clean Sky 2 Joint Undertaking.
Parliament approved the Commission proposal subject to the following amendments:
Joint Undertaking in the field of aeronautics: for the implementation of the Joint Technology Initiative in aeronautics, Clean Sky 2 Joint
