2013/0189(NLE) - 30/09/2013 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to amend Council Directive 2010/18/EU on implementing the revised Framework Agreement on parental leave because of the
change in status of Mayotte.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to
follow its opinion.
BACKGROUND: by Decision 2012/419/EU, the European Council decided to amend the status of Mayotte with regard to the European Union
with effect from 1 January 2014. Therefore, from that date, Mayotte will cease to be an overseas territory and will become an outermost region
of the Union within the meaning of Articles 349 and 355(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU.
Following this change in legal status of Mayotte, Union law will apply to Mayotte from 1 January 2014. Certain specific measures, justified by
the particular structural social and economic situation of Mayotte as a new outermost region, on the special conditions of application of Union
law should, however, be established.
Considering the specific structural economic and social situation of Mayotte, particularly the fact that the jobs market is underdeveloped and
the employment rate is low due to its remoteness, insularity, difficult topography and climate situation, an additional implementation period for
Council Directive 2010/18/EU of 8 March 2010 implementing the revised Framework Agreement on parental leave concluded by
BUSINESSEUROPE, UEAPME, CEEP and ETUC and repealing Directive 96/34/EC should be provided in order to ensure that equal
treatment in the particular field of parental leave is achieved progressively and so as not to destabilise the gradual economic development of
the new outermost region.

The provided additional transposition period should allow this specific disadvantaged structural social and economic situation of Mayotte, as a
new outermost region, to be improved.
LEGAL BASIS: Article 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken.
CONTENT: with the proposed Decision, it is planned to extend the additional transitional period for Mayotte as regards the transposition of the
revised Framework Agreement on parental leave concluded by BUSINESSEUROPE, UEAPME, CEEP and ETUC, so that this Directive may
be applied as of 31 December 2018 in this outermost region.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no impact on the EU budget.

2013/0189(NLE) - 28/11/2013 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs adopted the report by Pervenche BERÈS (S&D, FR) on the draft Council directive
amending Council Directive 2010/18/EU because of the change of status of Mayotte.
Takes note that the Council consulted the European Parliament on the draft directive, although such consultation is not required under the
legal basis proposed by the Commission, Members approved the draft Council directive with a number of amendments relating to the legal
basis of the proposal.
The Commission based its proposal on Article 155(2) of the TFEU whereby the Council takes a decision on implementation of management
and labour agreements on a proposal from the Commission, and the European Parliament is informed. The Council, on the contrary, proposed
changing the legal basis to Article 349 TFEU on specific measures for outermost regions, whereby the Council adopts these measures on a
proposal from the Commission after consulting Parliament.
Members considered the legal basis proposed by the Commission to be correct, and proposed a legal basis, these being Articles 155(2) and
Article 349. They also proposed that the directive should become a decision.

2013/0189(NLE) - 12/12/2013 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted a legislative resolution by 542 votes to 53 with 21 abstentions, in the framework of a special legislative
procedure (consultation of Parliament), a resolution on the draft Council directive amending Council Directive 2010/18/EU because of the
change of status of Mayotte.
Parliament approved the proposal subject to the following amendments:
Legal base: Parliament called for the legal base for this proposal to be Article 155(2) of the TFEU with Article 349 as opposed to just Article
349.
Legal form of the instrument: Parliament called for the legal instrument for the adoption of the proposal to be a Decision and not a Directive.

2013/0189(NLE) - 17/12/2013 Final act
PURPOSE: to amend Council Directive 2010/18/EU on implementing the revised Framework Agreement on parental leave because of the
change in status of Mayotte.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Directive 2013/62/EU amending Directive 2010/18/EU implementing the revised Framework Agreement on parental
leave concluded by BUSINESSEUROPE, UEAPME, CEEP and ETUC, following the amendment of the status of Mayotte with regard to the
European Union.
BACKGROUND: by European Council Decision 2012/419/EU, the European Council decided to amend the status of Mayotte with regard to
the Union with effect from 1 January 2014. From that date, Mayotte will cease to be an overseas country or territory and will become an
outermost region of the Union within the meaning of Article 349 and Article 355(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union
(TFEU).
Following this amendment of the legal status of Mayotte, Union law will apply to Mayotte from 1 January 2014. Taking account of the particular
structural social and economic situation of Mayotte, certain specific measures aimed at laying down the conditions of application of Union law
should be established.
Considering the specific structural social and economic situation of Mayotte, in particular the fact that the labour market is underdeveloped and
the employment rate is low due to its remoteness, insularity, difficult topography and climate, an additional implementation period for Council
Directive 2010/18/EU implementing the revised Framework Agreement on parental leave concluded by BUSINESSEUROPE, UEAPME, CEEP
and ETUC and repealing Directive 96/34/EC should be provided for in order to ensure that equal treatment in the particular field of parental
leave is achieved progressively and in a way that does not destabilise the gradual economic development of Mayotte.
That additional implementation period should allow the specific disadvantaged structural social and economic situation of Mayotte, as a new
outermost region, to be improved.
Directive 2010/18/EU should therefore be amended accordingly.
CONTENT: under this Directive, it is provided to grant an additional implementation period for Council Directive 2010/18/EU implementing the
revised Framework Agreement on parental leave concluded by BUSINESSEUROPE, UEAPME, CEEP and ETUC. This period shall be
extended to 31 December 2018 as regards Mayotte as an outermost region of the Union.

ENTRY INTO FORCE: 01.01.2014. This Directive is addressed to France.
