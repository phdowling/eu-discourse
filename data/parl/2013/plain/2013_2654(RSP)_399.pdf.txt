The European Parliament adopted a resolution on Guantánamo: hunger strike by prisoners.

EP

Summary

The resolution was tabled by the Greens/EFA, S&D, ALDE and GUE/NGL groups.
It recalls that a large part of the 166 remaining prisoners at Guantánamo Bay have engaged in hunger strikes to protest about current
conditions at the detention facility, and that at least 10 detainees participating in the hunger strike have been force-fed in order to stay alive.
Parliament expresses concern for the well-being of detainees and calls on the US to be respectful of their rights and decisions, and treat
detainees with respect.
Members express regret that the commitment of the US President to close Guantánamo by January 2010 has not yet been implemented. They
reiterate their call on the US authorities to review the military commissions system to ensure fair trials, to close Guantánamo, to prohibit in any
circumstances the use of torture, ill-treatment and indefinite detention without trial.
Members underline that prisoners still detained should be entitled to regular review of the lawfulness of their detention, reiterating that the fight
against terrorism cannot be waged at the expense of established basic shared values, such as respect for human rights and the rule of law.
They also insist that detainees in US custody should be charged promptly and tried in accordance with international standards of the rule of
law or else released.
