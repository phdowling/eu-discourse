Summary

2013/2189(IMM) - 24/01/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Legal Affairs adopted the report by Cecilia WIKSTRÖM (ADLE, SE) in which it recommended the European Parliament to
waive the immunity of Zbigniew Ziobro (EFD, PL).
To recall, the Public Prosecutor of the Republic of Poland requested the waiver of the parliamentary immunity of Zbigniew Ziobro, Member of
the European Parliament, in connection with legal action concerning an alleged criminal offence.

The request by the Public Prosecutor relates to an offence subject to private prosecution under the Polish Criminal Code, following a libel case
in the context of an interview with the former Polish Minister for Agriculture Mr. Artur Balazs.
At the sitting of 9 September 2013, the President announced that he had received a request from the office of the Public Prosecutor of the
Polish Republic concerning the waiver of the parliamentary immunity of Zbigniew Ziobro with reference to Articles 8 and 9 of the Protocol on
the Privileges and Immunities of the European Union.
Article 8 of the Protocol stipulates that Members of the European Parliament shall not be subject to any form of inquiry, detention or legal
proceedings in respect of opinions expressed or votes cast by them in the performance of their duties.
Article 9 stipulates that Members shall enjoy, in the territory of their own State, the immunities accorded to members of the Parliament of that
State.
Recalling that Parliament alone may decide whether immunity is or is not to be waived in a given case, Members stated that the alleged
offence does not have a direct or obvious connection with Zbigniew Ziobros performance of his duties as a Member of the European
Parliament, nor does it constitute an opinion expressed or a vote cast in the performance of his duties as a Member of the European
Parliament for the purposes of Article 8 of Protocol No 7 on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Union.
Given that in the present case Parliament has found no evidence of fumus persecutionis, (suspicion that the case has been brought with the
intention of causing political damage to the Member concerned) and that a decision not to waive a Members immunity would prevent the other
private party from pursuing his case before the court as part of his defence, Members called on the European Parliament to waive the
immunity of Zbigniew Ziobro.

2013/2189(IMM) - 04/02/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament decided to waive the immunity of Zbigniew Ziobro (EFD, PL).
Parliament recalled that Poland requested the waiver of the parliamentary immunity of Zbigniew Ziobro in connection with legal action
concerning an alleged criminal offence.
The request by the Public Prosecutor relates to an offence subject to private prosecution under the Polish Criminal Code, following a libel case
in the context of an interview with the former Polish Minister for Agriculture Mr. Artur Balazs.
Given that the alleged offence does not have a direct or obvious connection with Zbigniew Ziobros performance of his duties as a Member of
the European Parliament, nor does it constitute an opinion expressed or a vote cast in the performance of his duties as a Member of the
European Parliament for the purposes of Article 8 of Protocol No 7 on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Union and that the
criminal proceedings brought against Zbigniew Ziobro bear no connection to his position as a Member of the European Parliament , Members
of the Parliament decided to waive the immunity of Zbigniew Ziobro.
