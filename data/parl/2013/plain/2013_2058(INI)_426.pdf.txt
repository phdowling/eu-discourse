2013/2058(INI) - 06/03/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Development unanimously adopted the report by Charles GOERENS (ADLE, LU) on the EU 2013 Report on Policy
Coherence for Development.
Firstly, Members recalled that only a European vision based on solidarity which did not assume there to be any incompatibility between the
objectives of tackling poverty inside and outside theEU could overcome conflicts of interest among the various policies of the Union and
reconcile them with the imperatives of development. PCD was now recognised as an obligation and regarded as a tool of a comprehensive
policy to incorporate the multiple dimensions of development.
Attainment of PCD: Members proposed that an arbitration system be established, to be operated by the President of the Commission, to bring
about PCD, and that in the event of divergences among the various policies of the Union, the President of the Commission should fully
shoulder his political responsibility for the overall approach on the basis of the commitments accepted by the Union with regard to PCD. The
committee called on the European Union, Member States and their partner institutions to ensure that the new post-2015 framework included a
PCD objective which made it possible to develop reliable indicators to measure the progress of donors and partner countries.
Members called on the Commission to:
maintain its commitment to the field of development and human rights, recalling the role of the latter in imparting impetus to the Unions
policies and coordinating them;
actively promote a coherent and modern vision of human development in order to attain the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)
and honour the commitments given;
contract regular independent ex-post assessments of the development impact of key policies,
provide specific training on PCD and development impact to staff in non-development services.
Members confirmed the need to appoint a permanent rapporteur on the development agenda for the period after 2015, who should also
ensure that due account is taken of PCD. They stressed the important role which the European Parliament could play in the process of
promoting PCD by assigning it priority in Parliaments agendas, by increasing the number of meetings between committees and between
parliaments relating to PCD, by promoting dialogue on PCD with partner countries and by fostering exchanges of views with civil society.
Priority areas of action: PCD should apply to the following policy areas:
·

migration flow management;

·

trade policy;

·

social and environmental responsibility on the part of the private sector;

·

environmental and climate change policies;

·

tax policy;

The report called upon the Commission to also include in the annual report on the implementation of the Raw Materials Initiative information on
the impact of new agreements, programmes and initiatives on resource-rich developing countries.
Lastly, it stressed that fisheries agreements between the Union and third countries, particularly developing countries, must primarily be tools
geared to bolstering the Unions partnership with developing countries and must be designed to promote sustainable fishing which will help
those countries to develop their own economies.

2013/2058(INI) - 13/03/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 326 votes 19 with 23 abstentions, a resolution on the EU 2013 Report on Policy Coherence for
Development.
Parliament began by recalling that only a European vision based on solidarity which did not assume there to be any incompatibility between
the objectives of tackling poverty inside and outside the EU could overcome conflicts of interest among the various policies of the Union and
reconcile them with the imperatives of development. PCD was now recognised as an obligation and regarded as a tool of a comprehensive
policy to incorporate the multiple dimensions of development.
Parliament considered that the Union must take on a strong leadership role in promoting PCD, and noted that as much as EUR 800 million
could be saved annually from cutting transaction costs if the EU and its Member States concentrated their aid efforts on fewer countries and
activities.

Attainment of PCD: Parliament proposed that an arbitration system be established, to be operated by the President of the Commission, to
bring about PCD, and that in the event of divergences among the various policies of the Union, the President of the Commission should fully
shoulder his political responsibility for the overall approach on the basis of the commitments accepted by the Union with regard to PCD.
Parliament called on the European Union, Member States and their partner institutions to ensure that the new post-2015 framework included a
PCD objective which made it possible to develop reliable indicators to measure the progress of donors and partner countries.

policies and coordinating them;
actively promote a coherent and modern vision of human development in order to attain the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)
and honour the commitments given;
contract regular independent ex-post assessments of the development impact of key policies,
provide specific training on PCD and development impact to staff in non-development services.

ensure that due account is taken of PCD. They stressed the important role which the European Parliament could play in the process of

Priority areas of action: PCD should apply to the following policy areas:
·

migration flow management;

·

trade policy;

·

social and environmental responsibility on the part of the private sector;

·

environmental and climate change policies;

·

tax policy.

On trade policy, Parliament stressed that trade and development did not always accord perfectly. It considered that developing countries
should selectively open up their markets and that social and environmental conditions such as ILO standards should not be forgotten. It
recalled the need to include references to them in WTO agreements in order to avoid social and environmental dumping.
Parliament welcomed the fact that the relevance of smallholder farming in combating hunger was recognised by the EU and called for
systematic assessment of the impact of European agricultural, trade and energy policies, including EU biofuel policy , which are likely to have
adverse effects on developing countries.
The resolution called upon the Commission to also include in the annual report on the implementation of the Raw Materials Initiative
information on the impact of new agreements, programmes and initiatives on resource-rich developing countries.
Lastly, they recognised the high level of responsibility borne by the EU in ensuring that its fisheries are based on the same standards in terms
of ecological and social sustainability both inside and outside Union waters. Such coherence required coordination both within the Commission
itself and between the Commission and the governments of the individual Member States.
