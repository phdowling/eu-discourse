Summary

The European Parliament adopted a resolution on clashes in Sudan and subsequent media censorship. The resolution was tabled by the
ECR, Greens/EFA, S&D, EPP, GUE/NGL, ALDE groups and Jaroslav Paka.
It expressed its deep concern at the deteriorating political, economic and social situation in Sudan, marked by violence and loss of life during
the protests which have recently swept through the country, deploring particularly the Sudanese Governments use of live ammunition against
peaceful protesters and large-scale detentions. Members condemned the killings, the violence against demonstrators, the media censorship,
the political intimidation and the harassment and arbitrary arrest of human rights and political activists and journalists.
The Commission was asked urgently to legally restrict the export of mass surveillance technologies from the EU to countries where they were
likely to be used to violate digital freedoms and other human rights.
Parliament regretted the decision taken by the EU High Representative to terminate the mandate of the EU Special Representative for
Sudan/South Sudan, given the severe political unrest in Sudan and armed conflicts during which Sudanese forces and government-sponsored
militias continue to engage in war crimes with impunity. It stated that without a designated EU Special Representative, the EU would be left on
the sidelines of international negotiations and efforts, especially in view of the fact that the US, Russia and China all have special envoys for
Sudan. The High Representative was asked to reverse this decision and extend the mandate of the Special Representative for Sudan/South
Sudan.
Parliament called on the Government of Sudan to:
immediately release all peaceful demonstrators, political activists, members of the opposition, human rights defenders, medical
personnel, bloggers and journalists arrested while exercising their right to freedom of speech and assembly;
immediately to put a stop to the crackdown and to end the impunity enjoyed by National Intelligence Security Services (NISS)
members, and scrap the draconian 2010 National Security Act, which allows the detention of suspects for up to four-and-a-half months
without any form of judicial review;
cease all forms of repression against those who exercise their right to freedom of expression, both online and offline, and to allow its
population free access to the internet at all times, which is a fundamental right, recognised by the UNHRC;
continue implementing the necessary political reforms to provide solutions to the country's chronic economic mismanagement,
poverty, and rising levels of corruption;
engage in a genuine process of comprehensive national dialogue with the opposition, especially in Darfur.
