Summary

2013/2929(DEA) - 12/12/2013 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament declared, by 460 votes to 136 with 18 abstentions, that it has no objections to the Commission delegated regulation
of 30 October 2013 amending Annexes I, II and IV of Regulation (EU) No 978/2012 applying a scheme of generalised tariff preferences.
The Commission has stressed that it is essential for Parliament to adopt its decision before 16 December 2013, given the need for the
delegated regulation to be published before 1 January 2014, enabling the timely reinstatement of Myanmar/Burma and the inclusion of South
Sudan in the GSP scheme.
