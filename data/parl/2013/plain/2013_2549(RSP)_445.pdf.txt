Summary

2013/2549(RSP) - 23/05/2013 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a resolution on a macro-regional strategy for the Alps.
The resolution was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ALDE, and Greens/EFA groups.
Members recall that the territories that make up the Alpine region share many common features, such as the geographical uniqueness of their
high mountain areas and their close interactions with the larger cities in the peri-Alpine belt. They consider that the macro-regional strategy for
the Alps, which should be comparable to the strategies adopted by the EU for the Baltic Sea and Danube regions will afford an opportunity to
give the Alps a new dimension and greater significance in the EU context, in terms of better access to funding. The multi-level governance
principle should be put at the heart of the planning and implementation of the Alps strategy.
Members call for the Commission to submit without delay a specific action plan for this area with a view to overcoming the structural handicaps
faced by mountain regions and creating the right conditions for economic growth and effective social and territorial cohesion in the region.
They note the Alpine region belongs to several EU Member States and non-EU countries, and constitutes an interconnected macro-region with
heterogeneous economic capacities and growing concerns over environmental issues, demographic change, transport infrastructure, tourism
and energy-related issues. Coordination of the internal and external policies of all stakeholders could produce better results and added value.
A macro-regional strategy for the Alps must coordinate existing EU funds, in particular under the cohesion policy, in order to implement
projects aimed at addressing common challenges such as protection of the environment, investment in competitiveness and innovation,
agriculture and forestry, water, energy, environmental and climate issues and transport.
