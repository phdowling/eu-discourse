2013/0266(CNS) - 26/07/2013 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to extend the autonomous tariff quotas of the Union on imports of certain fishery products into the Canary Islands for a new period
of seven years, i.e. from 2014 to 2020.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to
take account of Parliaments opinion.
BACKGROUND: the Canary Islands are one of the outermost regions of the European Union, for which special measures may be foreseen,
pursuant to Article 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, in order to overcome the economic disadvantages these
regions suffer due to their geographical situation.
Since 1991, the European Union has suspended, partially or in full, the Common Custom Tariff duties on imports of certain fishery products
into the Canary Islands.
The exceptional geographical situation of the Canary Islands in relation to the sources of supply of fishery products which are essential for
domestic consumption entails costs that are a severe burden for this sector. This is why the Spanish government has made a request for the

prolongation of the measures under Council Regulation (EC) No 645/2008 opening and providing for the administration of autonomous
Community tariff quotas on imports of certain fishery products into the Canary Islands.
IMPACT ASSESSMENT: an impact assessment was not deemed necessary. The examination of the reports by the Spanish authorities
provided the necessary basis for the preparation of the Commission proposal.
LEGAL BASIS: Article 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
CONTENT: with the aim of giving a long term perspective to economic operators to reach a level of activities which stabilises the economic
and social environment on the islands, the Commission is proposing the extension, for an additional period, of the autonomous tariff quota of
the Common Customs Tariff duties for certain goods as detailed in the Annex of Regulation (EC) No 645/2008 .
Measures are envisaged to ensure that:
the suspension shall be granted exclusively for fishery products intended for the Canary Islands' domestic market;
the Commission is kept regularly informed of the volume of imports in question so that, if necessary, it can take steps to prevent any
speculative movement or deflection of trade.
This 7-year period synchronises the measures with other actions of the Union in favour of the Canary Islands, in particular those proposed in
the context of the Commission's proposal for a European Maritime and Fisheries Fund.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has implications for the Union budget since the duty suspensions will lead to loss in revenue of the
Union's own resources estimated at EUR 9.1 million per year.

2013/0266(CNS) - 29/11/2013 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Fisheries adopted, in the framework of a special legislative procedure (consultation of Parliament) the report by Gabriel
MATO ADROVER (EPP, ES) on the proposal for a Council regulation opening and providing for the administration of autonomous tariff quotas
of the Union on imports of certain fishery products into the Canary Islands from 2014 to 2020
The committee approved the commission proposal without amendment.
The Canary Islands are one of the outermost regions. The exceptional geographical situation of the Canary Islands in relation to the sources of
supply of certain fishery products which are essential for domestic consumption entails additional costs for this sector.
It was recalled that, since 1991, the European Union has suspended partially or in full the Common Custom Tariff duties on imports of certain
fishery products into the Canary Islands. Council Regulation (EC) No 645/2008 provided for the administration of two duty-free tariff quotas for
imports of certain fishery products into the Canary Islands for the period 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013. Unless these measures are
extended, they will thus cease to apply as from 1 January 2014.
The opening of similar quotas would be justified because they would cover the needs of the Canary Islands' domestic market, while ensuring
that flows of reduced-duty imports into the Union remain predictable and clearly identifiable.
In the light of the consultation of interested parties and the formal request submitted by the Spanish authorities, Members considered it
appropriate to extend the existing duty-free tariff quotas on imports of certain fishery products into the Canary Islands for the period
2014-2020.

2013/0266(CNS) - 10/12/2013 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 611 votes to 10, with 20 abstentions, in the framework of a special legislative procedure (consultation of
Parliament), a legislative resolution on the proposal for a Council regulation opening and providing for the administration of autonomous tariff
quotas of the Union on imports of certain fishery products into the Canary Islands from 2014 to 2020.
Following the Committee on Fisheries, Parliament approved the Commission proposal without amendment.

2013/0266(CNS) - 17/12/2013 Final act
CONTENT: to maintain the autonomous tariff quotas of the Union on imports of certain fishery products into the Canary Islands for a new
period of seven years, i.e. from 2014 to 2020.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Council Regulation (EU) No 1412/2013 opening and providing for the administration of autonomous Union tariff quotas for
imports of certain fishery products into the Canary Islands from 2014 to 2020.
CONTENT: the exceptional geographical situation of the Canary Islands in relation to the sources of supply of fishery products which are
essential for domestic consumption entails costs that are a severe burden for this sector.
This is why the Spanish government made a request for the prolongation of the measures under Council Regulation (EC) No 645/2008
opening and providing for the administration of autonomous Community tariff quotas on imports of certain fishery products into the Canary
Islands for the period from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013.
In September 2012, Spain requested the extension of Union tariff quotas for imports of certain fishery products into the Canary Islands. Tariff
quotas similar to those opened pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 645/2008 for certain fishery products are justified as they would cover the
needs of the Canary Islands' domestic market, while ensuring that flows of reduced-duty imports into the Union remain predictable and clearly
identifiable.

Therefore, with the aim of giving a long-term perspective to economic operators to reach a level of activity which stabilises the economic and
social environment of the Canary Islands, this Regulation extends, for an additional period of seven years (2014-2020), the autonomous tariff
quota regime of the Common Customs Tariff duties for the goods listed in the Annex to Council Regulation (EC) No 645/2008.
Measures are envisaged to ensure that:
the suspension shall be granted exclusively for fishery products intended for the Canary Islands' domestic market;
the Commission is kept regularly informed of the volume of imports in question so that, if necessary, it can take steps to prevent any
speculative movement or deflection of trade.
Where the Commission has reasons to believe that the suspensions laid down pursuant to this Regulation have led to a deflection of trade for
a specific product, it may adopt implementing acts, temporarily withdrawing the suspension for a period not exceeding 12 months.
By 30 June 2019, the Commission shall examine the impact of the measures and, on the basis of its findings, submit any relevant proposals
for the period after 31 December 2020.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 31.12.2013. It shall apply from 1 January 2014 until 31 December 2020.
