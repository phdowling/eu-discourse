Summary

2013/0241(NLE) - 10/07/2013 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to establish a joint technology initiative in the bio-industries field.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to
follow its opinion.
BACKGROUND: the framework programme for research and innovation Horizon 2020 encourages public-private partnerships (PPP) in
research and innovation with a view to tackling the major challenges facing Europe.
The Communication outlining the European Bioeconomy Strategy, adopted on 13 February 2012, proposes the creation of a Public-Private
Partnership (PPP) for bio-based industries (Bio-based PPP) as part of its Action Plan. The Commission Communication Promoting a stronger
European industry for growth and economic recovery reiterates the importance of setting up a Bio-based PPP in the form of a Joint
Technology Initiative (JTI) in the context of the EU's industrial policy
Bio-based industries are industries, which use renewable biological resources for the production of bio-based products and biofuels.
They are a cornerstone of the EU bioeconomy in generating growth and jobs and could make a significant contribution to the objectives of the
Europe 2020 Strategy.
The share of bio-based processes in all chemical production taken on its own is likely to increase from less than 2% in 2005 to 25% in 2025.
Furthermore, the volume growth of EU bio-based chemical products (including bio-plastics, bio-lubricants, bio-solvents, bio-surfactants and
chemical feedstock) will be at 5.3% per year up to 2020, resulting in a market worth EUR 40 billion and 90,000 jobs within the bio-chemical
industry alone.
The bio-industries and their value chains are complex as are the techno logical and innovation challenges that need to be overcome to unlock
their potential. As a nascent sector, bio-based industries have to overcome the dispersion of technical competences and the limited publicly
available data on real resource availability in order to build sustainable and competitive value chains. The establishment of a joint technology
initiative should enable critical mass to be achieved in a focused and coherent way at European level in terms of scale of activity, excellence
and potential for innovation.
IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the proposal is accompanied by a summary of the impact assessment.
LEGAL BASIS: Articles 187 and 188, first paragraph, of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
CONTENT: this proposal for a Regulation concerns the creation of a Bio-based Industries Joint Undertaking as a new scheme of
Public-Private Partnership between the Commission and the industry for to implement the joint technology initiative (JTI) for bio-industries.
The Bio-industries JU shall be created for a period that will end on 31 December 2024. Its headquarters will be in Brussels (Belgium). It will be
founded by the EU, represented by the European Commission, and the Bio-based Industries Consortium (BIC). The activities of the BBI JU will
be jointly funded by its founders. The Commission and BIC will contribute in equal parts to the running costs of the BBI JU.
The main objective of the JTI will be the transformation of non-edible parts of plants (e.g. wood, agricultural and forestry residues) and
biodegradable wastes into bio-based products and biofuels.
The specific objectives of the proposal are the following:
demonstrate technologies that enable new chemical building blocks, new materials, and new consumer products from European
biomass, which replace the need for fossil-based inputs;
develop business models that integrate economic actors along the value chain from supply of biomass to bio-refinery plants to
consumers of bio-based materials, chemicals and fuels, including through creating new cross-sector interconnections and supporting
cross-industry clusters; and
set-up flagship biorefinery plants that deploy the technologies and business models for bio-based materials, chemicals and fuels and
demonstrate cost and performance improvements to levels that are competitive with fossil-based alternatives.
The research and demonstration activities will be funded through contributions by the BIC member companies with monetary and
non-monetary resources (staff, equipment, consumables, etc.), and monetary resources from the EU. The level of EU resources will vary, in
line with Horizon 2020 rules, depending on the type of activity concerned.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the total budget of the BBI JU will be EUR 2 billion (including in cash and in kind contributions). In addition, the
industry has committed to invest EUR 1.8 billion in the establishment of large demonstration and flagship plants contributing to the objectives
of this JTI.
The maximum contribution from the European Union (including EFTA) will be EUR 1 billion, paid from the Horizon 2020 budget. The
administrative costs shall not exceed EUR 60 million for the duration of the JU.

2013/0241(NLE) - 05/02/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Industry, Research and Energy adopted, in the framework of a special legislative procedure (consultation of Parliament),
the report by Lambert van NISTELROOIJ (EPP, NL) on the proposal for a Council regulation on the Bio-Based Industries Joint Undertaking.
The committee approved the Commission proposal subject to the following amendments:
BBI Joint Undertaking: Members wanted to make it clear that in order to take account of the duration of the Horizon 2020 Framework
Programme for Research and Innovation (2014-2020), all calls for proposals should be launched by 31 December 2020.
Objectives: the BBI Joint Undertaking should have the following objectives:

·

addressing the research and innovation priorities laid down in Horizon 2020;

·

accelerating economic growth and increasing employment, in particularly in rural areas and areas with large biomass resources and
potential for developing bio-based products;

·

promoting the involvement of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs);

·

promoting large and small scale technology solutions that will accelerate their use at all levels of the bio-materials value chain, and
supporting innovation and the pursuit of new sources of growth that make it possible to take full advantage of intellectual capital;

·

contributing to the development of interregional and transnational cooperation;

·

setting up flagship biorefinery plants that deploy the sustainable technologies and sustainable business models for bio-based
materials, chemicals and fuels;

·

ensuring that the outcomes of research into innovative bio-economy technologies are communicated to all entities, including
individual farmers.

Scope of activities: Members inserted a new article to clarify the scope of activities of the Joint Undertaking, in particular with respect to the
relevant Technology Readiness Levels covered by its research programme. The Rules on Participation also call for a greater consideration of
the Technology Readiness Levels concept in relation to funding levels, which is taken up in this article with a view to the funding rates used in
indirect actions.
Financial contribution: the maximum Union contribution, including contributions from countries of the European Free Trade Association
(EFTA), to the BBI Joint Undertaking to cover administrative costs and operational costs should be EUR 950 million (rather than EUR 1 Billion
in the Commission proposal). The contribution should be paid from the appropriations in the general budget of the Union allocated to the
Horizon 2020 Framework Programme and in particular from appropriations allocated to the specific objectives "Leadership in enabling and
industrial technologies" and "Food security, sustainable agriculture and forestry, marine, maritime and inland water research, and the
bioeconomy"
Additional activities carried out by private members: while the additional activities to be carried out by private members are a welcome addition
to the leverage effect of the JTI, they should not be subject to auditing. Additional activities should be planned and carried-out accordingly,
determined clearly as in-kind contributions, and reported on annually.
Evaluation: by 30 June 2017 the Commission shall organise an independent interim evaluation of the BBI Joint Undertaking. The results of the
independent interim evaluation of the Bio-Based Industries Joint Undertaking should be taken into account in the interim evaluation of Horizon
2020.
In order to respond to unforeseen situations or to new developments and needs the Commission may, following the interim evaluation of
Horizon 2020 review the budget of the Bio-Based Industries Joint Undertaking within the annual budgetary procedure.
Rules for participation and dissemination: work plans of the BBI Joint Undertaking may derogate from the Rules for Participation laid down
in Horizon 2020 in order to facilitate and encourage the participation of specific types of participants, namely by limiting the allocation of
funding to SMEs, universities, non-profit research organisations, the JRC, and European interest organisations.
In accordance with the principles of transparency and non-discrimination, calls for proposals organised by the BBI Joint Undertaking shall be
published on the web-based Horizon 2020 Participant Portal.
Duty to divulge information: the report contains a new provision stating that Members of the staff of the Joint Undertaking, the Executive
Director, and members of the Governing Board shall, without delay, report such fraud as might have come to their knowledge in the
performance of their duties or office in OLAF provided that this disclosure does not render them liable to prosecution.
Coordination: the Commission should ensure constant coordination between the activities of Horizon 2020 and the activities of the BBI Joint
Undertaking by regularly identifying possible complementarities and synergies and by implementing a formal coordination process to fine-tune
research priorities.

2013/0241(NLE) - 15/04/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 563 votes to 29, with 81 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a Council regulation on
the Bio-Based Industries Joint Undertaking (BBI).

2013/0241(NLE) - 06/05/2014 Final act
PURPOSE: to establish a public-private partnership called the BBI Joint Undertaking for the implementation of the Joint Technology Initiative
on Bio-based Industries, in order to strengthen industrial research and innovation in the EU.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Council Regulation (EU) n° 560/2014 establishing the Bio-based Industries Joint Undertaking.
CONTENT: the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation, Horizon 2020, supports public-private partnerships in research and
innovation in order that the Union might tackle certain key challenges.
This Regulation aims to establish a new Joint Undertaking (JU) for the implementation of the Joint Technology Initiative on Bio-based
Industries for a period up to 31 December 2024.
The BBI JU is a body entrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership. Its seat will be located in Brussels, Belgium.
The founding members of the BBI Joint Undertaking should be the Union and the Bio-based Industries Consortium (BIC), a non-profit
organisation whose members cover the entire bio-based value chain and consist of large industries, small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs), regional clusters, European trade associations, and European Technology Platforms.
In order to take into account the duration of Horizon 2020, calls for proposals under the Joint Undertaking must be launched at the latest by 31
December 2020 (in duly justified cases, by 31 December 2021). Calls for proposals will be published on the single portal for participants as
well as through other Horizon 2020 electronic means of dissemination managed by the Commission.
The rules for participation and dissemination of the Horizon 2020 programme will apply to the JU.
Objectives of the JU: the BBI JU will contribute to the implementation of Horizon 2020. It will contribute to the objectives of the BBI Initiative of
a more resource efficient and sustainable low-carbon economy and increasing economic growth and employment, in particularly in rural areas,
by developing sustainable and competitive bio-based industries in Europe based on advanced bio refineries that source their biomass
sustainably. Those activities should be carried out through collaboration between stakeholders along the entire bio-based value chains,
including primary production and processing industries, consumer brands, SMEs, research and technology centres and universities.
To achieve maximum impact, the BBI Joint Undertaking should develop close synergies with other Union programmes in areas such as
