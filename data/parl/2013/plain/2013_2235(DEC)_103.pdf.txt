In 2012, the tasks and budget of this agency were as follows:

2013/2235(DEC) - 10/09/2013 Court of Auditors: opinion, report
PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the European Police Office (Europol) for the year 2012,
together with Europols reply.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit concerned, amongst others, the annual accounts of the European Police Office (Europol).
In the Courts opinion, the European Police Offices Annual Accounts fairly present, in all material respects, its financial position as of 31
December 2012 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions of its Financial
Regulation and the accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
The Court also considers that the transactions underlying the annual accounts of Europol for the financial year ended 31 December 2012 are,
in all material respects, legal and regular.
The report confirms that Europols 2012 budget amounted to EUR 84.2 million.
The report also makes a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of Europol, accompanied by the latters response.
The main observations may be summarised as follows:
The Courts observations:
·

carry-overs: Europol carried over EUR 1.2 million for changes to its building in connection with setting up the European cyber-crime
centre. Whilst it agreed these changes with the host state in July 2012, the contract for the works required was only signed in April
2013. Europol carried over EUR 16.3 million of committed appropriations (19.64 % of total committed appropriations) to 2013;

·

recruitment: the recruitment procedures examined showed certain shortcomings.

Europols reply:
·

carry-overs: amongst other things. Europol states it was entrusted with the responsibility for the European Cyber Crime Centre (EC3)
during the budget year of 2012. No appropriations were included for this new task in the original budget planning for the financial
year 2012 and by the end of 2012, it became clear that it would not be accompanied by additional resources in the budget 2013.
Consequently, commitments for this new task had to be taken on the budget 2012 at the end of the year which affected the amount
carried forward to 2013.

·

recruitment : Europol states in several comments that it conformed to the relevant rules on recruitment and the selection criteria
applicable.

The Court of Auditors report contains a summary of Europols activities in 2012. As the principal EU support centre for law enforcement
operations, Europol mainly focussed on:
operational support to operations and Joint Investigation Teams (JITs) including data processing, cross match reports,
technical/forensic support and expertise, mobile office deployments, analysis reports, operational coordination at Europol HQ,
operational meetings, financial assistance etc;
a substantial increase in the amount of operational support provided to Member States: 15 949 crossborder cases supported, an
increase of 16 % over 2011 (13 697).

2013/2235(DEC) - 20/03/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Petri SARVAMAA (EPP, FI) on discharge in respect of the implementation of the
budget of the European Police Office for the financial year 2012.
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the Authority for the financial
year 2012 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Members approve the closure of the Offices accounts.
However, they made a number of recommendations that need to be taken into account when the discharge is granted, in addition to the
general recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies:
·

Financing, budget and financial management: Members recall that the Office's overall budget for 2012 amounted to EUR 84.15
million. They also note that budget monitoring efforts during the financial year 2012 resulted in a budget implementation rate of 98.8
% and that the payment appropriations execution rate was 79.7 %.

·

Implementation rate of appropriations: the report observes that the Office carried over EUR1.2 million which were mostly related to
the new task assigned to the Office in June 2012 of running the European Cybercrime Centre, as well as EUR 100 000 related to the
introduction of a new human resources system. They regretted that commitments amounting to EUR 2 600 000 (out of EUR 15 000
000) carried over from 2011 had to be cancelled in 2012.

Members made a series of observations as regards the accounting system, procurement and recruitment procedures of this Agency. They
asked that the Office communicated the results and impact its work had on the European citizens in an accessible way, mainly through its
website.
Lastly, Members stressed the need to strengthen transparency and prevent conflicts of interests. They called on EUROPOL to make publicly
available the Declarations of Interests of certain members.

PURPOSE: to grant discharge to the European Police Office (EUROPOL) for the financial year 2012.

integral part of the discharge decision (please refer to the summary of the opinion of 3 April 2014).

the transactions of the Office and called on Europol to remedy this situation.
