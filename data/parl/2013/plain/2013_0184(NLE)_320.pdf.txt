OJ L 353 10.12.2014, p. 0009 Summary

2013/0184(NLE) - 11/06/2013 Initial legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to approve, on behalf of the EU, the Luxembourg Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on
Matters specific to Railway Rolling Stock, adopted in Luxembourg on 23 February 2007.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: the European Union is working towards the establishment of a common judicial area based on the principle of mutual

recognition of judicial decisions. The Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment (the "Cape Town Convention")
on matters specific to railway rolling stock, adopted in Luxembourg on 23 February 2007, makes a useful contribution to the regulation at
international level.
It is therefore desirable that the provisions of this instrument which concern matters falling within the exclusive competence of the European
Union should be applied as soon as possible.
That is the object of this proposal.
IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission proposes the approval of the Rail Protocol, after the EU signature in 2009, was preceded by
consultations with the Rail Working Group, a crossindustry association dedicated to the implementation of the Rail Protocol, whose Members
are, inter alia, Bombardier Transportation, Deutsche Bahn, English Welsh and Scottish Railways, European Investment Bank,
Intergovernmental Organisation for International Carriage by Rail (OTIF), UIC-International Union of Railways, Union of European Railway
Industries. During the consultations, it was particularly highlighted the close link between the conclusion of the Rail Protocol and the adoption
of the Fourth Railway Package on 30 January 2013.
LEGAL BASIS: Article 81(2), in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
CONTENT: with this proposal for a Decision, it is proposed that the European Union approves the Protocol to the Convention on International
Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Railway Rolling Stock adopted in Luxembourg on 23 February 2007.
Objective of the Cape Town Convention and its Protocol:
- The EU approved the accession to the Cape Town Convention and the Aircraft Protocol by Council Decision of 6 April 2009 and deposited
the instrument of accession on 28 April 2009. The Convention lays down uniform rules for the constitution and effects of an international
interest (security agreement, title reservation agreement or leasing agreement) in certain categories of mobile equipment designated in the
Protocols relating to the following categories: aircraft, railway rolling stock and space assets.
The instrument consists of the basic Convention laying down legal rules applicable to all categories of mobile equipment mobiles and a
number of specific Protocols containing special rules relating to particular types of equipment.
Given that these protocols may amend the Convention where the specific features of the relevant sector so require. It is accordingly the
Protocol and not the Convention that prevails as regards each category of mobile equipment. The Member States' obligations under the
Convention vary with the Protocol to which they accede.
- More specifically, the Protocol is intended to facilitate the financing of high-value railway rolling stock by creating a particularly strong
international guarantee for creditors (sellers on credit and institutions supplying credit for such sales) which gives them "absolute" priority over
these assets in an international register.
The Rail Protocol fixes certain rules concerning the priority and enforceability of registered international interests for certain types of creditors
financing rolling stock - i.e. the chargor, conditional seller or lessor. Furthermore the Protocol provides to creditors specific default remedies
(Article VII) and three alternatives for remedies on insolvency of the debtor (Article IX).
The Rail Protocol creates an international system of unique and unchangeable registration of international interests. The Protocol is
complementary to, and supportive of, the European Vehicle Identification Numbering system (adopted under the Railway Interoperability
Directive). It guarantees that the parties can register and search against their interests from wherever they are within the EU, using internet
thereby making the register accessible 24 hours/day.
Such an instrument is likely to be of great benefit to the European rail industry, banks and Governments by encouraging capital investment in
the rail sector and boosting the creation of a genuine lease market.
EU competences: the Commission negotiated the Rail Protocol on behalf of the European Community, for the parts falling within the exclusive
competence of the European Community.
Article XXII(1) of the Rail Protocol provides that Regional Economic Integration Organisations, which have competence over certain matters
governed by the Rail Protocol, may sign, accept, approve or accede to the said Protocol.
The Rail Protocol also covers certain questions governed by several European Regulations or Directives in force in regard to recognition and
enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, insolvency procedures and in the rail field.
The European Union has exclusive competence over some of the matters governed by the Rail Protocol , while the Member States have
competence over other matters governed by this instrument.
It is thus appropriate that the European Union approves the Rail Protocol.
Declarations of the Contracting States: Article XXII(2) of the Rail Protocol requires that, at the time of signature, acceptance, approval or
accession, the Regional Economic Integration Organisation make a general declaration indicating the matters covered by the Rail Protocol
which fall in respect of which competences have been transferred to that Organisation by its Member States.
The declaration on Community competence was made at the time of the signature of the instrument. A new declaration should be made at the
time of the approval, to take into account changes in legislation.
As regards declarations regarding issues relating to insolvency, the Commission considers that, where the primary insolvency jurisdiction is in
an EU Member State, it is Regulation No 1346/2000 of 29 May 2000 on insolvency proceedings that should, in any case, be applicable instead
of the Rail Protocol.
It is therefore proposed that the European Union should not make the declaration on insolvency assistance. The Member States keep their
competence concerning the rules of substantive law as regards insolvency.
Lastly, an article in the Protocol authorises, under certain conditions; Contracting States to make declarations on public service exemptions.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implications for the European Union's budget.

This is the aim of this proposal.
The Annex to this proposal contains a declaration to be made pursuant to Article XXII(2) concerning the competence of the European Union
over matters governed by the Rail Protocol, in respect of which the Member States have transferred their competence to the Union.

2013/0184(NLE) - 14/11/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Legal Affairs adopted the report by Heidi HAUTALA (Greens/EFA, FI) on the draft Council decision on the approval, on
behalf of the European Union, of the Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters specific to Railway
Rolling Stock, adopted in Luxembourg on 23 February 2007.
Members considered that the Rail Protocol is compatible with Union law and that the choice of legal bases for the proposal is correct. Article
81 TFEU provides for the adoption of measures for the approximation of laws and regulations of the member States in the field of judicial
cooperation in civil matters having cross-border implications in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure. Article 218(6) lays down the
procedure for concluding international agreements and determines when Parliament's consent is needed, which is the case as regards the
protocol in question.
Therefore, Members recommended the European Parliament to give its consent to the Protocol.

2013/0184(NLE) - 25/11/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 557 votes to 82, with 17 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the draft Council decision on the
approval, on behalf of the European Union, of the Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters
specific to Railway Rolling Stock, adopted in Luxembourg on 23 February 2007.
Parliament gave its consent to the Protocol.
