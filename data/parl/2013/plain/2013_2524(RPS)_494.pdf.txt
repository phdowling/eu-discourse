Summary

2013/2524(RPS) - 13/03/2013 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 409 votes to 247, with 19 abstentions, a resolution tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public
Health and Food Safety on the draft Commission implementing regulation amending Annexes II and III to Regulation (EC) No 110/2008 of the
European Parliament and the Council on the definition, description, presentation, labelling and the protection of geographical indications of
spirit drinks.
Parliament states that it opposes the adoption of this draft Commission Regulation amending Annexes II and III to Regulation (EC) No
110/2008 for the following reasons:
Minimum anethole level of 0.5 grams per litre: the Commission proposes to insert a definition of absinthe in Annex II of Regulation (EC) No
110/2008, which would provide for this minimum level of anethole. Parliament notes that the composition of absinthe depends a large degree
on regional availability of certain herbal plants and on varying consumer preferences, and not all traditional recipes contain a minimum
anethole level. The anethole level of many products currently available on the market remains below the 0.5 grams per litre proposed by the
Commission, and, as a result of this new definition, producers of absinthe variations would be required either to abstain from using the term
absinthe as their sales denomination or to change their long-standing recipes, notwithstanding their traditional methods of production.
Parliament warns that such a change of inherent product characteristics may irritate consumers and may hence undermine consumer
confidence.
Requirement for a quantity of thujone: the Commission proposes that the definition of absinthe include a requirement for a quantity of thujone
(alpha and beta) between 5 and 35 milligrams per litre. However, Parliament notes that in its opinion of 2 February 2002, the Commission's
Scientific Committee on Food did not consider it appropriate to use thujone as a chemically identified flavouring substance and supported the
application of the upper limits in foods and beverages which remain in place pursuant to Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1334/2008.
Accordingly Parliament considers the stipulation of a minimum thujone level as part of an absinthe definition is in contradiction to the current
paradigm for dealing with this potentially harmful substance. It notes, lastly, that some absinthe producers have started using Artemisia plants
that are free of thujone or contain only very low levels of this substance.
