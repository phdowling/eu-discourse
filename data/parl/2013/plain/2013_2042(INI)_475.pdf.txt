Summary

2013/2042(INI) - 25/09/2013 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Regional Development adopted the own-initiative report by Erminia MAZZONI (EPP, IT) on effects of budgetary constraints
for regional and local authorities regarding the EUs Structural Funds expenditure in the Member States.
Recalling the central role in financial fighting the crisis, the report stressed the importance of securing sufficient budgetary provisions in the
context of the MFF negotiations to the Structural and Investment Funds, noting in particular their key share of investment in areas such as
employment, innovation, sustainable development, the low-carbon economy and support to SMEs.
Financing capacity of the EUs regions and synergies between regional, national and EU level: Members are concerned that the prolonged
austerity measures and the strict economic governance carried out in 2011 and 2012, implying increased pressure and cuts on public budgets,
risks reducing the scope for local policies targeted at fulfilling Europe 2020.
Stressing the importance of adapting to ongoing budgetary constraints across Europe, the report insisted in the need to:
strengthen the administrative capacity of regional and local authorities, and for further efforts to reduce the red tape which also
adversely affects these authorities in their role as beneficiaries and restricts their capacity to implement EU-funded projects;
restore and improve financial capacity, at sub-national level and to provide adequate technical assistance, especially in implementing
locally led complex joint projects in order to secure public investment for programmes and projects aimed at boosting sustainable
growth, combating social exclusion and restoring the social fabric, providing adequate health and social services and securing jobs,
especially at regional and local level;
strengthen the administrative capacity of regional and local authorities;
simplify the rules and for increased flexibility and transparency in the programming and management of the Structural Funds;
strengthen synergies between national, sub-national, and European public spending budgets through clear establishment of the roles
and responsibilities of the different budgetary authorities at all different levels.
Economic governance of the EU and investment for growth and jobs: stressing the role that local and regional authorities could play in
achieving the Europe 2020 objectives of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, Members reiterated the importance of the partnership
between central authorities and regional and local authorities in setting priorities. In this context, they underlined the importance of the new
instrument for community-led local development, which would allow action groups at local level to develop and implement local strategies for
smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.
The Commission and the Member States are called upon to:
exploit all margins of flexibility existing within the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) to balance productive and
sustainable public investment needs with fiscal discipline objectives;
take into consideration in the context of the current negotiations on the future Economic and Monetary Union, all margins of flexibility
in the macro-economic governance framework in order to allow for productive investment, in particular by: (i) rethinking the
relationship between the Stability and Growth Pact and productive public investment; (ii) excluding public expenditure related to the
implementation of programmes co-financed by the Structural and Investment Funds in the framework of growth-friendly policies from
the budgetary surveillance rules under the Stability and Growth Pact.
The report called for public expenditure related to the implementation of programmes co-financed by the European Structural and Investment
Funds to be completely excluded from the definition of SGP structural deficits because this is expenditure devoted to achieving the goals of
Europe 2020 and supporting competitiveness, growth and job creation.
It called on the Commission to report on the scope for possible action within the boundaries of the existing EU fiscal framework in order to
address further the issue of separating current spending and investment in the budget deficit calculations.

2013/2042(INI) - 08/10/2013 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 433 votes to 41, with 50 abstentions, a resolution on the effects of budgetary constraints for regional and
local authorities regarding the EUs Structural Funds expenditure in the Member States.
Recalling the central role in financial fighting the crisis, Parliament stressed the importance of securing sufficient budgetary provisions in the
context of the MFF negotiations to the Structural and Investment Funds, noting in particular their key share of investment in areas such as
employment, innovation, sustainable development, the low-carbon economy and support to SMEs.

Economic governance of the EU and investment for growth and jobs: stressing the role that local and regional authorities could play in
achieving the Europe 2020 objectives of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, Members reiterated the importance of the partnership
between central authorities and regional and local authorities in setting priorities.
In this context, they underlined the importance of the new instrument for community-led local development, which would allow action groups at
local level to develop and implement local strategies for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.
Parliament reiterated its opposition to the introduction of macroeconomic conditionality in the Cohesion Policy 2014-2020 , which would
penalise regions and social groups already weakened by the crisis, with a suspension of payments possibly having disproportionate effects in
several Member States and especially in regions.
The Commission and the Member States are called upon to:
exploit all margins of flexibility existing within the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) to balance productive and
sustainable public investment needs with fiscal discipline objectives;
take into consideration in the context of the current negotiations on the future Economic and Monetary Union, all margins of flexibility
in the macro-economic governance framework in order to allow for productive investment, in particular by: (i) rethinking the
relationship between the Stability and Growth Pact and productive public investment; (ii) excluding public expenditure related to the
implementation of programmes co-financed by the Structural and Investment Funds in the framework of growth-friendly policies from
the budgetary surveillance rules under the Stability and Growth Pact.
The report called for public expenditure related to the implementation of programmes co-financed by the European Structural and Investment
Funds to be completely excluded from the definition of SGP structural deficits because this is expenditure devoted to achieving the goals of
Europe 2020 and supporting competitiveness, growth and job creation.
It called on the Commission to report on the scope for possible action within the boundaries of the existing EU fiscal framework in order to
address further the issue of separating current spending and investment in the budget deficit calculations.
Lastly, taking note of the IMF's recent comments that austerity weakens countries in which it is applied unthinkingly, Parliament agreed with
the IMF that the emphasis, instead of being confined to fiscal consolidation, should be broadened with a view to balancing consolidation with
growth.
