2013/2199(DEC) - 26/07/2013 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: presentation by the Commission of the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2012, as part of
the 2012 discharge procedure.
Analysis of the accounts of the EU Institutions: Section IV Court of Justice.
Legal reminder: the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the year 2012 have been prepared on the basis of the
information presented by the institutions and bodies under Article 129.2 of the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the
European Union. They were prepared in accordance with Title VII of this Financial Regulation and with the accounting principles, rules and
methods set out in the notes to the financial statements.
The objective of the financial statements is to provide information about the financial position, performance and cashflows of an entity that is
useful to a wide range of users. The objective is to provide information useful for decision making, and to demonstrate the accountability of the
entity for the resources entrusted to it.
1) Purpose: the document helps to bring insight into the EU budget mechanism and the way in which the budget has been managed and spent
in 2012. It recalls that the European Union's operational expenditure covers the various headings of the financial framework and takes different
forms, depending on how the money is paid out and managed. In accordance with the Financial Regulation, the Commission implements the
general budget using the following methods: direct or indirect centralised management (by means of bodies or agencies of public law or other);
decentralised management where the Commission delegates certain tasks for the implementation of the budget to third countries; and, thirdly,
shared management where budget implementation tasks are delegated to Member States, in areas such as agricultural expenditure and
structural actions.
The document also presents the different financial actors involved in the budget process (accounting officers, internal officers and authorising
officers) and recalls their respective roles in the context of the tasks of sound financial management.
Amongst the other legal elements relating to the implementation of the EU budget presented in this document, the paper focuses on the
following issues:
accounting principles applicable to the management of EU spending (business continuity, consistency of accounting methods,
comparability of information ...);
consolidation methods of figures for all major controlled entities (the consolidated financial statements of the EU comprise all
significant controlled entities institutions, organisations and agencies);
the recognition of financial assets in the EU (tangible and intangible assets, financial assets and other miscellaneous investments);
the way in which EU public expenditure is committed and spent, including pre-financing (cash advances intended for the benefit of an
EU organ);
the means of recovery following irregularities detected;
the modus operandi of the accounting system;
the audit process followed by the European Parliament's granting of the discharge.
To recap, the final control is the discharge of the budget for a given financial year. The discharge represents the political aspect of the external
control of budget implementation and is the decision by which the European Parliament, acting on a Council recommendation, "releases" the
Commission from its responsibility for management of a given budget by marking the end of that budget's existence. When granting the
discharge, Parliament may highlight some observations that it considers important, often by recommending that the Commission takes action
on the aspects in question.
The document also details specific expenditure of the institutions, in particular: i) pensions of former Members and functionaries of institutions;
ii) joint sickness insurance scheme and iii) buildings.
Lastly, the document presents a series of tables and detailed technical indicators on (i) the balance sheet; (ii) the economic outturn account;
(iii) cashflow tables; (iv) technical annexes concerning the financial statements.
2) Implementation of appropriations under Section IV of the budget for the financial year 2012: the document comprises a series of detailed
tables, the most important concerning the implementation of the budget. Concerning the expenditure of the Court of Justice, information drawn
from the "Annual Report 2012 of the Court of Justice of the European Union" shows that:
the total of commitments granted to this institution for 2012 was EUR 351 million of which EUR 345 was used;
the rate of payments was 98.36%.
3) Budgetary implementation conclusions: in more general and political terms, the Courts activity in 2012 concerned:
Intensity of legal activity: sustained productivity and a very significant improvement in efficiency as regards the duration of
proceedings. In addition, a slight decrease in the number of cases brought is to be noted, a fall which, having regard to the change in
the caseload over the last five years, could be rather short-term in nature. Thus, the Court completed 527 cases in 2012 (net figure), a
slight decrease compared with the previous year (550 cases completed in 2011). Of those cases, 357 were dealt with by judgments
and 168 gave rise to orders. The Court had 632 new cases brought before it which amounts to a decrease of approximately 8%
compared with 2011 (688 new cases) but nevertheless constitutes the second highest annual number of cases brought in the Courts
history. This decrease in the total number of cases brought relates principally to the slight decrease, compared with the previous year,

in the number of appeals lodged. As far as the duration of proceedings is concerned, the statistics are very positive. The average
duration amounted to 15.7 months and the average time taken to deal with direct actions and appeals was 19.7 months and 15.3
months respectively. The average time taken to deal with references for a preliminary ruling reached its shortest in 2012.
60 years of the Court of Justice (19522012): in the past year the Court completed 60 years of existence, throughout which it has
contributed to the European project. In this context, the Court published a collective work devoted to the role of the institution and of its
case-law in the construction of Europe, which was presented at a Forum to which the presidents of the constitutional and supreme
courts of the Member States of the European Union were invited.
New Rules of Procedure: in 2012 the Courts new Rules of Procedure and certain amendments to its Statute were adopted, following a
long but productive legislative process. These reforms are designed, first, to modernise procedures before the Court and, second, to
enable it to continue to improve its efficiency.
Partial replacement of the membership of the Court: 2012 saw a partial replacement of the membership of the Court and the departure
of four of its members. The governments of the Member States were again concerned, in this partial renewal, to make the
appointments without delay and to safeguard the stability of the institution as far as possible, thereby enabling it to continue smoothly
in the performance of its task.

2013/2199(DEC) - 21/03/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Tamás DEUTSCH (EPP, HU) in which it called on the European Parliament to
grant discharge to the Registrar of the Court of Justice for implementation of the Court of Justice's budget for the financial year 2012.
Members welcomed the fact that, on the basis of its audit work, the Court of Auditors concluded that the payments as a whole for the year
ended on 31 December 2012 for administrative and other expenditure of the institutions and bodies were free from material error. They
observed that no significant weaknesses had been identified in respect of the audited topics related to human resources and procurement for
the Court of Justice.
Budgetary and financial management: Members took note that in 2012, the Court of Justice had commitment appropriations amounting to EUR
343 567 692.52 and that the implementation rate of 98.63% was higher than in 2011.
Court of Justice cases: Members noted that the amount of pending and closed cases in the General Court has decreased slightly in 2012
when compared to previous years. They regretted that the number of closed cases has been decreasing (i.e. 714 closed cases in 2011 and
688 closed cases in 2012). They considered that the proposal for the creation of additional appointments of judges in the General Court, which
continues under examination in the Council, could contribute to the effective reduction of pending cases.
They emphasised the fact that the Court of Justice recognises that there is still a margin for improvement within the existing means at the
Court of Justice's disposal. They stressed that the internal reforms implemented in 2012, namely the creation of the new five-Judge chamber
and the new three-Judge chamber and the changes in the composition of the Grand Chamber, as well as the revision of the Rules of
Procedure, have contributed to certain changes in the system and that more can be done with further reforms.
Members urged the Court of Justice to find a way to properly manage the trend towards an increase in the number of new cases and heavy
workload as internal reforms and the revision of the Rules of Procedure alone will not be sufficient in the coming years to significantly
decrease the number of pending cases in the Court of Justice. They stressed that in the years when the mandate of more judges come to an
end, there is a high risk that productivity will decrease and that the continuity and stability of the Court of Justice's work will be affected if the
Council does not renew the mandate of the judges and if there is a delay in the appointment of the new judges.
e-Curia and translation services: Members noted that the Court of Justice has the highest proportion of staff working in the translation service
among all Union institutions, having 47.3% of its employees working as translators and interpreters. They stressed, however, that there is
room for the rationalisation of the translation services of the Court of Justice. Members acknowledged the benefits of the e-Curia application
and considered very positive that by the end of 2012, there were 1003 active users of e-Curia, among those 14 Member States, two European
Free Trade Association countries and five European institutions (in particular Parliament, the Council and the Commission). They regretted,
however, that there are still some Member States not using e-Curia to exchange documents with the Court of Justice.
Members called in addition for the following:
an overview of the number of cases pending since more than 24 months;
compliance with the rules concerning dignity in the workplace, including procedures for dealing with allegations of harassment;
the need for a greater geographical balance at all levels of the administration, in particular as regards the new Member States;
lowering the increases in expenditure on the Early Childhood Centre and the production and distribution of documents;
reducing the number of hearings with interpretation;
strengthening the ex post control of expenditure linked to the maintenance of infrastructure equipment and IT application;
the publication of the results and consequences of closed European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) cases where the institution or any of the
individuals working for it were subject of the investigation;
the clarification as regards buildings policy of the Court of Justice.

2013/2199(DEC) - 03/04/2014 Final act
PURPOSE: to grant discharge to the Court of Justice for the financial year 2012.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision 2014/553/EU of the European Parliament on discharge in respect of the implementation of the European
Unions General Budget, section IV Court of Justice, for the financial year 2012.
CONTENT: with the present decision, the European Parliament grants discharge to the Registrar of the Court of Justice in respect of the
implementation of the budget for the financial year 2012.
The decision is in line with the European Parliament's resolution adopted on 3 April 2014 and comprises a series of observations that form an
integral part of the discharge decision (please refer to the summary of the opinion of 3 April 2014).

Amongst the main observations made, Parliament urged the Court of Justice to find a way to properly manage the trend towards an increase
in the number of new cases and heavy workload as internal reforms and the revision of the Rules of Procedure alone will not be sufficient in
the coming years to significantly decrease the number of pending cases in the Court of Justice.

2013/2199(DEC) - 03/04/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a decision granting discharge to the Registrar of the Court of Justice for implementation of the Court of
Justice's budget for the financial year 2012.
In its resolution accompanying the discharge decision, adopted by 528 votes to 67 with 10 abstentions, Parliament welcomed the fact that, on
the basis of its audit work, the Court of Auditors concluded that the payments as a whole for the year ended on 31 December 2012 for

Lastly, Parliament welcomed the fact that the Court of Justice has adopted rules concerning dignity in the workplace, including procedures for
dealing with allegations of harassment. It also emphasised the fact that it is essential to maintain the best possible working environment for
staff and Members in the future.
