OJ L 349 21.12.2013, p. 0098 Summary

2013/0127(NLE) - 25/04/2013 Initial legislative proposal
PURPOSE : to accept an Amendment to Articles 25 and 26 of the Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and
International Lakes.
PROPOSED ACT : Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT : Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND : the UNECE Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes provides a legal
framework for cooperation on shared water resources in the UNECE region through integrated water resources management. Its purpose is to
establish a framework for bilateral or multilateral cooperation to prevent and control the pollution of transboundary watercourses and to ensure
the rational use of water by countries of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.
The Convention was signed on behalf of the European Community in Helsinki on 18 March 1992 and approved by Council Decision
95/308/EC of 24 July 1995.
The 2003 Meeting of Parties adopted the Amendment allowing the accession of any State that is a Member of the United Nations to accede to
the Convention upon approval by the Meeting of the Parties. The European Community and its Member States as Parties to the Convention
participated in the Meeting and supported the adoption of the Amendment. The amendment will enter into force upon acceptance by all States
and organisations that were Parties to the Convention on 28 November 2003.
Once the Amendment enters into force, the Convention will be of particular importance for countries that border the UNECE region, such as
Afghanistan, China, the Islamic Republic of Iran and certain Central Asian States. Some of these States have expressed an interest in
acceding to the Convention. Their participation in the Convention will be beneficial in encouraging cooperation on management of

transboundary water resources, especially in light of growing pressures of climate change, desertification as well as the importance of water
access for stability and security.
Following the adoption of an amendment in 2003, a vast majority of Parties to the Convention have already formally accepted it. The EU is one
of a small number of Parties to the Convention which have yet to accept the amendment.
In view of the above, it is appropriate for the European Union to now accept the Amendment in order to open the Convention globally and
enable accession of non UNECE countries willing to do so.
IMPACT ASSESSMENT : no impact assessment was undertaken.
LEGAL BASIS : Article 192(1), in conjunction with Article 218(6) (a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
CONTENT : under this proposal, the Amendment to Articles 25 and 26 of the Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary
Watercourses and International Lakes opening accession to the Convention to all UN Member States which has been adopted at the Third
Meeting of the Parties is hereby accepted on behalf of the Union.
The text of the Amendment is attached to this Decision.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATION : this proposal has no implications for the EU budget.

2013/0127(NLE) - 29/10/2013 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety adopted the report by Matthias GROOTE (S&D, DE) on the draft Council
decision on the acceptance on behalf of the European Union of the Amendment to Articles 25 and 26 of the Convention on the Protection and
Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes.
Members recommended the Parliament to consent, on behalf of the Union, to the amendment to Articles 25 and 26 of the UNECE Convention.
With the amendments in force, the Convention will be particularly important for countries bordering the UNECE region such as Afghanistan,
China, Iran and certain Central Asian States.

The European Parliament adopted a resolution on the draft Council decision on the acceptance on behalf of the European Union of the

PURPOSE: to accept an Amendment to the Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Council Decision 2013/790/EC on the acceptance on behalf of the European Union of the Amendment to Articles 25
and 26 of the Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes.
BACKGROUND: the European Union is a Party to the Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and
International Lakes following its approval in 1995.
The main purpose of the Convention is to establish a framework for bilateral and multilateral cooperation to prevent and control the pollution of
transboundary watercourses and to ensure the rational use of water resources in the Member countries of the United Nations Economic
Commission for Europe (UNECE).
At their 2003 Meeting, the Parties to the Convention expressed a wish to allow States situated outside of the UNECE region to become Parties
to the Convention in order to promote river basin cooperation throughout the world.
The European Community participated in the 2003 Meeting of the Parties which adopted the Amendment allowing accession of any State that
is a Member of the United Nations to accede to the Convention upon approval by the Meeting of the Parties. The Amendment will enter into
force upon acceptance of all States and organisations that were Parties to the Convention on 28 November 2003.
The Amendment should be accepted on behalf of the Union.
CONTENT: under this Decision, the Council, with the Parliaments consent, accepts on behalf of the Union, the Amendment to Articles 25 and
26 of the Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes opening accession to the Convention
to all United Nations Member States.
The Amendment is presented in the annex to this Decision.
Once the Amendment enters into force, the Convention will be of particular importance for countries that border the UNECE region, such as
Afghanistan, China, the Islamic Republic of Iran and certain Central Asian States. Some of these States have expressed an interest in
acceding to the Convention. Their participation in the Convention will be beneficial in encouraging cooperation on management of
transboundary water resources, especially in light of growing pressures of climate change, desertification as well as the importance of water
access for stability and security.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: the Decision shall enter into force on 13.12.2013.
