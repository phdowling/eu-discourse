Summary

The European Parliament adopted a resolution on the rule of law in Russia. The resolution was tabled by the S&D, Greens/EFA, ALDE, ECR,
GUE/NGL, and EPP groups.
It expresses serious concerns about the recent repressive laws and their arbitrary enforcement by the Russian authorities, and is deeply
worried by Russia's failure to observe its international legal obligations to protect freedom of association, expression and assembly, which is
posing a threat to both the viability of Russia's vibrant civil society and its cooperation with the EU. Members refer to several trials over the last
few years, such as the Magnitsky, Khodorkovsky and Politkovskaya cases, which have cast doubt on the independence of the judicial
institutions of the Russian Federation. They also refer to current trial of Alexei Navalny who has consistently exposed massive corruption
within the highest levels of the Russian state apparatus, and deplore the allegedly politically motivated nature of his prosecution.
Members also reaffirm their disappointment with the bill granting foreign agent status to Russian non-commercial organisations engaged in
political activities and financed from abroad. Parliament urges the Russian authorities to stop registering NGOs as foreign agents on the basis
of a law, which extended state control over NGOs, using the vague definition of political activities included in this law. Furthermore, it is deeply
concerned at the negative consequences of the adoption of a federal law on homosexual propaganda, which could increase discrimination and
violence against LGBTI individuals.
The resolution urges the Vice-President / High Representative, the EEAS, the Council and the Commission to:
·

continue to closely follow the above-mentioned cases, to raise these issues in different formats and meetings with Russia and to
report back to Parliament on their exchanges with the Russian authorities;

·

take into account, during the current negotiations on the next multiannual financial framework and during the programming phase,
the deteriorating situation for civil society, the forced withdrawal of other international donors and the increasing requests for EU
support, and to provide for a significant increase in the Union's financial support to NGOs and civil society accordingly;

·

implement an EU-wide visa ban and to freeze the financial assets in the EU of all officials involved in the death of Magnitsky, which
is being prosecuted posthumously, and of other serious human rights violators in Russia.

The Council is asked to adopt the EU Foreign Affairs Council's conclusions on human rights in Russia, which would serve to provide critical
support to all those in Russia working to protect human rights and also to bind the 27 EU Member States and EU institutions to a common
message and approach with regards to human rights in Russia.
Parliament asks Russia:
·

with regard to the March of Millions, to commission an independent inquiry into the Bolotnaya Square violence and, in particular, to
investigate allegations of excessive use of force against demonstrators;

·

to ensure freedom of the press and media, both online and offline, and to foster a pluralist media landscape;

·

to accept recommendations, made in the context of the Universal Periodic Review of Russia at the Human Rights Council, to repeal
legislation affecting the work of NGOs and to stop obstructing human rights work.

Lastly, Parliament welcomes the recent re-opening of proceedings in the case of the murder of Anna Politkovskaya, but shares the concern
that the question of who ordered the murder is unlikely to emerge from the case.
