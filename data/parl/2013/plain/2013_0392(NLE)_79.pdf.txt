2013/0392(NLE) - 13/11/2013 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to maintain for 2014 the employment guidelines adopted under Council Decision 2010/707/EU 2010 on guidelines for the
employment policies of the Member States.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to
follow its opinion.
BACKGROUND: on 26 March 2010, the European Council agreed to the European Commission's proposal to launch a new strategy for jobs
and growth, Europe 2020, based on enhanced coordination of economic policies, which will focus on the key areas where action is needed to
boost Europes potential for sustainable growth and competitiveness. To that end, the European Council agreed to set EU headline targets,
which constitute shared objectives guiding action of the Member States and of the Union.
The Treaty on the functioning of the EU provides that Member States are to regard their economic policies and promoting employment as
matters of common concern and coordinate them within the Council. In two distinct articles, it provides that the Council is to adopt broad
economic policy guidelines (Article 121) and employment guidelines (Article 148), specifying that the latter must be consistent with the former.
Given this legal basis, the guidelines for employment and economic policies are presented as two distinct but intrinsically interconnected legal
instruments:
A Council Recommendation on broad guidelines for the economic policies of the Member States and of the Union -Part I of the Europe
2020 Integrated Guidelines;
A Council Decision on guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States Part II of the Europe 2020 Integrated Guidelines.
These guidelines implemented by the above mentioned legal instruments form together the integrated guidelines for implementing the Europe
2020 strategy.
The employment guidelines were adopted on 21 October 2010, and as provided by the adoption decision should remain stable until 2014 to
ensure a focus on implementation.
The overall objectives and priorities expressed in the guidelines for the employment policies remain valid. Consequently, with this proposal, the
Commission maintains the guidelines adopted in 2010.

CONTENT: under this proposal, the Commission proposes that the guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States set out in the
Annex to Council Decision of 21 October 2010 on guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States are maintained for 2014 as
they were in 2011, 2012 and 2013. The employment guidelines shall be taken into account by the Member States in their employment policies.

2013/0392(NLE) - 19/12/2013 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs adopted, in the framework of a special legislative procedure (Parliament consultation) the
report by Pervenche BERÈS (S&D, FR) on the proposal for a Council decision on guidelines for the employment policies of the Member
States.
The committee recommended the European Parliament to approve, without amendment, the Commission proposal.

2013/0392(NLE) - 26/02/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 505 votes to 93, with 14 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a Council decision on
guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States.
Parliament approved the proposal without amendment.

2013/0392(NLE) - 06/05/2014 Final act
PURPOSE: to maintain for 2014 the employment guidelines adopted under Council Decision 2010/707/EU 2010 on guidelines for the
employment policies of the Member States.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Council Decision 2014/322/EU on guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States for 2014.
BACKGROUND: Article 145 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provides that Member States and the Union are to
work towards developing a coordinated strategy for employment and particularly for promoting a skilled, trained and adaptable workforce and
labour markets responsive to economic change.
The Europe 2020 strategy proposed by the Commission enables the Union to turn its economy towards smart, sustainable and inclusive
growth, accompanied by a high level of employment, productivity and social cohesion. On 13 July 2010, the Council adopted its
Recommendation on broad guidelines for the economic policies of the Member States and of the Union. Furthermore, on 21 October 2010, the
Council adopted its Decision 2010/707/EU. Those sets of guidelines form the integrated guidelines for implementing the Europe 2020 strategy.
The integrated guidelines give precise guidance to the Member States on defining their national reform programmes and on implementing
reforms. The employment guidelines should also form the basis for the establishment of the Joint Employment Report sent annually by the
Council and the Commission to the European Council.
The examination of the Member States' national reform programmes, contained in the Joint Employment Report adopted by the Council on 28
February 2013, shows that Member States should continue to make every effort to address the following priorities:
·

increasing labour market participation and reducing structural unemployment,

·

developing a skilled workforce responding to labour market needs,

·

promoting job quality and lifelong learning,

·

improving the performance of education and training systems at all levels,

·

increasing participation in tertiary education,

·

promoting social inclusion and

·

combating poverty.

The employment guidelines should remain stable until the end of 2014 to ensure a focus on their implementation. Until the end of 2014, any
updating of the employment guidelines should remain strictly limited. In 2011, 2012 and 2013 the employment guidelines were maintained.
They should be maintained for 2014.
