Summary

2013/2258(REG) - 10/12/2013 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament decided to append the following interpretation to Rule 202(5) of its Rules of Procedure concerning reports on
fact-finding visits for the investigation of petitions:
Fact-finding visits and the reports on those visits are aimed solely at providing the Committee with the requisite information to enable it to
consider the petition further. Such reports are drafted under the exclusive responsibility of the participants in the visit, who shall seek to reach
a consensus. Failing such a consensus, the report must set out the divergent findings of fact or assessments. The report is submitted to the
Committee for its approval by a single vote, unless the Chair declares, where appropriate, that amendments may be tabled to parts of the
report. Rule 52 does not apply to these reports, either directly or mutatis mutandis. In the absence of approval by the Committee, reports shall
not be forwarded to the President.
