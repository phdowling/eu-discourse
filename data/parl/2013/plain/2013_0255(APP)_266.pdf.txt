OJ L 283 31.10.2017, p. 0001 Summary

2013/0255(APP) - 17/07/2013 Initial legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to establish the European Public Prosecutor?s Office and lay down its competences and procedures.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: prosecuting offences against the EU budget is currently within the exclusive competence of Member States and no Union
authority exists in this area. National law enforcement efforts remain often fragmented in this area and the cross-border dimension of these
offences usually escapes the attention of the authorities.
Despite the intensified efforts of Union bodies, such as Eurojust, Europol and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), coordination,
cooperation and information exchange face numerous problems which are a major impediment to the effective investigation and prosecution of
offences affecting the Union?s financial interests.
As Member States' criminal investigation and prosecution authorities are currently unable to achieve an equivalent level of protection and
enforcement, the Union not only has the competence but also the obligation to act. Article 86 of the Treaty provides the necessary legal basis
for such a new Union-level prosecution system, the purpose of which is to correct the deficiencies of the current enforcement regime
exclusively based on national efforts and add consistency and coordination to these efforts.
IMPACT ASSESSMENT: according to the analysis of the Impact Assessment, setting up the European Public Prosecutor?s Office as a
decentralised integrated office of the Union, which relies on national judicial systems, offers the most benefits and generates the lowest costs.
LEGAL BASIS: Article 86 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
CONTENT: this proposal seeks to create a European Public Prosecutor?s Office, as well as to lay down its competences and procedures . It
complements a previous legislative proposal which defines which defines the criminal offences as well as the applicable sanctions.
The main elements of the proposed Regulation are the following:
Status, organisation and structure: the proposal provides for the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor?s Office in the form of a Union
body with a decentralised structure and with legal personality and sets out its relationship with Eurojust.
Independence: among the key features of the European Public Prosecutor?s Office, the text refers to its independence and accountability to

the European Parliament, Council and the European Commission in regard to its activities. In this context, it lays down special rules on the
appointment and dismissal of the European Public Prosecutor, his/her Deputies and European Delegated Prosecutors.
Tasks and competence: the task of the European Public Prosecutor will be to combat criminal offences affecting the financial interests of the
Union. It shall be responsible for investigating, prosecuting and bringing to judgment the perpetrators of, and accomplices in the criminal
offences and for exercising the functions of prosecutor in the competent courts of the Member States in respect of the offences affecting the
Union?s financial interests.
The proposal lays down the applicable penalties that fall within the material competence of the European Public Prosecutor. These offences
are to be defined by reference to national law implementing Union law.
Basic principles: the proposal describes the main legal principles that will govern the activities of the European Public Prosecutor?s Office,
including conformity with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, proportionality, national law being applicable to implement
the Regulation, procedural neutrality, legality and celerity of investigations, Member States? duty to assist the investigations and prosecutions
of the European Public Prosecutor?s Office.
Rules of procedure on investigations, prosecutions and trial proceedings: the proposal covers the essential features of the investigations and
prosecutions of the European Public Prosecutor?s Office, including provisions on how they should be controlled by national courts, what
decisions the European Public Prosecutor?s Office could take once the investigation is completed, how it would exercise its prosecution
functions and how the evidence collected would be used in trial courts.
Procedural safeguards: the proposal provides safeguards for suspects and other persons involved in the proceedings of the European Public
Prosecutor?s Office, which will need to comply with the relevant standards, in particular the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European
Union.
With regard to certain rights ? right to interpretation and translation; right to information in criminal proceedings; right of access to a lawyer in
criminal proceedings and the right to communicate upon arrest ? the rules refer to Union legislation. The proposal also defines autonomously
other rights which have not yet been regulated in Union legislation, such as the right to remain silent and the right to be presumed innocent,
the right to legal aid, the right to present evidence, appoint experts and hear witnesses.
As such, these rules provide an additional layer of protection compared to national law.
The proposal also lays down the rules governing the data protection regime. The supervision of all personal data processing in the context of
the activities of the European Public Prosecutor?s Office has been entrusted to the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS).
BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal seeks to be cost-efficient for the EU budget: part of OLAF's current resources will be used for
setting up the central headquarters of the European Public Prosecutor?s Office, which in turn will rely on the administrative support of Eurojust.
Limited additional costs will arise in relation to the position of the European Delegated Prosecutors who will be located in the Member States
and will be an integral part of the European Public Prosecutor's Office.
As the set-up phase of the European Public Prosecutor?s Office will probably take several years, staff members will be gradually transferred
from OLAF to the European Public Prosecutor?s Office. The European Public Prosecutor's Office will reach cruising speed once the full staff
levels are achieved. The full staff level will be achieved in 2023 with 235 staff, of which 180 establishment plan posts and 55 external staff. The
estimated cost for 2023 with this staff level is approximately EUR 35 million .

2013/0255(APP) - 27/11/2013 Document attached to the procedure
On 17 July 2013, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Council Regulation on the establishment of the European Public Prosecutor's
Office, based on Article 86 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which empowers the Council to establish that
Office in order to combat crimes affecting the financial interests of the Union.
Within the deadline laid down in Article 6 of Protocol No 2, fourteen chambers of national Parliaments sent reasoned opinions to the
Commission, thus triggering the subsidiarity control mechanism provided for in Article 7(2) of Protocol No 2, which the Commission confirmed
on 6 November 2013.
In this paper, it reviews the proposal, carefully analysing the reasoned opinions submitted by national Parliaments from the perspective of the
principle of subsidiarity.
The subsidiarity test involves two closely interrelated questions:
·

whether the proposed action can or cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States acting on their own;

·

whether the action can be, by reason of its scale or effects, better achieved at Union level.

The paper examines whether the insufficiency of Member State action and the added-value of Union action justify the establishment of the
European Public Prosecutor's Office. That issue is judged in light of the different aspects of the proposal, i.e. the way in which the Office
would be established and the rules and procedural powers that would frame it.
The Commission concludes that its proposal complies with the principle of subsidiarity enshrined in Article 5(3) TEU and that a withdrawal or
an amendment of that proposal is not required. The Commission therefore maintains it. During the legislative process the Commission will,
however, take due account of the reasoned opinions of the national Parliaments.

2013/0255(APP) - 24/02/2014 Committee interim report tabled for plenary
The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs adopted an interim report by Salvatore IACOLINO (EPP, IT) on the proposal for a
Council regulation on the establishment of the European Public Prosecutors Office.
The aim of this report in line with the provisions of the Lisbon Treaty is to draw up a number of suggestions and provide specific details of a

political nature relating to the text proposed by the Commission, which may be carefully considered by the Council.
The Committee on Budgetary Control, exercising its prerogatives as an associated committee under Parliaments Rule 50 of the Rules of
Procedure, also gave an opinion on the report.
Members considered that the European Parliament should be extensively involved in the discussion and in the framing of the proposal under
consideration, and that the co-legislator will carefully consider the remarks made and solutions identified. They called on the Council to take
due account of the following recommendations:
clearly establish in advance the non-discretionary criteria determining which competent court is to exert jurisdiction,
give the European Public Prosecutors Office full independence both from national governments and from EU institutions;
precisely determine the scope of the competence of the EPPO to enable the criminal acts that fall within that scope to be identified
beforehand and for definitions set out in the Commission proposal, concerning ancillary competence to be carefully reviewed;
specify that the European Public Prosecutor cannot prosecute offences which are not yet set out in the relevant Member States law at
the time of the offence;
define in a detailed manner the criteria for the use of investigative measures should be spelled out in more detail in order to ensure
that forum shopping is excluded;
ensure that the conditions for admissibility of evidence should be such as to respect all rights guaranteed by the Charter of
Fundamental Rights of the European Union, the European Convention on Human Rights, and the European Court of Human Rights
case law;
maintain the right to an effective judicial remedy at all times in respect of the European Public Prosecutors activity throughout the
Union;
specify that after the dismissal by the European Public Prosecutor of a case relating to minor offences, the national prosecution
authorities are not prevented from further investigating and prosecuting the case should they be allowed to under their national laws
and that the where a lack of relevant evidence cannot foreseeably be remedied by further proportionate investigative steps dismissal
is mandatory.
The report recommended that the Council should: take account of the fact that all activities of the European Public Prosecutors Office should
ensure a high protection of the rights of defence; (ii) comply with the ne bis in idem principle should be ensured; (iii) ensure that the
organisational model of the EPPO should ensure at central level the appropriate skills, experience and knowledge of the legal systems of the
Member States.
Lastly, the Council is called upon to clarify the competence of each existing body in charge of protecting the Unions financial interests; points
out that it is of the utmost importance that the relationship between the EPPO and other existing bodies, such as Eurojust and OLAF, be
further defined and clearly demarcated.

2013/0255(APP) - 12/03/2014 Interim resolution adopted by Parliament
The European Parliament adopted by 487 votes to 161 with 30 abstentions, a resolution on the proposal for a Council regulation on the
establishment of the European Public Prosecutors Office.
The resolution aims to draw up a number of suggestions and provide specific details of a political nature relating to the text proposed by the
Commission, which will be considered by the Council.
Parliament stressed that the proposal to establish a European Public Prosecutors Office represented a further step towards the establishment
of a European area of criminal justice and that its main objective was to contribute to strengthening protection for the financial interests of the
Union, while respecting the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
Trcalling that 14 national parliamentary chambers from 11 Member States have triggered the yellow card in relation to the Commission
proposal, Parliament considered that the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor's Office could give a particular added value to the
Area of Freedom, Security and Justice, assuming that all Member States participate.
Given that the establishment of a European Public Prosecutors Office (EPPO) was the only act under the criminal justice system for which the
ordinary legislative procedure would not be applicable, Parliament called on the Council to extensively involve Parliament in its legislative work
and ensure that the latters position is duly taken into account at all stages of the procedure. It called on the Council to take due account of the
following recommendations:
clearly establish in advance the non-discretionary criteria determining which competent court is to exert jurisdiction, take into account
the rights of the suspect and ensure that the determination of competence be subject to judicial review;
give the European Public Prosecutors Office full independence both from national governments and from EU institutions;
precisely determine the scope of the competence of the EPPO to enable the criminal acts that fall within that scope to be identified
beforehand and for definitions set out in the Commission proposal, concerning ancillary competence to be carefully reviewed;
specify that the European Public Prosecutor cannot prosecute offences which are not yet set out in the relevant Member States law at
the time of the offence;
define in a detailed manner the criteria for the use of investigative measures should be spelled out in more detail in order to ensure
that forum shopping is excluded;
ensure that the conditions for admissibility of evidence should be such as to respect all rights guaranteed by the Charter of
Fundamental Rights of the European Union, the European Convention on Human Rights, and the European Court of Human Rights
case law;
maintain the right to an effective judicial remedy at all times in respect of the European Public Prosecutors activity throughout the
Union;
specify that after the dismissal by the European Public Prosecutor of a case relating to minor offences, the national prosecution
authorities are not prevented from further investigating and prosecuting the case should they be allowed to under their national laws
and that the where a lack of relevant evidence cannot foreseeably be remedied by further proportionate investigative steps dismissal
is mandatory.

Parliament also recommended that the Council should: (i) take account of the fact that all activities of the European Public Prosecutors Office
should ensure a degree of high protection of the rights of defence; (ii) comply with the ne bis in idem principle; (iii) pay particular attention to
the rights of the data subject where personal data are transferred to third countries or international organisations; (iv) ensure that the
organisational model of the EPPO should ensure at central level the appropriate skills, experience and knowledge of the legal systems of the
Member States.
Members asked the Council to clarify the competence of each existing body in charge of protecting the Unions financial interests. They pointed
out that it was of the utmost importance that the relationship between the EPPO and other existing bodies, such as Eurojust and OLAF, be
further defined and clearly demarcated.
Lastly, considering that the consistency of overall EU action in the field of justice was vital Members called on the European legislator to deal
with this proposal in the light of others that were closely linked to it, such as the proposal for a directive on the fight against fraud to the Unions
financial interests by means of criminal law, the proposal for a regulation on the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation
(Eurojust) and other relevant instruments in the field of criminal justice and procedural rights.

2013/0255(APP) - 19/03/2015 Committee interim report tabled for plenary
The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs adopted the interim report by Monica MACOVEI (PPE, RO) on the proposal for a
Council regulation on the establishment of the European Public Prosecutors Office (EPPO).
In its resolution of 12 March 2014, the Parliament called on the Council to be extensively involved in its work and made a number of political
suggestions addressing some of the most crucial aspects at stake: structure, independence, decision making process, competence,
investigation tools, admissibility of evidence, judicial review, legal protection.
This new interim report is intended to complement the resolution of 12 March. Members reaffirmed their strong willingness to address the
priorities for the establishment of the EPPO and to identify the principles and conditions under which it may give its consent.
The report calls on the Council to ensure transparency and democratic legitimacy by keeping Parliament fully informed and regularly
consulting it. It deems it crucial to ensure the establishment of a single, strong, independent EPPO that is able to investigate, prosecute and
bring to court the perpetrators of criminal offences affecting the Unions financial interests.
Members recalled that that the relevant criminal offences are to be set out in the proposed directive on the fight against fraud to the Unions
financial interests by means of criminal law (PFI Directive). It calls on the Council to renew its efforts to find agreement on the latter for the
establishment of the EPPO.
The main recommendations presented to the Council are as follows:
An independent European Public Prosecutors Office:
·

the EPPO should be fully independent of national governments and the EU institutions; the selection and appointment procedures for
the European Chief Prosecutor, his/her deputies, the European Prosecutors and the European Delegated Prosecutors should be
open, objective and transparent;

·

the European Prosecutors should be appointed by the Council and Parliament by common accord on the basis of a shortlist drawn
up by the Commission, following an evaluation by an independent panel of experts chosen from among judges, prosecutors and
lawyers of recognised competence.

A clear division of jurisdiction between the EPPO and national authorities:
·

the EPPO should first decide whether it has competence and before national authorities initiate their own investigations, in order to
avoid parallel investigations which are inefficient;

·

the national authorities that carry out investigations of offences which may fall under the competence of the EPPO should be obliged
to inform it of any such investigations;

·

the powers of the European Public Prosecutor's Office should extend to offences other than those affecting the Unions financial
interests on certain conditions.

An efficient structure for the effective management of cases:
·

Members find it regrettable that the option of a collegiate structure is being considered by the Member States, instead of the
hierarchical one initially proposed by the Commission;

·

the Chambers should play a leading role in investigations and prosecutions and supervise the work of the European Delegated
Prosecutors in the field.

Investigative measures and admissibility of evidence:
·

the legislator should guarantee streamlined procedures for the EPPO to obtain authorisation for investigative measures in
cross-border cases;

·

the Council should ensure the admissibility of the evidence gathered by the EPPO with full respect for the relevant European and
national legislation across the Union;

·

EPPO should seek out all relevant evidence, whether inculpatory or exculpatory; suspects or accused persons in any investigation
undertaken by the EPPO should be granted certain rights concerning evidence;

·

the principle of ne bis in idem should be respected with regard to prosecutions involving offences which fall under the competence of
the EPPO.

Coherent legal protection for suspects or accused persons:

·

the new Office should carry out its activities with full respect for the rights of suspects or accused persons which are enshrined in
Article 6 TEU, Article 16 TFEU and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union;

·

effective access to legal aid in accordance with the relevant national laws;

·

any specific provisions on data protection contained in the Council regulation on the establishment of the EPPO may only
complement and further elaborate the provisions contained in Regulation 2001/45, and only to the extent that it is necessary.

The report urges the Council to follow these recommendations and underlines the fact that the aforementioned conditions are essential for
Parliament to give its consent to the Councils draft regulation.

2013/0255(APP) - 29/04/2015 Interim resolution adopted by Parliament
The European Parliament adopted by 487 votes to 165, with 33 abstentions, a resolution on the proposal for a Council regulation on the
establishment of the European Public Prosecutors Office (EPPO).
Parliament confirmed the content of its previous interim report, adopted in its resolution of 12 March 2014 while reaffirming its determination to
achieve the priorities necessary to the establishment of the European Prosecutor, as well as to set the principles and the conditions that
determine its approval. It called on the Council to ensure transparency and democratic legitimacy by keeping the Parliament fully informed and
consulting it regularly. Members called on the Council to ensure transparency and democratic legitimacy by keeping Parliament fully informed

Members endorsed the establishment of a single, strong, independent EPPO that is able to investigate, prosecute and bring to court the
perpetrators of criminal offences affecting the Unions financial interests. They recalled that that the relevant criminal offences are to be set out
in the proposed Directive on the fight against fraud to the Union's financial interests by means of criminal law. The Council was invited to
renew its efforts to find agreement on the latter for the establishment of the EPPO.
The main recommendations presented to the Council are as follows:
An independent European Public Prosecutors Office:
the EPPO should be fully independent of national governments and the EU institution and protected from political influence and
pressures; the selection and appointment procedures should be objective and transparent;
the European Prosecutors should be appointed by the Council and Parliament by common accord on the basis of a shortlist drawn up
by the Commission, following an evaluation by an independent panel of experts chosen from among judges, prosecutors and lawyers
of recognised competence.
A clear division of jurisdiction between the EPPO and national authorities:
the EPPO should first decide whether it has competence and before national authorities initiate their own investigations, in order to

the powers of the EPPO should extend to offences other than those affecting the Unions financial interests on certain conditions.
An efficient structure for the effective management of cases:
Members find it regrettable that the option of a collegiate structure is being considered by the Member States, instead of the
hierarchical one initially proposed by the Commission;
the Chambers should play a leading role in investigations and prosecutions and supervise the work of the European Delegated
Prosecutors in the field; the system for allocating cases among the Chambers should follow predetermined and objective criteria.
Investigative measures and admissibility of evidence:
the legislator should guarantee streamlined procedures for the EPPO to obtain authorisation for investigative measures in
cross-border cases, in accordance with the law of the Member States comcerned;
the Council should ensure the admissibility of the evidence gathered by the EPPO with full respect for the relevant European and
national legislation across the Union;
EPPO should seek out all relevant evidence, whether inculpatory or exculpatory; suspects or accused persons in any investigation
undertaken by the EPPO should be granted certain rights concerning evidence;
the principle of ne bis in idem should be respected with regard to prosecutions involving offences which fall under the competence of

any specific provisions on data protection contained in the Council regulation on the establishment of the EPPO may only complement
and further elaborate the provisions contained in Regulation 2001/45, and only to the extent that it is necessary.
Parliament urged the Council to follow these recommendations and underlined the fact that the aforementioned conditions are essential for
Parliament to give its consent to the Councils draft regulation.

2013/0255(APP) - 30/06/2017 Legislative proposal

PURPOSE: to implement enhanced cooperation on the establishment of the European Public Prosecutors Office (the EPPO).
PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: the Union and its Member States have an obligation to protect the financial interests of the Union against criminal offences.
These offences cause significant financial loss each year. The current situation, in which the authorities of the Member States alone have the
power to institute criminal proceedings against infringements affecting the financial interests of the Union, does not always sufficiently achieve
that objective.
The European Public Prosecutor's Office would make it possible to remedy these shortcomings and improve the fight against offences
affecting the financial interests of the EU, thus contributing to better protection of the Union's budget.
On 17 July 2013, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Council Regulation on the establishment of the EPPO. The possibility of setting up
the European Public Prosecutor's Office is foreseen by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) in the Title concerning the
area of freedom, security and justice.
The enhanced cooperation procedure was launched on 3 April 2017 following the Councils finding that there was no unanimous agreement on
the Commission proposal.
So far, 16 Member States have notified their wish to establish closer cooperation on the creation of the European Public Prosecutor's Office:
Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Portugal, the Czech Republic, Romania,
Slovakia and Slovenia.
In addition, 4 other Member States, namely Latvia, Estonia, Austria and Italy, have expressed their intention to join the enhanced cooperation.
The other Member States may join the cooperation at any time.
CONTENT: the draft Regulation presented by the Council aims to establish the European Public Prosecutor's Office and lay down its operating
conditions.
Tasks: the EPPO shall be responsible for investigating, prosecuting and bringing to judgment the perpetrators of, and accomplices to, criminal
offences affecting the financial interests of the Union. In that respect the EPPO shall undertake investigations, and carry out acts of
prosecution and exercise the functions of prosecutor in the competent courts of the Member States, until the case has been finally disposed of.
It shall act independently and be accountable to the institutions of the Union.
The proposed Regulation provides for a system of shared competence between the EPPO and national authorities in combating crimes
affecting the financial interests of the Union. In the light of the principle of sincere cooperation, both the EPPO and the competent national
authorities should support and inform each other with the aim of efficiently combatting the crimes falling under the competence of the EPPO.
The EPPO shall cooperate closely with the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and Eurojust within the framework of their respective mandates
and the exchange of information. In agreement with the competent authorities concerned, it may also designate contact points in the Member
States of the European Union who do not participate in enhanced cooperation in order to facilitate cooperation.
Structure and organisation: the EPPO shall be an indivisible Union body operating as one single Office with a decentralised structure:
the central level shall consist of a Central Office at the seat of the EPPO. The Central Office shall consist of the College, the
Permanent Chambers, the European Chief Prosecutor, the Deputy European Chief Prosecutors, the European Prosecutors and the
Administrative Director;
the decentralised level shall consist of European Delegated Prosecutors who shall be located in the Member States.
The Central Office and the European Delegated Prosecutors shall be assisted by the staff of the EPPO in their duties under this Regulation.
The European Parliament and the Council shall appoint by common accord the European Chief Prosecutor for a non-renewable term of seven
years. The Council shall act by simple majority.
Operating conditions: provisions for the establishment of the European Public Prosecutor's Office in Luxembourg would be laid down in a
Headquarters Agreement concluded between the EPPO and Luxembourg by the date the EPPO assumes its investigative and prosecutorial
tasks determined.
Entry into force: the proposal foresees that the European Public Prosecutors Office shall exercise its competence with regard to any offence
under its remit after the date of entry into force of the Regulation.
The EPPO shall assume the investigative and prosecutorial tasks conferred on it by this Regulation on a date to be determined by a decision
of the Commission on a proposal of the European Chief Prosecutor once the EPPO is set up. The date to be set by the Commission shall not
be earlier than three years after the date of entry into force of this Regulation.

2013/0255(APP) - 29/09/2017 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs adopted the report by Barbara MATERA (EPP, IT) on the draft Council Regulation
implementing enhanced cooperation on the establishment of the European Public Prosecutors Office.
The committee recommended Parliament to give its consent to the draft Council Regulation.
In the explanatory memorandum accompanying the recommendation, it is recalled that Parliament adopted three interim reports (2014, 2015
and 2016) on the European Public Prosecutors Office (EPPO). These reports raised a number of concerns regarding the competences of the
EPPO, PIF directive and VAT fraud, structure, investigations, procedural rights, judicial review and relations with other relevant EU agencies.
The Regulation could have been more ambitious. However, Parliaments concerns have largely been taken into account in the text in its
present form. The following points are highlighted:

the EPPO shall be a body of the Union with a decentralised structure with the aim of integrating the national law enforcement
authorities;
the set of competences and proceedings for the EPPO, include the proposed directive on fighting fraud against the Unions financial
interests by means of criminal law (PIF directive);
serious cases of cross-border VAT fraud shall be included in the scope of the directive, setting the threshold value at EUR 10 million;
the EPPO Regulation shall ensure a comprehensive system of judicial review by national courts and allows for possibilities of direct
review by the European Court of Justice;
the EPPO shall have sufficient investigative measures available to conduct its investigations. The co-legislators agreed on criteria for
Member States to make requests for investigative measures based on the principle of mutual recognition set out in Directive
2014/41/EU regarding the European Investigation Order in criminal matters;
in full compliance with the rights of suspects and accused persons enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the Regulation
shall provide for rights of defence for EPPO suspects, in particular the right to legal aid, the right to interpretation and translation, the
right to information and access to case materials, and the right to present evidence and to ask the EPPO to collect evidence on behalf
of the suspect;
the EPPO shall establish and maintain cooperative relations with existing Union agencies, offices or bodies such as Eurojust, OLAF
and Europol;
the Council included in the Regulation the request for non-participating Member States to notify the EPPO as a competent authority for
the purpose to respect the judicial cooperation in criminal matters.
While regretting that not all EU Member States are involved in the establishment of the European Public Prosecutor Office, the rapporteur
nevertheless welcomed the fact that 20 of them reached a general approach, including fraud against the Unions financial interests, in
particular, serious VAT fraud. Non-participating Member States are encouraged to take part in enhanced cooperation in the future.

2013/0255(APP) - 05/10/2017 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading

Regulation.
The draft Regulation seeks to implement enhanced cooperation between 20 Member States regarding the creation of the European Public
Prosecutor's Office. The EPPO will be responsible for investigating, prosecuting and bringing to judgment the perpetrators of offences against
the Unions financial interests.
