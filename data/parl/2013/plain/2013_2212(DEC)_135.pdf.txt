2013/2212(DEC) - 26/07/2013 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: presentation by the Commission of the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2012, as part of
the 2012 discharge procedure.
Analysis of the accounts of the European Environment Agency (EEA).
CONTENT: this Commission document sets out the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2012 as
prepared on the basis of the information presented by the institutions, organisations and bodies of the EU, in accordance with Article 129 (2) of
the Financial Regulation applicable to the EU's General Budget, including the European Environment Agency (EEA).
In 2012, the tasks and budget of this agency were as follows:
description of the Agency's tasks: the European Environment Agency, which is located in Copenhagen, was established by Council
Regulation (EEC) No 1210/90. It is responsible for setting up an observation network to provide the Commission, the Parliament, the
Member States and, more generally, the public with reliable information on the state of the environment. This information should, in
particular, enable the European Union and the Member States to take action to safeguard the environment and assess the
effectiveness of such action. Its main task is to report on the quality of and pressures on the environment within the territory of the
Union;
the Agency's budget for the financial year 2012: the Agencys budget for 2012, as presented in the Commission document on the
consolidated annual accounts of the European Union, gives the following figures:
§

Commitment appropriations :
- committed : EUR 69 million;
- paid : EUR 52 million;
- carried-over : EUR 16 million.

§

Payment appropriations :
- committed : EUR 73 million;
- paid : EUR 45 million;
- carried-over : EUR 27 million.

Please refer also to the final accounts of the EEA.

2013/2212(DEC) - 10/09/2013 Court of Auditors: opinion, report
PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the European Environment Agency for the financial year
2012, together with the Agencys reply.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit concerned, amongst others, the annual accounts of the European Environment Agency (EEA).
In the Courts opinion, the Agencys Annual Accounts fairly present, in all material respects, its financial position as of 31 December 2012 and
the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions of its financial rules and the
accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
The Court also considers that the transactions underlying the annual accounts of the Agency for the financial year ended 31 December 2012
are, in all material respects, legal and regular.
The report confirms that the resources made available to the Agency in 2012 amounted to EUR 41.7 million.
The report also makes a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of the Agency, accompanied by the latters
response. The main observations may be summarised as follows:
The Courts observations:
internal controls: in 2012, the Agency awarded grants under three major grant programmes to consortia consisting of environmental
institutions and bodies in Europe, UN organisations and national environment organisations. Total grant expenditure in 2012 was EUR
11.9 million, representing 27% of the total operating expenditure. The Agencys ex ante verifications before reimbursement of costs
claimed by beneficiaries consist of a desk analysis of cost claims. It does not usually obtain from beneficiaries any document to
substantiate the eligibility and accuracy of the staff costs claimed, which represent the main part of costs. Ex ante on-the-spot
verifications of costs at beneficiary level are rare. Existing controls therefore provide only limited assurance to the Agencys
management as to the eligibility and accuracy of the costs claimed by beneficiaries. Improvements in this area are necessary.
The Agencys replies:
audits: the Agency states that over the past decades, the EEA has accumulated a vast experience in dealing with grant agreements
and the cost structure of especially the European Topic Centres. Hence, there is a solid basis upon which cost statements (including
staff costs) are evaluated. However, we acknowledge the European Court of Auditors observation and, based upon a further risk
analysis, an action plan has been drawn up to ensure reasonable assurance. The call for proposals launched in 2013 includes a
revised framework partnership agreement in which contractual provisions have been updated. The EEA has decided to increase the
number of on-the-spot verifications in line with the Court of Auditors recommendation.
Lastly, the Court of Auditors report contains a summary of the Agencys activities in 2012. This is focused on the following:
production of press releases;
data sets;
promotional material;
corporate documents and reports;
pan-European assessments;
the state of the Environment report (SOER 2010).

2013/2212(DEC) - 21/03/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Petri SARVAMAA (EPP, FI) in which it recommended the European Parliament to
grant discharge to the Executive Director of the European Environment Agency in respect of the implementation of the Agency's budget for the
financial year 2012.
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the Agency for the financial
year 2012 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Members approved the closure of the Agencys accounts.
They made, however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is granted, in addition to the
general recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies.
Budget and financial management: Members noted that budget monitoring efforts during the financial year 2012 resulted in a budget
implementation rate of 99.19% and that the payment appropriations execution rate was 89.41%. They regretted that for the year 2012,
the mission expenses of the Executive Director of the Agency were remarkably higher than those of the executive directors of other
agencies. They called on the Agency to provide further explanation for this situation to the discharge authority in the framework of the
2012 discharge follow-up.
Prevention and management of conflicts of interests and transparency: they stated that the Agency will carry out an assessment to
identify its degree of exposure with a view to strengthening or supplementing its policy on the management and prevention of conflicts
of interests and with a view to assessing its implementation, monitoring and reporting during the first quarter of 2014 on the basis of
the Commission's Guidelines on the matter. They noted that the Agency has revised its policy for dealing with potential conflicts of
interest. Respective details are part of the obligations of the Agency's officials and other servants under the Staff Regulations and
Conditions for Employment. This information should be clearly presented on the Agency's website.
Lastly, Members also made a series of observations on transfers, procurement and recruitment procedures as well as comments on internal
controls.

2013/2212(DEC) - 03/04/2014 Final act
PURPOSE: to grant discharge to the European Environment Agency (EEA) for the financial year 2012.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision 2014/579/EU of the European Parliament on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of
the European Environment Agency for the financial year 2012.
CONTENT: with this Decision, the European Parliament gives discharge to the Executive Director of the European Environment Agency for
the implementation of the Agencys budget for 2012.
The Decision is in line with the European Parliaments resolution adopted on 3 April 2014 and includes a series of observations that form an
integral part of the discharge decision (refer to the summary of the opinion of 3 April 2014).
Amongst the main observations made, Parliament noted the problems regarding internal controls and noted that while the Agencys ex ante
verifications before reimbursement of costs claimed by beneficiaries consist of a desk analysis of cost claims, it does not usually obtain any
document from beneficiaries to substantiate the eligibility and accuracy of the staff costs claim. This issue should be resolved.

2013/2212(DEC) - 03/04/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a decision concerning the discharge to be granted to the Executive Director of the European Environment
Agency (EEA) in respect of the implementation of the Agency's budget for the financial year 2012. The vote on the discharge decision

year 2012 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Parliament adopted by 503 votes to 70, with 17 abstentions,
a resolution containing a series of recommendations that form an integral part of the discharge decision and as well as the general
recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies.
