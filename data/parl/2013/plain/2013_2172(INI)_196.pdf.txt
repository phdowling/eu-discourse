Commission response to text adopted in plenary

2013/2172(INI) - 30/01/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the own-initiative report by Michael THEURER (ALDE, DE) on the evaluation of the Unions
finances based on the results achieved: a new tool for the European Commissions improved discharge procedure. It pointed out that the
evaluation report introduced under Article 318 TFEU complemented the compliance approach developed by the Court of Auditors and gave
Parliament the opportunity to exercise more effectively its power of political scrutiny over the actions of the European public authorities.
However, it deplored the fact that instead of focusing on the achievement of the Unions main objectives, and the effectiveness of its policies,
the Commission had provided a range of evaluation summaries covering EU programmes in all policy areas of expenditure under the current
MFF, according to the current budget headings. Members recalled that the Court of Auditors had concluded that the second and third
evaluation reports did not yet provide evidence of what the EUs policies have achieved that was sufficient, relevant and reliable enough to be
used in the discharge procedure. The report urged the Commission to use specific information on the achievements of Member States in its
evaluation on the financial achievements of the Union.
A clear view of the real extent to which the Unions main objectives had been achieved should be provided by:
·

an evaluation of the main financial programmes and

·

a cross-cutting evaluation, by programme statements of operational expenditures, assessing to what extent the programmes have
contributed to achieving the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy.

The committee called on the Court to report to Parliament on the progress made by the Commission in designing and operating its risk
management, governance and internal control processes with a view to achieving the Unions objectives in a transparent and accountable
manner, and to formulate recommendations if any shortcomings were encountered.
Welcoming the fact that the Commission intended to structure and base its evaluation report on the new performance framework for the next
MFF, Members pointed out that such a performance framework should encompass three main elements: (i) achievement of the programme
objectives (results); (ii) sound programme management by the Commission and the Member States, and (iii) how programme results and
sound management contribute to the Unions main objectives.
Lastly, Members insisted on the need to aggregate the data yielded by the evaluation process at global level and, as regards internal policies,
in relation to Europe 2020 objectives.

2013/2172(INI) - 26/02/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a resolution on the evaluation of the Union?s finances based on the results achieved: a new tool for the
European Commission?s improved discharge procedure. It pointed out that the evaluation report introduced under Article 318 TFEU
complemented the compliance approach developed by the Court of Auditors and gave Parliament the opportunity to exercise more effectively
its power of political scrutiny over the actions of the European public authorities. Whilst welcoming the fact that in its last report, the
Commission took on board several recommendations made by Parliament in its decisions to grant discharge, Parliament deplored the fact that
instead of focusing on the achievement of the Union?s main objectives, and the effectiveness of its policies, the Commission had provided a
range of evaluation summaries covering EU programmes in all policy areas of expenditure under the current MFF, according to the current
budget headings. Members recalled that the Court of Auditors had concluded that the second and third evaluation reports did not yet provide
evidence of what the EU?s policies have achieved that was sufficient, relevant and reliable enough to be used in the discharge procedure. The
resolution urged the Commission to use specific information on the achievements of Member States in its evaluation on the financial
achievements of the Union.
A clear view of the real extent to which the Union?s main objectives had been achieved should be provided by:
·
·

an evaluation of the main financial programmes and
a cross-cutting evaluation, by programme statements of operational expenditures, assessing to what extent the programmes have
contributed to achieving the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy.

Parliament called on the Court to report to Parliament on the progress made by the Commission in designing and operating its risk
management, governance and internal control processes with a view to achieving the Union?s objectives in a transparent and accountable
manner, and to formulate recommendations if any shortcomings were encountered.

Welcoming the fact that the Commission intended to structure and base its evaluation report on the new performance framework for the next
MFF, Members pointed out that such a performance framework should encompass three main elements: (i) achievement of the programme
objectives (results); (ii) sound programme management by the Commission and the Member States, and (iii) how programme results and
sound management contribute to the Union?s main objectives.
Parliament insisted on the need to aggregate the data yielded by the evaluation process at global level and, as regards internal policies, in
relation to Europe 2020 objectives. It called on the Commission to submit the evaluation report on the Union?s finances, before 30 June of the
year following the financial year which is the subject of the evaluation.
