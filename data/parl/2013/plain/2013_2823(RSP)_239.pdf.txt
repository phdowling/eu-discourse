Summary

The European Parliament adopted a resolution on the Central African Republic.
The resolution was tabled by the ECR, EPP, ALDE, GUE/NGL, Greens/EFA and S&D groups.
It condemns the unconstitutional seizure of power, by dint of armed force, by the Séléka coalition on 24 March 2013, and expresses concern
about the complete breakdown of law and order and the absence of the rule of law in the CAR. It also condemn the serious violations of
humanitarian law and the widespread violations of human rights law, notably by elements of the Séléka, including torture, sexual and
gender-based violence and calls on the CAR authorities to take concrete measures to protect the civilian population, to end the recruitment of
children by armed groups, and to restore security and public order as well as basic electricity and water services.
Parliament welcomes the EU's increased support for addressing the humanitarian crisis in the CAR on 8 July by EUR 8 million, to EUR
20 million, but notes that this EU aid cannot be enough and other international partners must also enter into commitments. It calls for the EU
and its Member States to enhance their coordination with the other donors and international institutions in order to meet the urgent
humanitarian needs adequately and requests that an international meeting on the CAR be held on the margins of the UN General Assembly in
New York in September 2013. The UN Security Council is asked to study, as a matter of urgency, the request for support made by the African
Union to finance the 3 600 members of civil and military personnel of the peacekeeping mission in the CAR. Stakeholders and the Car are
urged to work together to implement the Libreville Agreement of 11 January 2013, which sets out the conditions for transition in the country
and for a return to constitutional order.
Recalling that, despite the fact that it is a country rich in natural resources (timber, gold, diamonds, uranium), the CAR ranks only 179th out of
187 countries on the UN Human Development Index, Members insist that a comprehensive political solution, including fair distribution of
revenue through the state budget, is vital for finding solutions to the crisis and paving the way for sustainable development of the region. They
call on the UN Secretary-General to appoint a panel of experts to carry out an inquiry into the exploitation of the CAR's agricultural and mineral
resources, with the objective of establishing a legal framework enabling the country's resources to benefit its population.
Lastly, Parliament calls for more international efforts for arresting members of the Lord's Resistance Army, for the perpetrators of human rights
violations, to be prosecuted in accordance with the obligations laid down in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which has
been signed by the CAR.
