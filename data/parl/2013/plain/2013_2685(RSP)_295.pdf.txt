Summary

The European Parliament adopted a resolution tabled on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs stating its concern that
the Commission has not to date adopted a new European strategy on health and safety at work and reiterating its call on the Commission to
present the new European strategy for the years between now and 2020, and to do so before the end of 2013. It notes that the Community
strategy 2007-2012 on health and safety at work expired in 2012 and has not yet been followed up by any policy document at EU level, and
also notes that the Commission admits that that Community strategy had a positive impact across the EU.
Members repeat the messages contained in Parliaments resolution of 15 December 2011 on the mid-term review of the European strategy
2007-2012 on health and safety at work. They deplore the fact that, to date, the Commission has not launched a proposal for a directive on
either work-related musculoskeletal disorders or the review of Directive 2004/37/EC on the protection of workers from the risks related to
exposure to carcinogens or mutagens at work, although these were already announced in its work programme for 2011.
