2013/2221(DEC) - 10/09/2013 Court of Auditors: opinion, report

PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the e European Centre for Disease Prevention and
Control (ECDC) for the year 2012, together with the Centres reply.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit concerned, amongst others, the annual accounts of the e European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.
In the Courts opinion, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control s Annual Accounts fairly present, in all material respects, its
financial position as of 31 December 2012 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the
provisions of its Financial Regulation and the accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
The Court also considers that the transactions underlying the annual accounts of the Centre for the financial year ended 31 December 2012
are, in all material respects, legal and regular.
The report confirms that the Centres 2012 budget amounted to EUR 58.2 million.
The report also makes a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of the Centre, accompanied by the latters
response. The main observations may be summarised as follows:
The Courts observations:
·

legality and regularity of transactions: the opinion on the legality and regularity of the Centres transactions was qualified for the year
2011 because the Centre did not respect the maximum amount of a framework contract from 2009. The Centre has taken corrective
action in 2012 and signed a replacement framework contract in June 2012 (no further payments will be made under the old contract)
and has improved monitoring the consumption of framework contracts in general. The 2012 payments amounting to EUR 5.2 million
stem from failures in previous years when the ceiling of the framework contract was not respected. Given the corrective action taken
by the Centre in 2012, the Court has not qualified the opinion on the legality and regularity of transactions this year;

·

internal controls: in order to strengthen controls, the Centre has adopted an ex post verification strategy and planned for its
implementation in 2012. However, it experienced a delay in gaining access to an interinstitutional audit contract and, at the time of
the audit, no ex post verifications of 2012 grant expenditure had yet taken place.

The Centres reply:
·

audits: the Centre has put all necessary measures in place: immediate launch of a new tender to establish a new Framework
Contract and a registration of exception. The Centre emphasises that no funds were lost and no parties have been disadvantaged.
The ECDC Grant Verification Policy is due to be revised in July 2013.

Lastly, the Court of Auditors report contains a summary of the Centres activities in 2012. This is focused on the following:
·

health threats identified and monitored using the Threat Tracking Tool (TTT) and weekly threat reports on communicable diseases ;

·

provision of support to epidemic intelligence for large mass-gathering events ;

·

preparation of risk assessments, and rapid risk assessment updates ;

·

simulation exercise workshops conducted for testing and improving preparedness and response to communicable diseases ;

·

coaching in the European Programme for Intervention Epidemiology Training (EPIET), and in the European Public Health
Microbiology Training (EUPHEM) ;

·

short training modules for public health experts from 30 EU-EEA countries ;

·

maintenance of the Centres web portal ;

·

publication of 240 scientific documents ;

·

organisation of Fifth European Antibiotic Awareness Day with the participation of 43 countries;

·

Organisation of the first Eurovaccine.net conference with 200 participants.

Eurosurveillance received its first impact factor. A stunning 6.15 was awarded for the year 2011. This places Eurosurveillance at rank 6 among
the 70 journals in the category Infectious Diseases, worldwide.

2013/2221(DEC) - 21/03/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Petri SARVAMAA (EPP, FI) in which it recommended the European Parliament to
grant discharge to the Director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) in respect of the implementation of the
Centre's budget for the financial year 2012.
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the Centre for the financial
year 2012 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Members approved the closure of ECDCs accounts. They
made, however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is granted, in addition to the general
recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies.
Budget and financial management: Members noted that budget monitoring efforts during the financial year 2012 resulted in a budget
implementation rate of 93.91% and that the payment appropriations execution rate was 76.26%. They noted that the Centre awarded
grants to research institutions and individuals and that the total grant expenditure amounted to EUR 752 000, representing 1.4% of the

2012 operating expenditure. Members were concerned that the Centre does not usually obtain any documents to substantiate the
eligibility and accuracy of the costs claimed by beneficiaries. They also noted that while the Centre has adopted an ex post verification
strategy and has planned for its implementation in 2012, no ex post verifications of 2012 grant expenditure have yet taken place.
Commitments and carryovers: Members noted that the Court of Auditors' annual audit has found that the level of carry-overs related to
operation expenditure is high whilst acknowledging that these carryovers reflect the multiannual nature of activities.
Members also made a series of observations on transfers, procurement and recruitment procedures as well as comments on internal controls.
Lastly, they also acknowledged that a revised version of the Centre's comprehensive independence policy is to be adopted by the Centre's
Management Board in 2014.

2013/2221(DEC) - 03/04/2014 Final act
PURPOSE: to grant discharge to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) for the financial year 2012.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision 2014/575/EU of the European Parliament on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of
the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) for the financial year 2012.
CONTENT: with the present decision, the European Parliament grants discharge to the Director of the Centre in respect of the implementation
of its budget for the financial year 2012.
This decision is in line with the European Parliament's resolution adopted on 3 April 2014 and comprises a series of observations that form an
integral part of the discharge decision (please refer to the summary of the opinion of 3 April 2014).
Amongst the main observations made, Parliament is concerned that the Centre does not usually obtain any documents to substantiate the
eligibility and accuracy of the costs claimed by beneficiaries. It called therefore on the Centre to improve this situation.
