2013/0087(COD) - 25/03/2013 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to apply the financial discipline adjustment rate to amounts in excess of EUR 5000, to be granted to farmers for aid applications
lodged in calendar year 2013.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: the first estimates of budget appropriations for direct payments and market related expenditure for the 2014 draft budget
showed the need to reduce the total amount of direct payments that can be granted to farmers in respect of calendar year 2013 by EUR 1
471.4 million through financial discipline, in order to respect the EAGF net ceiling for financial year 2014 and establish the reserve for crises in
the agricultural sector (EUR 424.5 million). As a consequence, the level of direct payments should be reduced in order to comply with the
ceiling.
On this basis, the Commission presents a proposal for setting the adjustment rate for direct payments in respect of calendar year 2013, which
must be adopted by the European Parliament and the Council by 30 June 2013 in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 73/2009.
However, if this adjustment rate has not been set by 30 June 2013, the Commission will set that rate pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No
1290/2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy.
IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the proposal implements the rules provided for in Article 11 of Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 and Article 18 of
Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005. Prior consultation with the interested parties and the preparation of an impact assessment were not
needed.
LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
CONTENT : the draft regulation provides that the amounts of direct payments within the meaning of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 to be granted
to a farmer in excess of EUR 5000 for an aid application submitted in respect of calendar year 2013 shall be reduced by 4.981759 %.
The reduction provided for shall not apply in Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia.
The unequal distribution of direct payments between small and large beneficiaries remains a cause for concern for the Common Agricultural

Policy. The draft regulation proposes to apply the financial discipline adjustment rate to amounts in excess of EUR 5000 in order to contribute
to achieving the objective of a more balanced distribution of payments. This is in line with what is proposed on financial discipline in the
context of the CAP reform, presented by the Commission in its proposal for a regulation establishing rules for direct payments to farmers under
support schemes within the framework of the common agricultural policy.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the financial discipline adjustment rate of 4.981759 % has been calculated taking into account that it is to be
applied only to amounts in excess of EUR 5000 and not in all Member States. The application of this adjustment rate will result in the reduction
of the amounts of direct payments for budget lines covering expenditure relating to aid applications submitted by farmers in respect of calendar
year 2013 (financial year 2014). The total reduction resulting from the application of financial discipline amounts to EUR 1471.4 million.
The adjustment rate has been calculated taking into account the estimated share of direct payments to be granted to farmers below EUR 5000
for each direct payment scheme subject to financial discipline and for each Member State, except Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia. Since direct
payments in Bulgaria, Romania and in Croatia, subject to accession, are in the process of phasing-in in calendar year 2013, the financial
discipline will not apply to them as a consequence.
It should be noted that the final calculation of the financial discipline rate will depend on the sub-ceiling under Heading 2 set by the Council
Regulation laying down the multiannual financial framework for the years 2014-2020 and the Interinstitutional Agreement between the
European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management.

2013/0087(COD) - 03/06/2013 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development adopted the report by Luis Manuel CAPOULAS SANTOS (S&D, PT) on the proposal for
a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on fixing an adjustment rate to direct payments provided for in Regulation (EC) No
73/2009 in respect of calendar year 2013.
The parliamentary committee recommends that the European Parliaments position adopted at first reading according to the ordinary legislative
procedure should amend the Commissions proposal.
The report notes that pending the adoption of a regulation laying down the multiannual financial framework, the level of the applicable ceiling
for the year 2014 remains uncertain. Until there is clarity on the level of the applicable ceiling, it is not possible to determine whether an
adjustment of the direct payments for 2013 is necessary and, if so, what the rate should be.
Given the context, Members consider that Parliament should not accept a cut in direct payments which is based on the Conclusions of the 7-8
February European Council, including its proposal of placing the crises reserve under Heading 2.
At present, the cut to direct payments should be based on the ceiling for 2014 proposed by the Commission in its own MFF proposal, which is
consistent with the European Parliament's negotiating mandate, approved in plenary on 13 March 2013, on the Direct Payments Regulation.
This is why the committee is tabling an amendment where the cut to direct payments for claims made in 2013 would amount to 0.748005%,
rather than the 4.981759% put forward by the Commission.
In the event of a non-agreement on the multiannual financial framework 2014-2020, no financial discipline for the 2014 financial year shall
apply, since the total amount shall be calculated on the basis of the 2013 budget figures plus 2% inflation.

2013/0087(COD) - 12/06/2013 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 506 votes to 147, with 28 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a Regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council on fixing an adjustment rate to direct payments provided for in Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 in respect
of calendar year 2013.
The European Parliaments position adopted at first reading under the ordinary legislative procedure amends the Commissions proposal.
In its amendments, Parliament recalls that pending the adoption of a regulation laying down the multiannual financial framework (MFF), the
level of the applicable ceiling for the year 2014 remains uncertain. Until there is clarity on the level of the applicable ceiling, it is not possible to
determine whether an adjustment of the direct payments for 2013 is necessary and, if so, what the rate should be.
In this context, Parliament suggests an amendment that would bring the cut to direct payments to 0.748005%, rather than the 4.981759% put
forward in the Commissions proposal. This reduction shall not apply to the outermost regions or to the smaller Aegean islands, as defined in
Regulation (EC) No 229/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council.
Members add that in the event of non-agreement on the multiannual financial framework 2014-2020, no financial discipline for the 2014
financial year shall apply, since the total amount will be calculated on the basis of the 2013 budget figures, plus 2% inflation.
Parliament considers that the amount of financial discipline required should be revised by the budgetary authority in the framework of the
adoption of the Budget 2014 on the basis, inter alia, of the Amending letter to the Draft General Budget 2014 by which the Commission
provides updated estimated needs on market related expenditures and direct payments.
