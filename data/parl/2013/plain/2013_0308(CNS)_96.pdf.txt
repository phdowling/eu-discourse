PURPOSE: to enable Croatia to accede to the Convention of 23 July 1990 on the elimination of double taxation in connection with the
adjustment of profits of associated enterprises
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
BACKGROUND: according to Article 3(5) of the Act of Accession the Council, acting unanimously on a recommendation by the Commission
and after consulting the European Parliament, shall decide to make all adjustments required by reason of the accession of Croatia to these
conventions and protocols and to publish the adapted texts in the Official Journal of the European Union.
The list of conventions and protocols include :
Convention 90/436/EEC of 23 July 1990 on the elimination of double taxation in connection with the adjustment of profits of associated
enterprises (Arbitration Convention),
the Convention of 21 December 1995 on the accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden to the Arbitration Convention,
the Protocol of 25 May 1999 amending the Arbitration Convention,
the Convention of 8 December 2004 on the accession of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland,
Slovenia and Slovakia to the Arbitration Convention.
The Arbitration Convention was amended by the Protocol of 25 May 1999 and the Conventions of 21 December 1995 and of 8 December
2004.
Bulgaria and Romania acceded to the Arbitration Convention by virtue of the Act of Accession of 2005. Decision 2008/492/EC made the
adjustments required by reason of the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the Arbitration Convention and determined the date of its entry
into force, as amended, with relation to Bulgaria and Romania.
CONTENT: this proposed Commission Recommendation for a Council Decision is intended to make the adjustments required by reason of the
accession of Croatia to the Arbitration Convention and to determine the date of its entry into force, as amended, with relation to Croatia, in
accordance with the Act of Accession of 2011.

2013/0308(CNS) - 21/03/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs unanimously adopted, in the framework of a special legislative procedure (Parliament
consultation), the report by S?awomir NITRAS (EPP, PL) on the recommendation for a Council decision concerning the accession of Croatia
to the Convention of 23 July 1990 on the elimination of double taxation in connection with the adjustment of profits of associated enterprises.
Members called on the Council, when deciding on the date of application of the Convention of 23 July 1990 on the elimination of double
taxation in connection with the adjustment of profits of associated enterprises, to take into account Parliament's concerns regarding the need
to minimise the tax burden on tax payers.
Members made one amendment as regards the date of entry into force of the amending Arbitrage Convention. The proposed text suggested
that the date of entry into force should be specified in this Decision.
Taking into account the experience with the previous decisions amending The Arbitration Convention and in order to remove any doubts

regarding the possible retroactive effect, Members proposed that the date of entry into force of the Arbitration Convention be set on the day
following that of the publication of this Decision in the Official Journal of the European Union.

2013/0308(CNS) - 15/04/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 649 votes to 4, with 21 abstentions, in the framework of a special legislative procedure (consultation), a
legislative resolution on the recommendation for a Council decision concerning the accession of Croatia to the Convention of 23 July 1990 on
the elimination of double taxation in connection with the adjustment of profits of associated enterprises.
Parliament approved the Commission recommendation with one amendment stipulating that that the date of entry into force of the Arbitration
Convention, as amended, as well as the decision should be the day following that of the publication of this Decision in the Official Journal of
the European Union.
The resolution called on the Council, when deciding on the date of application of the Convention of 23 July 1990 on the elimination of double
taxation in connection with the adjustment of profits of associated enterprises, to take into account Parliament's concerns regarding the need
to minimise the tax burden on tax payers.
