2013/2248(DEC) - 26/07/2013 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: presentation by the Commission of the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2012, as part of
the 2012 discharge procedure.
Analysis of the accounts of the SESAR Joint Undertaking.
CONTENT: this Commission document sets out the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2012 as
prepared on the basis of the information presented by the institutions, organisations and bodies of the EU, in accordance with Article 129 (2) of
the Financial Regulation applicable to the EU's General Budget, including the SESAR Joint Undertaking.
In 2012, the tasks and budget of the Joint Undertaking were as follows:
description of the tasks of the Joint Undertaking: SESAR Joint Undertaking, located in Brussels, was set up in 2007 by Regulation
(EC) 219/2007 for a period extending to 31 December 2017. The aim of this Joint Undertaking is to ensure the modernisation of the
European air traffic management system and the rapid implementation of the European air traffic management Master Plan by
coordinating and concentrating all relevant research and development efforts in the EU
budget of the Joint Undertaking for the 2012 financial year: the budget for SESAR's development phase (2008-2013) is provided in
equal parts by the EU, by Eurocontrol and by public and private partners. At 31 December 2012, the Commission held 46.12 % of the
ownership participation in SESAR. The total (indicative) Commission contribution foreseen for SESAR (from 2007 to 2013) is EUR 700
million. The cumulative unrecognised share of losses is EUR 157 million.
Please also consult SESAR Joint Undertakings final accounts.

2013/2248(DEC) - 22/10/2013 Court of Auditors: opinion, report
PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the SESAR Joint Undertaking, together with the Joint
Undertakings replies.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.

This audit concerned, amongst others, the annual accounts of the SESAR Joint Undertaking.
In the Courts opinion, the SESAR Joint Undertakings Annual Accounts fairly present, in all material respects, its financial position as of 31
December 2012 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions of its financial
rules and the accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
It also considers that the transactions underlying the annual accounts of the Authority for the financial year ended 31 December 2012 are, in all
material respects, legal and regular.
The report confirms that the SESAR Joint Undertakings 2012 budget amounted to EUR 156 564 786 in commitments and EUR 124 198 884 in
payments.
The report also makes a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of the Joint Undertaking, accompanied by the
latters response. The main observations may be summarised as follows:
Courts comments: the Court notes that improvements are required in the following ex ante control areas: (i) improvements could be made to
the documentation of controls on the monitoring of project deliverables, project performance analysis, subcontractor monitoring and cost claim
certificates; (ii) a technical review report produced by external experts at an airborne equipment manufacturer in relation to projects carried out
by it for the SESAR and Clean Sky Joint Undertakings concluded that improvements could be made to the exchange of data and results
between the two Joint Undertakings.
Joint Undertakings replies: SESAR states that it is committed towards the improvement of its system and procedures allocating the resources
available to enhance its risk management, controls and governance processes to ensure the achievement of the SESAR programme
objectives.
On an operational level, the Courts report stated that at 31 December 2012, the SESAR Joint Undertaking development phase consisted of
work by 16 members on programme activities involving more than 100 private and public entities and subcontractors. Of the 336 projects
selected, 312 (92.8%) were being implemented.
As regards the activities of the Joint Undertaking in 2012, the report refers to the Annual Activity Report 2012 which can be found at
http://www.sesarju.eu/.

2013/2248(DEC) - 20/03/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Paul RÜBIG (EPP, AT) on discharge in respect of the implementation of the
budget of the SESAR Joint Undertaking for the financial year 2012 and called on the European Parliament to grant the Executive Director of
the SESAR Joint Undertaking discharge in respect of the implementation of the Office's budget for the financial year 2012.
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the FCH JU for the financial
year 2012 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Members made a number of recommendations that need to
be taken into account when the discharge is granted, in addition to the general recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on
performance, financial management and control of EU agencies:
·

Budget and financial management: Members noted that the Joint Undertaking's final budget for the financial year 2012 included
commitment appropriations of EUR 156.6 million and payment appropriations of EUR 124.2 million

·

Utilisation rate and carryovers: the committee noted, furthermore, that the utilisation rates for commitment and payment
appropriations were 95 % and 86 % respectively. It pointed out that at year-end, cash and cash equivalents amounted to EUR 15.7
million which was at odds with the budgetary principle of equilibrium. It reminded the Joint Undertaking of the need to implement
concrete measures to attain budget equilibrium.

·

SESAR programme objectives: Members reiterated their call on the Joint Undertaking to inform the discharge authority about the
stage of implementation of more than 310 research and development and management projects under the SESAR programme and
to present the results achieved. They stated again that the Joint Undertaking should use all the financial resources made available to
it to complete the development of the technology and operational improvements necessary for the deployment of SESAR on time.
Members notes Parliaments previous recommendation that any potential conflicts of interest should not be dismissed but addressed
properly.

Members made a series of observations on in-kind contributions, internal controls and internal audits and horizontal aspects of European
Research Joint Undertakings. They invited the Court of Auditors to monitor the Joint Undertaking's policies as regards the management and
prevention of conflicts of interests by drafting a Special Report on the matter by the next discharge procedure.
JTI: the committee invited the Court of Auditors to comprehensively analyse the Joint Technology Initiatives (JTIs) and the other joint
undertakings in a separate report in light of the substantial amounts involved and the risks- notably reputational presented. It noted that the
Joint Undertakings total 2012 forecasted budgeted income amounted to some EUR 2.5 billion or about 1.8 % of the 2012 Union general
budget while approximately EUR 618 million came from the general budget (cash contribution from the Commission) and approximately EUR
134 million came from the industrial partners and members of the Joint Undertakings.
Members recalled that Parliament had previously requested that the Court of Auditors draw up a special report on the capacity of the joint
undertakings, together with their private partners, to ensure added value and efficient execution of Union research, technological development
and demonstration programmes.
They agreed with the Court of Auditors conclusion that the JTIs had been set up to support long-term industrial investment in particular
research areas, but noted that it had taken on average two years to grant financial autonomy to a JTI, with the Commission usually remaining
responsible for one third of the expected operational lifetime of the JTIs.

2013/2248(DEC) - 03/04/2014 Final act

PURPOSE: to grant discharge to the SESAR Joint Undertaking for the financial year 2012.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision 2014/633/EU of the European Parliament on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of
the SESAR Joint Undertaking for the financial year 2012.
CONTENT: with the present decision, the European Parliament grants discharge to the Executive Director of the SESAR Joint Undertaking in
respect of its budget for the financial year 2012.
This decision is in line with the European Parliament's resolution adopted on 3 April 2014 and comprises a series of observations that form an
integral part of the discharge decision (please refer to the summary of the opinion of 3 April 2014).
Amongst the main observations made, Parliament made a number of cross-cutting comments as regards all the Joint Undertakings (JUs) and
invited the Court of Auditors to conduct a detailed analysis of the JUs in a separate report in light of the substantial amounts involved and the
risks - notably reputational - presented.

2013/2248(DEC) - 03/04/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a decision concerning the discharge to be granted to the Executive Director of the SESAR Joint
Undertaking in respect of the implementation of the Joint Undertaking's budget for the financial year 2012. The vote on the discharge decision
covered the closure of the accounts (in accordance with Annex VI, Article 5(1) of Parliaments Rules of Procedure).

financial position as of 31 December 2012 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, Parliament adopted by
474 votes to 58, with 19 abstentions, a resolution containing a series of recommendations that need to be taken into account when the
discharge is granted, in addition to the general recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management
and control of EU agencies.
