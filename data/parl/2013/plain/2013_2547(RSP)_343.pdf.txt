Summary

The European Parliament adopted a resolution tabled on behalf of the Committee on International Trade on the increase in Norwegian duties
on agricultural products.
It deplores the recent measures imposed by the Norwegian Government, which it regards as protectionist and prohibitive to trade, and as
clearly breaching the letter and the spirit of the Bilateral Agreement between the EU and Norway concerning additional trade preferences in
agricultural products. It urges the Norwegian Government and Parliament to withdraw the measures. Members refer to the fact that since 1
January 2013 European exporters of certain cheeses and of lamb and beef meat have faced ad valorem duties of 277 %, 429 % and 344 %,
respectively, in the Norwegian market, and that this measure was preceded by the imposition of a new 72 % import duty on hydrangea
(hortensia) flowers. They stress that the Norwegian Government proposed these measures without prior consultation with its EU counterparts.
Furthermore, Parliament questions the economic logic behind these measures, which could have trade-reducing effects, harming all the
parties involved and especially Norwegian consumers, and in the long run Norwegian farmers as well. The Commission is asked to assess the
potential negative effects of the increased tariffs on EU exporters and farmers.
Parliament calls on the Commission to continue negotiations with the Norwegian authorities in order to work for a mutually satisfactory solution
and to take into consideration the possibility of proposing further action in the event of a lack of cooperation , with the aim of having the
measures withdrawn. The Commission is asked to specify the measures it intends to take in the eventuality that Norway refuses to reverse its
decision, in particular with a view to protecting jobs and output in the Union's agricultural sector, should the need arise.
