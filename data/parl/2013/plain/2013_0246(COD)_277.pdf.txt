Directive 2015/2302
OJ L 326 11.12.2015, p. 0001 Summary

2013/0246(COD) - 09/07/2013 Document attached to the procedure
By means of this Communication, the Commission seeks to respond to the numerous calls from the professionals in the sector, consumers
and legislators, for the rules in the EU Package Travel Directive (Council Directive 90/314/EEC) to be brought into the digital age.
Need for reform of the 1990 Directive: over the last 20 years, the travel market has been transformed, notably by the internet. In 2011, online
travel sales accounted for around 35 % of all travel bookings; in the sole month of March 2013, nearly 183 million citizens visited an on-line
travel website.

Now, although 23 % of EU travellers still purchase traditional, prearranged packages, more and more either buy different parts of their trips
separately (54 % of Europeans who took a holiday in 2011), or buy customised holidays which are put together by one or more commercially
linked traders to suit their needs and preferences. Such combined travel arrangements now account for 23% of the holiday market , roughly
118 million trips every year.
The advent of these new types of holidays has created ambiguities, because both businesses and consumers may be unsure whether they are
covered by the legislation. In practice, legal protection may differ, depending on how, where and by whom the arrangements are offered for
sale, even though the travel components may be identical.
In this new market environment, the current EU rules no longer meet the needs of consumers and businesses . The different legal
requirements across the Member States, e.g. on pre-contractual information, liability and insolvency protection, mean that businesses have
more difficulty expanding their operations across borders. Thus, travel businesses are no longer competing on an equal footing.
Moreover, the outdated scope of the Directive also means consumers can lose money when they buy travel products that are not covered
while believing that they are protected.
A new proposal to modernise the rules: the Commission considers that revising the Directive will, in line with the EU strategy for tourism, help
in strengthening European tourism by adjusting the existing rules to changed consumer behaviour, as announced by the European Consumer
Agenda and re-stated by the second EU Citizenship Report.
The proposal clarifies the existing Directive and brings it up to date with legal and market developments. It enhances consumer protection at a
reasonable cost to the industry while leaving businesses and consumers free to choose what they wish to sell and buy.
While still focusing on packages, the proposed legislation is wider in scope and clearly includes new, commonly used combined travel
arrangements. It also puts in place a flexible system for business travel.
Moreover, the proposal:
ensures greater market transparency by enabling all travellers to clearly identify whether they are being offered a package or not, thus
avoiding confusion;
repeals special rules on brochures (less necessary with the internet). However, the proposal ensures that the traveller will still receive
all the key information before signing a contract and that any potentially important news after that, for instance a change to the
itinerary, is communicated in writing (including email);
gives travellers new cancellation rights: consumers will have the right to cancel the contract before departure, albeit by paying the
organiser reasonable compensation for the costs incurred. In the event of natural disasters, warfare or similar serious events at
destination, consumers will also have the right to cancel the contract without paying compensation. Rules on prices will be fairer and
more predictable with the introduction of a 10 % cap on price increases;
provides clearer remedies and a better system of redress if something goes wrong. It also contractual liability. Travellers will still have
a single contact point if something goes wrong during the holiday, and organisers are made liable for the performance of the services
included;
clarifies the insolvency protection rule, and explicitly obliges Member States to ensure mutual recognition of national insolvency
protection schemes, within a structured cooperation mechanism.
The Commission considers that the new proposal is a proportionate response to new market developments while taking fully into account the
specific position of SMEs in their dual role as suppliers and users of travel services. Indeed, considering that an overwhelming majority (99 %)
of EU tour operators and travel agents are SMEs (of which 92 % are micro-enterprises), the proposal aims to reduce the average cost of
offering traditional packages, by modernising the rules and cutting red tape.
At the same time, the proposal leaves all off- and on-line traders free to offer their services to facilitate the arrangement of holidays involving
the combination of separate travel services, without becoming liable for the performance of the different services. However in the interest of
fair competition and in order to protect consumers, the obligation to provide sufficient evidence of security for the refund of pre-payments and
the repatriation of travellers in the area of insolvency should also apply to assisted travel arrangements.

2013/0246(COD) - 09/07/2013 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to enhance the functioning of the Internal Market and achieve a high level of consumer protection through the approximation of
Member States legislative, regulatory and administrative rules on packages and other combinations of travel services.
PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: tourism plays a central role in Europes economy today. With some 1.8 million businesses, mostly SMEs, employing 5.2% of
the total workforce, the European tourism industry is an engine for growth in the EU. The total contribution of European travel & tourism,
including related sectors, accounts for around 10% of EU GDP.
The travel market has evolved since the adoption of Directive 90/314/EEC. The Internet has become an increasingly important medium to offer
travel services. Travel services are not only combined in the form of traditional pre-arranged packages, but are often combined in a
customised fashion. Many of these travel products are either in a legal grey zone or are clearly not covered by Directive 90/314/EEC.
It is therefore necessary to adapt the legislative framework to market developments , remove ambiguities and close legislative gaps. The
modernisation of Directive 90/314/EEC responds to requests from the co-legislators and a large part of the industry and consumer
organisations. A revision of the Directive is explicitly mentioned in the European Citizens' Report, the European Consumer Agenda and in the
Single Market Act II.
IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Impact Assessment (IA) analysed eight policy options plus certain sub-options, including maintaining the status
quo, the drawing up of guidelines, the introduction of a package travel label, self-regulation by the industry, various options to modernise the

Directive, as well as the adoption of a Travel Directive.
The chosen option is that of a graduated approach involving the modernisation of the Directive and the coverage of both one trader and
multi-trader packages, while applying a lighter regime to multi-trader assisted travel arrangements.
LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
CONTENT: the proposed Directive seeks to clarify and modernise the scope of travellers' protection when purchasing combinations of travel
services for the same trip or holiday by bringing within its scope different forms of on-line packages and assisted travel arrangements.
The proposal will ensure that travellers are better informed about the services they are buying and grant them clearer remedies if something
goes wrong.
Package travel: the proposal:
·

lists specific pre-contractual information which organisers and, where applicable, retailers have to provide to travellers wishing to buy
a package;

·

contains provisions on the content and the presentation of the contract or its confirmation, as well as on documents and information
to be provided before the start of the package;

·

regulates the possibility and the consequence of price changes;

·

contains additional termination rights for travellers before the start of the package and grants travellers the right to terminate the
contract without compensation in the event of unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances;

·

regulates the organiser's liability for the performance of the package and the obligation to provide assistance to the traveller; only the
organiser is liable for the performance of the package; retailers involved in the booking of packages and assisted travel
arrangements are liable for booking errors;

·

provides for the remedies available to the traveller in the event of the lack of performance and the improper performance of the
services;

·

lays down the obligations to remedy the lack of conformity and to make suitable alternative arrangements for the continuation of the
package where a significant proportion of the services cannot be provided as agreed in the contract. Where it is impossible to ensure
the traveller's timely return because of unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances, the organiser's obligation to bear the cost for
the continued stay is limited to EUR 100 per night and three nights per traveller;

·

provides that only package organisers and retailers who facilitate the purchase of 'assisted travel arrangements' are subject to
theobligation to provide insolvency protection;

·

provides that travellers may address messages, complaints or claims also to the retailer.

Assisted travel arrangement: these are defined as a combination of at least two different types of travel services for the purpose of the same
trip or holiday, not constituting a package, resulting in the conclusion of separate contracts with the individual travel service providers.
Retailers offering assisted travel arrangements would have to explain to travellers in a clear and prominent manner that only the relevant
service providers are liable for performance of the services and that travellers will not benefit from any of the Union rights granted to package
travellers, except the right to a refund of pre-payments and, where relevant, to repatriation in case the retailer itself or any of the service
providers becomes insolvent.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the only operational costs relate to the preparation of the report on the application of this Directive, covering
the preparatory work of an external contractor, i.e. operational appropriation of EUR 0.2 million under the Rights and Citizenship programme,
as well as administrative expenditure of around EUR 0.184 million during seven years after the adoption of the Directive.

2013/0246(COD) - 18/02/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection adopted the report by Hans-Peter MAYER (EPP, DE) on the proposal for a
directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on package travel and assisted travel arrangements, amending Regulation (EC) No
2006/2004, Directive 2011/83/EU and repealing Council Directive 90/314/EEC.
The parliamentary committee recommended that the position of the European Parliament adopted at first reading under the ordinary legislative
procedure modify the Commission proposal as follows.
Scope: it is noted that the scope will not cover:
·

packages put together and made available by natural or legal persons which do not secure any financial gain, either directly or
indirectly, from this activity;

·

packages and linked travel arrangements purchased on the basis of a framework contract for business travel between a business on
whose behalf the traveller is travelling and a trader;

·

ancillary services provided as a subsidiary element of the package, to ensure that traders, in particular small local travel agencies,
do not unwittingly become package tour organisers simply by booking transport to the point of departure, for example a rail journey
to the airport of departure;

·

carriage of passengers by bus, rail, water or air which includes accommodation, if the main component is clearly transport and such
carriage is not combined with another travel service.

Pre-contractual information: only the organiser should be required to communicate pre-contractual information to the traveller. This information
should specify:

·

the travel destination(s), itinerary and periods of stay, with dates, and the number of nights included;

·

the official category of the accommodation assigned by the competent body in the place in which the accommodation is located;

·

the travel services provided to the traveller as a part of a group;

·

the total price must be presented in the form of a detailed invoice setting out all the costs of the travel service in a transparent
manner;

·

information on the optional conclusion of an insurance policy to cover the costs of cancellation by the traveller or the cost of
repatriation in the event of accident or illness;

·

information that the traveller or the organiser may terminate the contract at any time before the start of the package and upon the
payment of an applicable reasonable standardised termination fee.

Members deleted the requirement to communicate information on the language(s) in which the activities will be carried out. However,
information about the trips suitability for persons with reduced mobility should be provided on request.
Where a travel contract is concluded by electronic means, the organiser shall make the traveller aware in a clear and prominent manner, and
directly before the traveller places his order, of the information provided for. As regards compliance with the information requirements, the
burden of proof shall be on the trader.
Moreover, before the start of the package, the traveller should also receive: i) all relevant contact details in case the traveller perceives any
lack of conformity, and details of how the traveller should proceed; ii) the name, geographical address, telephone number and e-mail address
of a contact point whose assistance a traveller in difficulty could request.
Changes to the package, price reductions or price increases:
·

A price increase may be passed on only if it exceeds 3 % of the total cost of the package. Any price reduction which exceeds 3 % of
the total cost must be passed on. In the event of a price reduction, the organiser may charge an administrative fee of up to EUR 10
per traveller. Price changes must always be justified in writing.

·

As the legal consequence of a price increase of more than 8 % or of a permissible, significant change to the package travel contract,
in addition to the right of withdrawal with no financial penalty the traveller should also be given the option of taking up an equivalent
package. If a traveller fails to reply to the letter informing him or her of the changes to the package travel contract or the price
increase of more than 8 %, the package will be deemed to have been accepted at the increased price. The burden of proof in
respect of the provision of this information should lie with the organiser.

Withdrawal: travellers should be able at any time to withdraw from the contract against payment of appropriate compensation . The burden of
proof regarding the appropriateness of the compensation should lie with the organiser, since only he can outline what costs he has incurred, or
not incurred.
·

Should a package be significantly affected by unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances, such as warfare or a natural disaster,
the traveller should be able to withdraw without being required to pay compensation. This rule must not apply, however, if the
relevant circumstances prevailed prior to the booking of the package and the traveller was aware of them.

·

The traveller shall have the right to terminate the contract before the start of the package without compensation in the event of
unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances such as an accident or a serious illness, or death in the family , provided that these
incidents are appropriately documented.

No-fault liability: the organiser should bear some measure of liability if it is not possible to ensure the travellers timely return because of
unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances.
If the organiser arranges accommodation himself, he should bear the cost for up to five nights, with no ceiling applied. If the traveller is
required to book accommodation, however, the organiser may limit the cost of accommodation to EUR 125 per night per traveller. Insolvency
protection: Members considered that travellers must be protected against the insolvency of the organiser, the retailer or an undertaking
involved in providing the assisted travel arrangements. However, in the context of insolvency, the repatriation of travellers should not
necessarily take place immediately. Instead, a continuation of the trip should be offered if possible.

2013/0246(COD) - 12/03/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 654 votes to 19 with 9 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a directive of the
European Parliament and of the Council on package travel and assisted travel arrangements, amending Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004,
Directive 2011/83/EU and repealing Council Directive 90/314/EEC.
Parliaments position in first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure amended the Commission proposal as follows:
Level of harmonisation and scope: the purpose of the directive is the achievement of a high and as uniform as possible level of consumer
protection in respect of contracts on package travel and linked travel arrangements concluded between travellers and traders. Unless
otherwise provided for, Member States shall not maintain or introduce, in their national law, provisions diverging from those laid down in the
Directive.
Parliament stated that the scope will not cover:
·

packages put together and made available by natural or legal persons which do not secure any financial gain, either directly or
indirectly, from this activity;

·

packages and linked travel arrangements purchased on the basis of a framework contract for business travel between a business on
whose behalf the traveller is travelling and a trader;

·

ancillary services provided as a subsidiary element of the package, to ensure that traders, in particular small local travel agencies, do

not unwittingly become package tour organisers simply by booking transport to the point of departure, for example a rail journey to
the airport of departure;
·

carriage of passengers by bus, rail, water or air which includes accommodation, if the main component is clearly transport and such
carriage is not combined with another travel service.

Pre-contractual information: the organiser will be required to communicate the following pre-contractual information to the traveller:
·

the travel destination(s), itinerary and periods of stay, with dates, and the number of nights included;

·

the approximate time of departure and return, where the exact time is not yet determined;

·

the official category of the accommodation assigned by the competent body in the place in which the accommodation is located;

·

the travel services provided to the traveller as a part of a group;

·

the total price must be presented in the form of a detailed invoice setting out all the costs of the travel service in a transparent
manner;

·

information on the optional conclusion of an insurance policy to cover the costs of cancellation by the traveller or the cost of
repatriation in the event of accident or illness;

·

information that the traveller or the organiser may terminate the contract at any time before the start of the package and upon the
payment of an applicable reasonable standardised termination fee.

Members deleted the requirement to communicate information on the language(s) in which the activities will be carried out. However,
information about the trips suitability for persons with reduced mobility should be provided on request.
Where a travel contract is concluded by electronic means, the organiser shall make the traveller aware in a clear and prominent manner, and
directly before the traveller places his order, of the information provided for. As regards compliance with the information requirements, the
burden of proof shall be on the trader.
Moreover, before the start of the package, the traveller should also receive: i) necessary receipts, vouchers or tickets, including information on
the precise times of departure, intermediate stops, transport connections and arrival; ii) all relevant contact details in case the traveller
perceives any lack of conformity, and details of how the traveller should proceed; (iii) the name, geographical address, telephone number and
e-mail address of a contact point whose assistance a traveller in difficulty could request.
Changes to the package, price reductions or price increases:
·

Before the start of the package, the organiser may not unilaterally change significant contract terms other than the price. A change in
the terms of a contract shall in particular be considered to be significant if the time of departure and return provided diverges by more
than three hours from the actual time of departure or return or, if it is not within the part of the day indicated in the pre-contractual
information.

·

A price increase may be passed on only if it exceeds 3 % of the total cost of the package . Any price reduction which exceeds 3 % of
the total cost must be passed on. In the event of a price reduction, the organiser may charge an administrative fee of up to EUR 10
per traveller. Price changes must always be justified in writing.

As the legal consequence of a price increase of more than 8 % or of a permissible, significant change to the package travel contract, in
addition to the right of withdrawal with no financial penalty the traveller should also be given the option of taking up an equivalent package. If a
traveller fails to reply to the letter informing him or her of the changes to the package travel contract or the price increase of more than 8 %, the
package will be deemed to have been accepted at the increased price.
Termination: the Commission proposal states that the traveller may terminate the contract before the start of the package against payment of
an appropriate compensation to the organiser. In the absence of standardised termination fees, the amount of the compensation shall
correspond to the price of the package minus the expenses proved to have been saved by the organiser , which cannot be recovered, from the
travel service providers or through alternative deployment of those services. Fees due for the termination of the contract, including
administrative fees, shall not be disproportionate or excessive. The organiser shall provide a justification for the calculation of the amount of
the compensation or the standardised termination fees. The burden of proof that the compensation is appropriate shall be on the organiser.
Once the travel contract has been concluded, the traveller shall have the right to terminate the contract before the start of the package without
compensation in the event of unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances such as war or natural disaster. This does not apply if the traveller
was already aware of the circumstances at the time of reservation.
Services included in the price: if any of the services are not performed in accordance with the contract, the organiser shall remedy the lack of
conformity, provided the lack of conformity is reported by the traveller or is clear to the organiser and remedying it would not
be disproportionate, unless the lack of conformity is attributable to the traveller.
Where a significant proportion of the services cannot be provided as agreed in the contract, the organiser shall make suitable alternative
arrangements, at no extra cost to the traveller, for the continuation of the package, with service quality at least equivalent to that specified
under the contract.
If it is impossible for the organiser to offer suitable alternative arrangements and the services agreed in the contract have not been
provided, the traveller must be compensated within 14 days.
No-fault liability: the organiser should bear some measure of liability if it is not possible to ensure the travellers timely return because of
unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances.
If the organiser arranges accommodation himself, he should bear the cost for up to five nights, with no ceiling applied. If the traveller is
required to book accommodation, however, the organiser may limit the cost of accommodation to EUR 125 per night per traveller.
Insolvency protection: travellers must be protected against the insolvency of the organiser, the retailer or an undertaking involved in providing
the assisted travel arrangements. However, in the context of insolvency, the repatriation of travellers should not necessarily take place
immediately. Instead, a continuation of the trip should be offered if possible.

Formal requirements for contracts: Member States shall ensure that all contracts covered by this Directive are in plain and intelligible language
and, insofar as they are in writing, legible. The language of the contract shall be the same as that of the pre-contractual information.

2013/0246(COD) - 22/09/2015 Council position
The main elements of the Council position at first reading may be summarised as follows:
Subject matter: the purpose of this Directive is to contribute to the proper functioning of the internal market and to the achievement of a high
and as uniform as possible level of consumer protection by approximating certain aspects of the laws, regulations and administrative
provisions of the Member States in respect of contracts between travellers and traders relating to package travel and linked travel
arrangements.
This Directive applies to packages offered for sale or sold by traders to travellers and to linked travel arrangements facilitated by traders for
travellers.
Level of harmonisation: Member States shall not maintain or introduce, in their national law, provisions diverging from those laid down in this
Directive, including more or less stringent provisions which would ensure a different level of traveller protection.
Definition of a package: the Council agreed to keep the so-called 'click-throughs' included under the definition of a package. A 'click-through'
occurs, when at least two different types of travel services are purchased from separate traders through linked online booking processes and
when the traveller's name, e-mail address and payment details are transmitted between traders within a 24-hour limit.
Moreover, a review clause was added so that the Commission, three years after the entry into force of the Directive, has to assess the
effectiveness of this provision, in particular the definition of 'click-throughs', and may come up with a legislative proposal.
Linked travel arrangements LTAs: the definition of linked travel arrangements (LTAs), initially called assisted travel arrangements, has been
further developed by specifying that the different travel services have to be selected and paid separately by the traveller. Moreover it is
specified that the trader has to facilitate the purchase of additional travel services in a targeted manner from another trader and the
consequent contract with such other trader has to be concluded not more than 24 hours after the confirmation of the purchase of the first travel
service.
Furthermore, before concluding a contract leading to an LTA, the trader has to inform the traveller, by using standard forms, that he will not
benefit from the rights granted by this Directive except for insolvency protection.
Definition of a package - combinations forming a package: the Council clarified that: (i) when an additional travel service is booked and does
not account for 25% or more of the value of the combination of the travel services and does not constitute an essential feature of the trip, or:
(ii) an additional travel service is selected and purchased only after the performance of a first travel service , this should not fall under the
definition of a package.
Insolvency protection: the Council position stipulated that insolvency protection should provide for adequate coverage in all likely
circumstances and reflect the level of financial risk represented by the traders activities, but that this liability should not be open-ended.
An insolvency protection schemes liability should extend only to circumstances which reflect the normal assessment of risk.
The special situation of smaller companies when laying down rules on the insolvency protection to be provided by traders in relation to
packages and LTAs should be taken into account.
Pre-contractual information: the information should include the following:
the main characteristics of the travel services;
the trading name and geographical address of the organiser and, where applicable, of the retailer, as well as their telephone number
and, where applicable, e-mail address;
the total price of the package inclusive of taxes and, where applicable, of all additional fees, charges and other costs;
the arrangements for payment, including any amount or percentage of the price which is to be paid as a down payment and the
timetable for payment of the balance;
general information on passport and visa requirements, including approximate periods for obtaining visas and information on health
formalities, of the country of destination;
information that the traveller may terminate the contract at any time before the start of the package in return for payment of an
appropriate termination fee;
information on optional or compulsory insurance to cover the cost of termination of the contract by the traveller or the cost of
assistance, including repatriation, in the event of accident, illness or death.
Accommodation in the event of unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances: the text specifies that accommodation in an equivalent category
(if possible) is limited to a maximum number of 3 nights unless Union legislation provides otherwise.
Alteration of significant contract terms: in the event of alteration of significant contract terms the organiser must inform the traveller of the
reasonable time limit within which the traveller has to inform the organiser of his decision, including the option to terminate the contract.
Compensation for non-material damage: the Council confirmed the traveller's entitlement to compensation for any damage. This also includes
compensation for non-material damage
Exclusion of occasional and not-for-profit packages and linked travel arrangements: the Council decided to exclude occasional and
not-for-profit packages and LTAs from the scope of this Directive given that there is less need to protect travellers in such cases. However, in
order to enable travellers to make informed choices, adequate information that such arrangements are not covered by this Directive should be
publicly available.
Business travel: the text generally excludes business trips since such business trips already enjoy a comparative level of protection in relation
to holiday packages.

Car rental: rental of 'motorcycles requiring a Category A driving licence under Directive 2006/126/EC' is included on a par with 'car rental'. This
category of motorcycles is reserved for larger motorbikes with no limit to the engine size or power.
Contracts concluded by telephone: the Council streamlined the information requirements for contracts concluded by distance communication,
including phone, by applying Article 8(6) of the Consumer Rights Directive.
Annexes I and II: the Council has added two Annexes which explain in plain language and in a standardised way the rights and obligations of
travellers and traders in relation to packages and LTAs.

2013/0246(COD) - 05/10/2015 Commission communication on Council's position
The Commission accepted the Council's position at first reading which reflects the political agreement reached between the European
Parliament and the Council in informal trilogies on 5 May 2015, subsequently endorsed by the Competitiveness Council on 28 May 2015.
The Commission supports this agreement since it is in keeping with the objectives of the Commission proposal. The main elements of the
agreement are as follows:
the agreement maintains the differentiated approach regarding packages and linked travel arrangements (called 'assisted travel
arrangement' in the Commission proposal): it preserves the substance of the definition of packages and the associated protection
level, while making certain adjustments regarding the definition of linked travel arrangements and the insolvency protection granted to
travellers purchasing such arrangements. At the same time, it further strengthens the transparency for travellers by adding compulsory
information forms;
the new directive will be based on full harmonisation, with a few limited exceptions where, because of different legal traditions or
approaches, Member States will be allowed to maintain different solutions: this concerns in particular the possibility to make retailers
liable for the performance of a package in addition to organisers or to provide for a right of withdrawal for off-premises contracts, but
not for online or other distance contracts;
enhancing consumer protection: certain clarifications of the rules on contractual liability and remedies for lack of conformity in the
performance of the contract will increase consumer protection, whereas the detailed criteria for insolvency protection regimes should
ensure that the actual protection granted under the rules of the Member States will become more comparable, thereby strengthening
the basis for mutual recognition;
obligation for the Commission to present a report on online-bookings made at different points of sale already three years after its entry
into force: the Commission considered that this will be challenging to fulfil due to the short period the directive will have been
applicable at that point but acknowledged that this solution was necessary for Council and Parliament to come to an agreement.

2013/0246(COD) - 15/10/2015 Committee recommendation tabled for plenary, 2nd reading
The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection adopted the recommendation for second reading contained in the report by
Birgit COLLIN-LANGEN (EPP, DE) on the Council position at first reading with a view to the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament
and of the Council on package travel and linked travel arrangements, amending Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 and Directive 2011/83/EU of
the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Directive 90/314/EEC.
The committee recommended the European Parliament to approve, without amendment, the Council position at first reading. It took note of the
Commission statement annexed to this resolution.
The Commission declared that when revising the Commission staff working document of 3 December 2009 entitled "Guidance on the
implementation/application of Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices", it will also address the issue of commercial practices
whereby travel service providers who market their services online offer additional services in a hidden, unclear or ambiguous manner, such as
hiding the option of not booking any further services.
The Commission will inform Parliament on how its views have been taken into account when the revised Guidance is adopted.

2013/0246(COD) - 25/11/2015 Final act

PURPOSE: to update current EU rules on package holidays by aiming to adapt to travel market developments in order to meet the needs of
consumers and businesses in the digital era.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Directive (EU) 2015/2302 of the European Parliament and of the Council on package travel and linked travel
arrangements, amending Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 and Directive 2011/83/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council and
repealing Council Directive 90/314/EEC.
CONTENT: The purpose of this Directive is to contribute to the proper functioning of the internal market and to the achievement of a high and
as uniform as possible level of consumer protection by approximating certain aspects of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of
the Member States in respect of contracts between travellers and traders relating to package travel and linked travel arrangements .
The internet has become an increasingly important medium through which travel services are offered or sold. Travel services are not only
combined in the form of traditional pre-arranged packages, but are often combined in a customised way. This Directive aims to adapt the
scope of protection to take account of those developments, to enhance transparency, and to increase legal certainty for travellers and traders.
Member States shall not maintain or introduce, in their national law, more or less stringent provisions which would ensure a different level of
traveller protection.
Scope: this Directive applies to packages offered for sale or sold by traders to travellers and to linked travel arrangements facilitated by traders
for travellers. It covers:
packages where two or more travel services are purchased either from the same trader on a website or from a high street travel agent
under one contract;
"click-through" sales where two or more services are purchased from multiple on-line traders under separate contracts but where the
traveller's name, e-mail address and payment details are transferred directly between traders within 24 hours; and
linked travel arrangements, where at least two different travel services which are sold by a trader facilitating the travel arrangements
for the purpose of the same trip or holiday.
Pre-contractual information: according to the new Rules, Member States shall ensure that, before the traveller is bound by any package travel
contract or any corresponding offer, the organiser and, where the package is sold through a retailer, also the retailer shall provide the traveller
with the standard information, which shall include the following information:
the main characteristics of the travel services (e.g. the travel destination(s), itinerary and periods of stay, with dates and, where
accommodation is included, the number of nights included, the means, characteristics and categories of transport, the points, dates
and time of departure and return, the duration and places of intermediate stops and transport connections, tourist category of the
accommodation, the meal plan, visits, excursions, etc);
the trading name and geographical address of the organiser and, where applicable, of the retailer, as well as their telephone number
and, where applicable, e-mail address;
the total price of the package inclusive of taxes and, where applicable, of all additional fees;
the arrangements for payment, including any amount or percentage of the price which is to be paid as a down payment and the
timetable for payment of the balance, or financial guarantees to be paid or provided by the traveller;
general information on passport and visa requirements, including approximate periods for obtaining visas and information on health
formalities, of the country of destination;
information that the traveller may terminate the contract at any time before the start of the package in return for payment of an
appropriate termination fee;
information on optional or compulsory insurance to cover the cost of termination of the contract by the traveller or the cost of
assistance, including repatriation, in the event of accident, illness or death.
Member States shall ensure that package travel contracts are in plain and intelligible language and, in so far as they are in writing,
legible. The organiser or retailer shall provide the traveller with a copy or confirmation of the contract on a durable medium.
Changes to the contract: in certain cases organisers should be allowed to make unilateral changes to the package travel contract. However,
travellers should have the right to terminate the package travel contract if the changes alter significantly any of the main characteristics of the
travel services. If the organiser proposes a price increase of more than 8 % of the total price, the traveller should be entitled to terminate the
package travel contract without paying a termination fee. If the traveller terminates the package travel contract, the traveller may accept a
substitute package where this is offered by the organiser, if possible of an equivalent or a higher quality. If the package travel contract is
terminated and the traveller does not accept a substitute package, the organiser shall refund all payments made by or on behalf of the traveller
without undue delay and in any event not later than 14 days after the contract is terminated.
Termination and the right of withdrawal: Member States shall ensure that the traveller may terminate the package travel contract at any time
before the start of the package. Where the traveller terminates the package travel contract under this paragraph, the traveller may be required
to pay an appropriate and justifiable termination fee to the organiser. The traveller shall also have the right to terminate the package travel
contract before the start of the package without paying any termination fee in the event of unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances
occurring at the place of destination or its immediate vicinity and significantly affecting the performance of the package, or which significantly
affect the carriage of passengers to the destination. The traveller shall be entitled to a full refund of any payments made for the package, but
shall not be entitled to additional compensation.
Responsibility for the performance of the package: the organiser shall be responsible for the performance of the travel services included in the
package travel contract, irrespective of whether those services are to be performed by the organiser or by other travel service providers.
The Directive lays down rules for non-compliance of the package concerning price reduction, termination of the package travel contract and/or
compensation for damages:
if any of the travel services are not performed in accordance with the package travel contract, the organiser shall remedy the lack of
conformity, unless that: it is impossible; or entails disproportionate costs, taking into account the extent of the lack of conformity and
the value of the travel services affected;
where a significant proportion of the travel services cannot be provided as agreed in the package travel contract, the organiser shall
offer, at no extra cost to the traveller, suitable alternative arrangements of, where possible, equivalent or higher quality than those
specified in the contract, for the continuation of the package, including where the traveller's return to the place of departure is not
provided as agreed;

as long as it is impossible to ensure the traveller's return as agreed in the package travel contract because of unavoidable and
extraordinary circumstances, the organiser shall bear the cost of necessary accommodation, if possible of equivalent category, for a
period not exceeding three nights per traveller;
the traveller shall be entitled to receive appropriate compensation from the organiser for any damage which the traveller sustains as a
result of any lack of conformity. Compensation shall be made without undue delay.
Member States shall ensure that the traveller may address messages, requests or complaints in relation to the performance of the package
directly to the retailer through which it was purchased. The retailer shall forward those messages, requests or complaints to the organiser
without undue delay. The organiser shall give appropriate assistance without undue delay to the traveller in difficulty.
Insolvency protection: the Directive provides for more effective rules on insolvency protection for travellers in case of the trader's insolvency. A
network of central contact points in the member states will be created to facilitate cross-border cooperation.
Annex I and II: two annexes lay down in clear terms and in a standardised manner the rights and obligations of travellers and professionals in
the framework of package travel and linked travel arrangements
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 31.12.2015.
TRANSPOSITION: 01.01.2018 at the latest.
APPLICATION: from 01.07.2018, the date which Directive 90/134/EEC shall be repealed.
