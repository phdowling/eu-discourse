Summary

2013/0271(COD) - 25/07/2013 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 as regards the financial allocation for certain Member States from the European
Social Fund, in the context of the negotiation of the multiannual financial framework for the 2°14-2020 period.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: at the European Council of 27 and 28 June 2013, it was considered that a budgetary solution should be found to address
certain issues stemming from the final outcome of the negotiations of the Multiannual Financial Framework for the period 2014- 2020 for those
Member States most affected, namely France, Italy and Spain.
In view of the current economic crisis, as a contribution to the special effort needed to address the specific situations of unemployment, in
particular youth unemployment, and of poverty and social exclusion in these Member States, the European Social Fund allocations to those
three Member States for the year 2013 should be increased.
IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission did not undertake an impact assessment.
LEGAL BASIS: Article 177 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
CONTENT:
The Commission is proposing to amend Council Regulation (EC) 1083/2006 with a view to providing France, Italy and Spain with EUR 100
million, EUR 30 million and EUR 20 million respectively as additional commitments to their 2013 ESF allocations.
Nonetheless, since the amounts in the regulation are expressed in 2004 prices, the corresponding amounts quoted in the regulation total EUR
126 million broken down as follows:
EUR 84 million for France,
EUR 17 million for Spain, and
EUR 25 million for Italy.
The compensation will be provided from the 2007-2013 period with the amounts been made available through the flexibility instrument.
From a legal perspective, it is proposed to:
modify the Regulations articles dealing with: (i) global resources; (ii) on the resources available for the Convergence objective; (iii) the
resources available for the Regional competitiveness and employment objective and (iv) budget commitments;
modify Annex I on the annual breakdown of commitment appropriations and Annex II on the criteria and methodology for the allocation
of the resources.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: in total, EUR 150 million will be added to the 2013 commitments for France, Italy and Spain to be allocated to
the ESF.

2013/0271(COD) - 13/11/2013 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Regional Development adopted the report by Jan OLBRYCHT (EPP, PL) on the proposal for a regulation of the European
Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 as regards the financial allocation for certain Member States
from the European Social Fund.
The committee recommended the European Parliament to adopt its position at first reading, taking over the Commission proposal.

2013/0271(COD) - 20/11/2013 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 596 to 28, with 58 abstentions, legislative resolution of 20 November 2013 on the proposal for a
regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 as regards the financial allocation
for certain Member States from the European Social Fund.
Parliament adopted its position at first reading, under the ordinary legislative procedure, taking over the Commission proposal.

2013/0271(COD) - 11/12/2013 Final act
PURPOSE: to increase the European Social Fund (ESF) allocations to France, Italy and Spain for 2013.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Regulation (EU) No 1298/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No
1083/2006 as regards the financial allocation for certain Member States from the European Social Fund.
CONTENT: the Regulation increases the European Social Fund (ESF) allocations to France, Italy and Spain in commitments for 2013. It is to
contribute to the special effort needed to address the specific problems of unemployment, in particular youth unemployment, and of poverty

and social exclusion in these three countries.
For the year 2013, an additional envelope of EUR 125 513 290 under the ESF will be allocated as follows:
EUR 83 675 527 will be allocated to France,
EUR 25 102 658 will be allocated to Italy, and
EUR 16 735 105 will be allocated to Spain.
The Regulation amends the provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 that set the overall resources of the Funds for the objectives
to which they contribute (the convergence objective, and the objective of regional competitiveness and employment), as well as Annex II to
that Regulation establishing the criteria and methodology that are used for the indicative annual breakdowns of commitment appropriations by
Member States.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 21/12/2013.
