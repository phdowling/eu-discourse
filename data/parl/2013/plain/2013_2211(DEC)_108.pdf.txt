prepared on the basis of the information presented by the institutions, organisations and bodies of the EU, in accordance with Article 129 (2) of
the Financial Regulation applicable to the EU's General Budget, including the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction
(EMCDDA).
In 2012, the tasks and budget of this agency were as follows:

2013/2211(DEC) - 10/09/2013 Court of Auditors: opinion, report
PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug
Addiction for the financial year 2012, together with the Centres reply.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit concerned, amongst others, the annual accounts of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA).
In the Courts opinion, the Centres Annual Accounts fairly present, in all material respects, its financial position as of 31 December 2012 and
the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions of its financial rules and the
accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
The Court also considers that the transactions underlying the annual accounts of the Centre for the financial year ended 31 December 2012
are, in all material respects, legal and regular.
The report confirms that the Centres 2012 budget amounted to EUR 16.32 million.
The report also makes a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of the Centre, accompanied by the latters
response. The main observations may be summarised as follows:
The Courts observations:
internal controls: in 2012, the Centre gave grants to Member States national drug monitoring centres (beneficiaries) in order to support
cooperation under the REITOX network. Total grant expenditure in 2012 was EUR 2.6 million, representing 16 % of total operating
expenditure. The Centre does not usually obtain from beneficiaries any documents to substantiate the eligibility and accuracy of the
costs claimed. Ex post on-the-spot verifications of costs at beneficiary level are rare. Existing controls therefore provide only limited
assurance to the Centres management as to the eligibility and accuracy of the costs claimed by beneficiaries. For the transactions
audited by the Court supporting documentation was obtained by the Centre on the Courts behalf which provided reasonable
assurance as to their legality and regularity. Improvements are needed in this area;
headquarters: the Centre currently bears the annual cost of about 200 000 euro for unused office space in its former building and in
the new Headquarters. The Centre should continue, in cooperation with the Commission and National Authorities, to seek adequate
solutions for this unused office space.
The Centres replies:
audit: the Agency states that the EMCDDA has put in place and implemented several processes to ensure adequate ex ante and ex
post verifications taking into account the risks at stake. In this context, grant beneficiaries are requested to send a full overview of their
expenses (statement of expenses) as well as final financial and activity reports which allow EMCDDA to check the eligibility and
accuracy of the costs claimed. In order to further improve the system in place, EMCDDA has taken measures to improve the audit
methodology;
headquarters: EMCDDA continues actively to look for an adequate solution to sell or lease the premises concerned as well as
rationalising and reducing the maintenance costs for the Mascarenhas building, namely by revising the security settings and some
patterns for consumption of utilities.
Lastly, the Court of Auditors report contains a summary of the Centres activities in 2012. This is focused on the following:
running a computerised network for the collection and exchange of information called the European Information Network on Drugs and
Drug Addiction (Reitox);
various publications (e.g. annual report on the state of the drug problem in Europe; publication on selected issues; statistical bulletin
and interactive website);
setting-up/updating/content development of public EMCDDA website;
publication of promotional brochures, media products, press releases and fact sheets;
taking part in international conferences and organising scientific and technical meetings.

2013/2211(DEC) - 20/03/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Petri SARVAMAA (EPP, FI) on discharge in respect of the implementation of the
budget of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) for the financial year 2012, and called on the European
Parliament to grant the Director of the Centre discharge in respect of the implementation of the Centres budget for the financial year 2012.
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the Centre for the financial
year 2012 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Members approved the closure of the Centres accounts.
They made, however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is granted, in addition to the
general recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies.
·

Financing, budget and financial management: Members recalled that the budget of the Centre for the financial year 2012 was EUR
16 .3 million. They noted at the same time that that the budget monitoring efforts during the financial year 2012 resulted in a budget
implementation rate of 99.74 %.

·

Carryovers: they commended the Centre for adhering to the principle of annuality and for the timely execution of its budget.

Members also made a series of observations on transfers, procurement and recruitment procedures as well as comments on internal controls.
They noted with concern from the Court of Auditors annual audit report that the Centre currently bears the annual cost of about EUR 200 000
for unused office space in its former building and in the new headquarters. Members called on the Centre, as a matter of priority, to seek
adequate solutions for this unused office space, and to report to the discharge authority, within the framework of the 2012 discharge follow-up,
on the steps taken.
Lastly, they asked the Centre to strengthen transparency and prevent conflicts of interests, as well as make publicly available the Declarations
of Interests of certain members.

2013/2211(DEC) - 03/04/2014 Final act
PURPOSE: to grant discharge to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) for the financial year 2012.
