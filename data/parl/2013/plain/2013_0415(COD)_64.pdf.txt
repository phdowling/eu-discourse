2013/0415(COD) - 27/11/2013 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to amend Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing
the external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 lists the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing
the external borders (the so-called negative list (Annex I) and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement (the so-called positive
list (Annex II)). As the criteria set out in Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 can evolve over time in relation to third countries, the composition of the
negative and positive lists should be reviewed and amended when appropriate. Third countries for which the situation has changed as regards
these criteria, should be transferred from one Annex to the other.
CONTENT: following successful negotiations between the EU and Moldova and taking into consideration the progress made by Moldova in its
visa liberalisation dialogue during the last three years, the Commission proposes to transfer Moldova from the negative to the positive list,
however with a limitation of this visa waiver to the holders of biometric passports issued by Moldova in line with standards of the International
Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO).
BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this proposal has no implication on the European Union budget.

2013/0415(COD) - 13/02/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs adopted the report by Tanja FAJON (S&D, SI) on the proposal for a regulation of
the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in
possession of visas when crossing the external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement.

Following the positive outcomes of the Visa Dialogue, and keeping in mind that Moldova abolished visa obligations for all EU citizens in 2007,
the committee recommended the European Parliament to adopt its position at first reading taking over the Commission proposal.

2013/0415(COD) - 27/02/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 460 votes to 40, with 10 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in
possession of visas when crossing the external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement.
Parliament adopted its position at first reading under the ordinary legislative procedure taking over the Commission proposal.

2013/0415(COD) - 03/04/2014 Final act
PURPOSE: to amend Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 to include Moldava in the positive list in that Regulation (Annex II of the Regulation being
those countries whose nationals are exempt from the requirement that they have a visa when crossing the external borders of Member States
of the Union.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Regulation (EU) No 259/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No
539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders and those whose
nationals are exempt from that requirement
BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 lists the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing
the external borders (the negative list) and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement (the positive list).
As the criteria set out in Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 can evolve over time in relation to third countries, the composition of the negative and
positive lists should be reviewed and amended when appropriate. Third countries, for which the situation has changed as regards these
criteria, should be transferred from one Annex to the other.
CONTENT: In line with the Joint Declaration approved at the Prague Eastern Partnership Summit on 7 May 2009, and the completion by the
Republic of Moldova of its Visa Liberalisation Action Plan, Moldova meets all the benchmarks set out in the Visa Liberalisation Action Plan.
The Regulation transfers Moldavia from the negative list in Regulation 539/2001 to the positive list, with a limitation of the visa waiver to the
holders of biometric passports issued by Moldova in line with standards of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO).
Territorial provisions: the United Kingdom and Ireland are not taking part in the adoption of the Regulation and are not bound by it or subject to
its application.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 28.04.2014.
