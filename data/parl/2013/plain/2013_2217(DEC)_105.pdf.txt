2013/2217(DEC) - 10/09/2013 Court of Auditors: opinion, report
PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the European Training Foundation (ETF) for the
financial year 2012, together with the Foundations reply.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit concerned, amongst others, the annual accounts of the European Training Foundation (ETF).
In the Courts opinion, the Foundations Annual Accounts fairly present, in all material respects, its financial position as of 31 December 2012
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions of its financial rules and the
accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
The Court also considers that the transactions underlying the annual accounts of the Foundation for the financial year ended 31 December
2012 are, in all material respects, legal and regular.
The report confirms that the Foundations 2012 budget amounted to EUR 20.1 million.
The report also makes a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of the Foundation, accompanied by the latters
response. The main observations may be summarised as follows:
The Courts observations:
budgetary management: in 2012 the overall level of committed appropriations was 99,9 %, indicating that commitments were made in
a timely manner. The level of committed appropriations carried over to 2013 however was high for title II (administrative expenditure)
at EUR 600 000 (36,8 %). The main reasons were the late receipt of invoices for building-related services delivered in 2012 and a
number of IT hardware and software purchases ordered as planned during the last months of 2012 but not delivered until 2013.
The Foundations replies:
budgetary management: the Foundation states that of the EUR 590 000 in commitments carried forward for administrative expenses,
some EUR 300 000 related to activities completed in 2012 but paid only in 2013 owing to invoicing and payment processing times.
ETF will continue to pay great attention to the principle of annuality of the budget while ensuring sound management of the financial
resources entrusted to it.
Lastly, the Court of Auditors report contains a summary of the Foundations activities in 2012. This is focused on the following:
improvement of human capital development in 30 partner countries;
regional policy learning conferences that enabled stakeholders to share cross- countries experience on policy developments. Two
Corporate conferences were organised in 2012 one in May on the topic of Multi-level Governance in the field of Vocational Education
and Training and another one in November on the topic of Entrepreneurship;
supporting the EU policies and project cycle of external relations instruments for the partner countries;
capacity building of partner countries;
policy analysis;
dissemination and networking;
responses to the Commission on the management of training in third countries.

The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Petri SARVAMAA (EPP, FI) on discharge in respect of the implementation of the
budget of the European Training Foundation for the financial year 2012, and called on the European Parliament to grant the Director of the

year 2012 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Members approved the closure of the Foundations accounts.
They made, however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is granted, in addition to the
general recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies.
·

Financing, budget and financial management: Members recalled that the budget of the Foundation for the financial year 2012 was
EUR 20.20 million, and that budget monitoring efforts during the financial year 2012 resulted in a budget implementation rate of
99.91 %.

appreciated that the main reasons were the late receipt of invoices for building-related services delivered in 2012.

Lastly, they asked the Foundation to strengthen transparency and prevent conflicts of interests, as well as make publicly available the
