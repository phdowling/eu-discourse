2013/2034(INI) - 05/06/2013 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Foreign Affairs unanimously adopted the own-initiative report by Alexander Graf LAMBSDORFF (ADLE, DE) with a
proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on the 68th Session of the United Nations General Assembly.
Recalling that growing globalisation and fragmentation of global policy-making are both creating new complexities in international relations,
Members address the following recommendations to the Council:
The EU as a global actor: Members state that it is necessary to ensure continuously the coherence and visibility of the EU as a global actor at
the UN. In this regard, there is a need to strengthen the ability of the EU to act in a coordinated, swift and comprehensive manner in the global
arena.
The EU and global governance: Members call for enhanced cooperation with partners in making the UN a more effective and cohesive
organisation for the 21st century. They encourage a comprehensive and consensual reform of the United Nations Security Council and await a
concrete proposal on how to achieve, as a central, long-term goal of the EU, a common EU seat in an enlarged UNSC. Once again, they ask
for a common position of the EU Member States to that end.
Peace and security: Members suggest incorporating a peace-building perspective into peacekeeping operations and enhancing closer
coordination between peacekeeping operations and UN Country Teams and development actors. Cooperation is also needed with other
regional organisations such as NATO, OSCE, ASEAN, CELAC, Arab League, etc. in preventing conflicts and in post-conflict countries. Overall,
Members recommend working towards establishing the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) as a new norm of international law, in compliance with
international humanitarian law and as a follow-up on proposals presented by Parliament in its recommendation to the Council on the UN
principle of the R2P.
They demand of all parties, whether state and non-state actors directly or indirectly involved in armed conflict, that they fully respect their
obligations under international law.
Members recommend cooperation with multilateral and bilateral partners towards adding more robust and effective pressure in order to put an
immediate end to the violation of human rights and violence in Syria. They call on the US, Turkey and the League of Arab States to put
pressure on the Syrian government and all those involved in the crisis.
The call for further efforts to find a political solution to the conflict in Mali and to foster a democratic transition by consolidating the institutions of
transition, promoting inter alia through mediation inclusive national dialogue and reconciliation.
Human rights, democracy and the rule of law: the recommendation calls for strengthened international efforts aimed at ensuring that all human
rights agreed under UN conventions are considered universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated and that their respect is being
enforced. They oppose attempts to undermine humanitarian law in the fight against terrorism and call for the mainstreaming of human rights,
including digital freedoms, and basic freedoms in all aspects of the UNs work.
Members make a list of human rights to be respected and highlight in particular the freedom of the press and media worldwide, respect for the
International Criminal Court, the fight against corruption and respect for civil society.
Sustainable development: once again, Members call for enhanced policy coherence as regards development and for determined efforts to
combat poverty. Specific recommendations are made to combat the recurring food crises in the Sahel region and the Horn of Africa. The
recommendations also seek to: (i) honour the international undertaking of the EU and the Member States to earmark 0.7% of GDP for
development aid; (ii) promote universal access to water and affordable and sustainable energy services; (iii) work towards an ambitious
post-2015 MDG Agenda.
Lastly, Members call for the promotion of interaction on global issues between governments and parliaments and for enhanced follow up to the
recommendations adopted by Parliament, including by inviting the European External Action Service to report back to it every year on the
outcome of the General Assembly.

2013/2034(INI) - 11/06/2013 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament recommendation to the Council with a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on the
68th Session of the United Nations General Assembly was deemed adopted without vote.
The recommendation recalls that the UN is at the centre of global governance. A solid and stable EU-UN partnership underpins and
contributes to the work of the UN under all three pillars peace and security, human rights and development. The EU must meet its
responsibility to play a part in devising joint approaches to global challenges. However, the fragmentation of global policy-making, combined
with a proliferation of international and transnational forums, is creating new complexities in international relations.

In this regard, Parliament addresses the following recommendations to the Council:
The EU as a global actor: Parliament states that it is necessary to ensure continuously the coherence and visibility of the EU as a global actor
at the UN. There is also a need to strengthen the ability of the EU to act in a coordinated, swift and comprehensive manner in the global arena.
The EU and global governance: Parliament calls for enhanced cooperation with partners in making the UN a more effective and cohesive
organisation for the 21st century. It encourages a comprehensive and consensual reform of the United Nations Security Council and awaits a
concrete proposal on how to achieve, as a central, long-term goal of the EU, a common EU seat in an enlarged UNSC. Once again, Members
call for a common position of the EU Member States to that end.
Peace and security: Parliament suggests incorporating a peace-building perspective into peacekeeping operations and enhancing closer
coordination between peacekeeping operations and UN Country Teams and development actors. Cooperation is also needed with other
regional organisations such as NATO, OSCE, ASEAN, CELAC, Arab League, etc. in preventing conflicts and in post-conflict countries. Overall,

fully respect their obligations under international law.
Members recommend cooperation with multilateral and bilateral partners towards adding more robust and effective pressure in order to put an
immediate end to the violation of human rights and violence in Syria. They call on the US, Turkey and the League of Arab States to put
pressure on the Syrian government and all those involved in the crisis. Swift provision of cross-border humanitarian assistance, basic public
services as well as full access for humanitarian organisations is needed urgently.
Parliament calls for further efforts to find a political solution to the conflict in Mali and to foster a democratic transition by consolidating the
institutions of transition, promoting inter alia through mediation inclusive national dialogue and reconciliation.
Human rights, democracy and the rule of law: the recommendation calls for strengthened international efforts aimed at ensuring that all human
