OJ L 179 19.06.2014, p. 0001 Summary

2013/0388(NLE) - 08/11/2013 Initial legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude a new Fisheries Protocol between the EU and the Comoros.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
BACKGROUND: on the basis of the powers conferred on it by the Council, the European Commission has conducted negotiations with the
Union of the Comoros with a view to renewing the Protocol to the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the
Union of the Comoros. At the end of the negotiations a new draft protocol was initialled by the negotiators on 5 July 2013. It is now necessary
to conclude this Protocol on behalf of the EU.

CONTENT: this proposal seeks the conclusion of the Protocol between the European Union and the Comoros setting out the fishing
opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the two parties currently in force. The
main aim of the Protocol to the Agreement is to provide fishing opportunities for European Union vessels in the fishing zone of the Union of the
Comoros within the limits of the available surplus.
Towards sustainable fishing: the general aim is to strengthen the cooperation between the European Union and the Comoros, thereby creating
a partnership framework within which to develop a sustainable fisheries policy and sound exploitation of fisheries resources in the fishing zone
of the Union of the Comoros, in the interests of both parties.
Financial contribution: the overall annual financial contribution should is set at EUR 600 000/year over the entire reference period. This is
based on:
a reference tonnage of 6 000 tonnes, for an amount of EUR 300 000 linked to access. If the overall quantity of catches by EU vessels
in the fishing zone of the Union of the Comoros exceeds the reference tonnage, the total amount of the annual financial contribution
shall be increased by EUR 50 for each additional tonne caught during the year in question. However, the total annual amount paid by
the European Union shall not be more than twice the amount. Where the quantities caught by EU vessels exceed the quantities
corresponding to twice the total annual amount, the amount due for the quantity exceeding that limit shall be paid the following year;
support for the development of the sectoral fisheries policy of the Union of the Comoros amounting to EUR 300 000. This support
meets the objectives of the national fisheries policy and in particular the needs of the Union of the Comoros in the fight against illegal
fishing.
Fishing opportunities: 42 tuna seiners and 20 surface longliners shall be authorised to fish. The Joint Committee may review these fishing
opportunities and adjust them by mutual agreement, provided that they continue to comply with the principles of sustainable fishing. In this
case, the financial contribution shall be adjusted proportionately and pro rata temporis.
Where necessary the Joint Committee may examine and adapt, by mutual agreement, the provisions governing the pursuit of fishing activities
and the rules for implementing this Protocol and the Annexes thereto.
Duration of the Agreement: the Protocol should apply from 1 January 2014 and for a period of three years.
In addition, the Protocol contains specific clauses for its suspension or termination.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the total financial envelope allocated to this Protocol would be EUR 2.132 million from 2014 to 2016, including
administrative costs for the management of the Protocol and human resources expenditure.

2013/0388(NLE) - 06/12/2013 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude the Protocol between the EU and the Comoros setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided
for in the Fisheries Partnership Agreement.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: the European Union has negotiated with the Union of the Comoros a new protocol to the Partnership Agreement granting
vessels of the European Union fishing opportunities in Comoros waters.
That new protocol was signed on the basis of a Decision and is provisionally applicable as from 1 January 2014.
Given that it is in the interest of the European Union to implement the Partnership Agreement by means of a Protocol establishing the fishing
opportunities and the corresponding financial contribution, and setting out the conditions for promoting responsible and sustainable fishing in
Comoros waters, it is now necessary to approve the new Protocol on behalf of the European Union.
CONTENT: under this proposal, the Council is invited to approve, on behalf of the European Union, the Protocol setting out the fishing
opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Fisheries Partnership Agreement with the Comoros.
The draft Protocol seeks to strengthen the cooperation between the European Union and the Comoros, thereby creating a partnership
framework within which to develop a sustainable fisheries policy and sound exploitation of fisheries resources in the fishing zone of the Union
of the Comoros, in the interests of both parties.
For further information as regards the financial implications of the draft Protocol and its impact on the EU budget, please refer to the summary
of the Commissions initial legislative proposal dated 08/11/2013.
Simplified procedure to define the EUs position within the EU-Comores Joint Committee: the Partnership Agreement sets up a Joint
Committee which is responsible for monitoring the application of this Agreement. Furthermore, in accordance with the Protocol, the Joint
Committee may approve certain modifications to the Protocol. In order to facilitate the approval of such modifications, it is appropriate to
empower the Commission, subject to specific conditions, to approve them under a simplified procedure.
Annex: the draft Decision outlines the scope of the powers conferred on the Commission as well as the procedure to establish the Unions
position within the Joint Committee. The Commission should be authorised to negotiate with the Comoros and, where appropriate, agree on
modifications to the Protocol in respect of the following issues:
review of fishing opportunities;
decision on the modalities of the sectoral support;
implementation of the Protocol and the Annexes thereto.
In the Joint Committee, the European Union should act in accordance with the objectives pursued by the European Union within the framework
of the Common Fisheries Policy as well as with the relevant rules adopted by Regional Fisheries Management Organisations. The necessary
steps shall be taken so that the position to be expressed on the European Union's behalf takes account of the latest statistical, biological and
other relevant information transmitted to the Commission.

Technical provisions have been provided laying down the practical arrangements for the approval of such amendments to the Protocol.

2013/0388(NLE) - 13/05/2014 Final act
PURPOSE: to conclude a new Protocol on fisheries between the EU and the Comores.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Council Decision 2014/369/EU on the conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Protocol between the
European Union and the Union of the Comoros setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Fisheries
Partnership Agreement currently in force between the two parties.
CONTEXT: on 5 October 2006, the Council approved the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the
Comores.
The European Union has negotiated with the Comoros a new protocol to the Partnership Agreement granting vessels of the European Union
fishing opportunities in Comoros waters.
That new protocol was signed on the basis of Council Decision 2013/786/EU, and is provisionally applicable as from 1 January 2014.
Knowing it is in the interest of the European Union to implement the Partnership Agreement by means of a Protocol, it is necessary to approve
the new Protocol on behalf of the EU.
CONTENT: by this Decision, the Council, subject to approval from the European Parliament, approves in the name of the Union, a protocol to
the Partnership Agreement on the fisheries sector concluded with the Comores. The Protocol provides in particular fishing opportunities for
European Union vessels within the fishing waters of the Comores within the limits of the available balance.
The Fisheries Protocol contains in particular the following elements:
Financial contribution: the overall annual financial contribution for the Fisheries Protocol has been set at EUR 600 000/year over the entire
reference period.
This is based on:
a reference tonnage of 6 000 tonnes, linked to access, for an amount of EUR 300 000/year. However, if the overall quantity of catches
by EU vessels in the fishing zone of the Union of the Comoros exceeds the reference tonnage, the total amount of the annual financial
contribution shall be increased by EUR 50 for each additional tonne caught during the year in question. The total annual amount paid

by the European Union shall not be more than twice the amount. Where the quantities caught by EU vessels exceed the quantities
corresponding to twice the total annual amount, the amount due for the quantity exceeding that limit shall be paid the following year;
support for the development of the sectoral fisheries policy of the Union of the Comoros amounting to EUR 300 000. This support
meets the objectives of the national fisheries policy and in particular the needs of the Union of the Comoros in the fight against illegal
fishing.
Fishing opportunities: concerning fishing opportunities, 42 tuna seiners and 20 surface longliners shall be authorised to fish.
The Joint Committee may review these fishing opportunities and adjust them by mutual agreement, provided that they continue to comply with
the principles of sustainable fishing. In this case, the financial contribution shall be adjusted proportionately and pro rata temporis.
Duration of the Agreement: the Protocol should apply from 1 January 2014 and for a period of three years.
Specific clauses for suspension or termination of the Protocol have also been provided.
Simplified procedure to define the position of the EU relating to the EU-Comores Joint Committee: the Partnership Agreement set up a Joint
Committee which is responsible for monitoring the application of this Agreement. Furthermore, in accordance with the Protocol, the Joint
Committee may approve certain modifications to the Protocol. In order to facilitate the approval of such modifications, it is appropriate to
empower the Commission, subject to specific conditions, to approve them under a simplified procedure.
Annex: the Decision details the scope of the empowerment and procedure for the establishment of the European Union position in the Joint
Committee. The Commission would thus be authorised to negotiate with the Comoros, modifications in respect of:
review of fishing opportunities;
modalities of the fisheries sectoral support;
implementation of the Protocol and its Annexes.
In the Joint Committee, the Union should act in accordance with the objectives within the framework of the Common Fisheries Policy as well
as the relevant rules adopted by Regional Fisheries Management Organisations. Moreover, the Joint Committee should base its decisions on
the latest statistical, biological and other relevant information.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: the Decision enters into force on 13.05.2014.
