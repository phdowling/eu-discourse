2013/0376(NLE) - 06/11/2013 Initial legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to ratify the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCC).
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: the Council agreed, in its conclusions of 9 March 2012, to propose a joint quantified emission reduction commitment of 20%
for the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol for the Union.
In December 2012, at the Doha Climate Change Conference, the 192 Parties to the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change adopted an amendment to the Protocol. This ?Doha Amendment? establishes a second commitment period
under the Kyoto Protocol, starting on 1 January 2013 and ending on 31 December 2020, with legally binding emission reduction commitments
for the Parties listed in its Annex B.
The agreement on the Doha Amendment came as part of a broader package.
Apart from the 38 Parties covered under the second commitment period, more than 60 other countries, including the United States,
China, India, South Africa and Brazil, have now pledged mitigation action under the UNFCCC. This brings the total share of global
emissions covered by international mitigation commitments under both the Kyoto Protocol and the Convention to more than 80%.
A further essential element of this broader package is the consensus of Parties to the Convention, no later than 2015, to adopt a
protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to all Parties, which should
come into effect and be implemented from 2020.
Under the Doha Amendment, the European Union, its Member States and Iceland commit to limit their average annual greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions in the years 2013 to 2020 to 80 % of their base year emissions (mostly 1990).
The Doha Amendment also makes further amendments to the text of the Protocol to be implemented in the second commitment period. these
amendments concern: (i) the inclusion of a new gas - nitrogen trifluoride (NF3); (ii) an ?ambition mechanism? which provides for a simplified
procedure which allows a Party to adjust its commitment by increasing its ambition during a commitment period; (iii) a provision which
automatically adjusts a Party?s target to prevent an increase in its emissions for the period 2013 to 2020 beyond its average emissions for the
years 2008 to 2010.
IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken.
LEGAL BASIS: Article 192(1), in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
CONTENT: the proposal for a Council Decision provides the basis for the conclusion of the Doha Amendment by the European Union and sets
out the terms of the joint fulfilment of the commitments by the European Union, its Member States and Iceland. It is accompanied by a
proposal for a regulation on technical issues related to implementation by the EU and Member States of the second commitment period.
The ratification Decision enables the EU, as a Party to the Kyoto Protocol, to ratify the Doha amendment. It also sets out the terms according
to which the EU, its Member States and Iceland will fulfil the 20% emissions reduction commitment jointly.
The formal entry into force of the Doha Amendment is an important objective for the European Union.
The Commission would like Member States to take the necessary steps to complete their domestic ratification processes not later than 16
February 2015. Once they have finalised their own ratification processes, Member States together with the EU, will simultaneously deposit
their instruments of acceptance to enable simultaneous entry into force for all of them. This should take place well before the Paris Climate
Change Conference at the end of 2015.
On the international level, the Doha amendment will enter into force when it has been ratified by three quarters of Parties to the Protocol (144
of the 192 Parties). The European Union is a Party to the Protocol in its own right, as are all Member States and Iceland.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the budget of the European Union.

2013/0376(NLE) - 09/01/2015 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to enable the ratification of the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change (UNFCC).
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: at the Doha Climate Change Conference in December 2012, parties to the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change adopted the Doha Amendment, establishing a second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, starting on 1
January 2013 and ending on 31 December 2020.
The Doha Amendment amends Annex B to the Kyoto Protocol, setting out further legally-binding mitigation commitments for parties listed in
that Annex for the second commitment period.
The Union and its Member States agreed to the Doha Amendment as part of a package whereby parties to the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change agreed to adopt, by the end of 2015, a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal
force under the Convention applicable to all parties, which should come into effect and be implemented from 2020.
The Council agreed, in its conclusions of 9 March 2012, to propose a joint quantified emission reduction commitment of 20% for the second

commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol for the Union and its Member States. The Council further agreed, in line with this approach, that the
emission reduction obligations of individual Member States are not to exceed the obligations agreed in Union legislation, and that the
commitment is to be based on the sum of base year emissions of the Member States in accordance with the Kyoto Protocol. Accordingly, the
Union and its Member States agreed at the Doha Climate Change Conference to a quantified emission reduction commitment that limits their
average annual emissions of greenhouse gases during the second commitment period to 80% of the sum of their base year emissions. This is
reflected in the Doha Amendment.
The Union and its Member States have also offered to move to a 30% reduction by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, as part of a global and
comprehensive agreement for the period beyond 2012, provided that other developed countries commit themselves to comparable emission
reductions, and that developing countries contribute adequately according to their responsibilities and respective capabilities.
The targets for the Union and its Member States are listed in the Doha Amendment with a footnote stating that those targets are based on the
understanding that they will be fulfilled jointly by the European Union and its Member States.
The Union, its Member States, Croatia and Iceland also stated, in a joint statement that they intend to jointly fulfil their commitments during the
second commitment period. In the same statement, they stated that Article 3(7ter) of the Kyoto Protocol will be applied to the joint assigned
amount pursuant to the agreement on joint fulfilment by the Union, its Member States, Croatia and Iceland and will not be applied to any
Member State, Croatia or Iceland individually. The Council, at its meeting on 15 December 2009, welcomed a request by Iceland to fulfil its
commitments under a second commitment period jointly with the Union and its Member States . An agreement has been found between the
parties.
The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol has decided that each party with a commitment
listed for the second commitment period should, by 15 April 2015, submit to the Convention Secretariat a report to facilitate the calculation of
its assigned amount. The Commission should prepare a report to facilitate the calculation of the assigned amount of the Union, and a report to
facilitate the calculation of the joint assigned amount of the Union, its Member States and Iceland.
In order to underline the commitment of the Union and its Member States to a timely entry into force of the Doha Amendment, the Union, its
Member States and Iceland should endeavour to ratify it not later than the first quarter of 2015.
The Doha Amendment should be approved on behalf of the Union.
CONTENT: under this proposed Decision, the Council is requested to approve, on behalf of the Union, the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto
Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change agreed on 8 December 2012 in Doha.
The text of the Doha Amendment is attached to this Decision.
Notification: the EU and its Member States shall fulfil their commitments in accordance with the notification of the terms of the agreement to
fulfil jointly the commitments of the European Union, its Member States and Iceland as set out in Annex I to this Decision.
The assigned amounts of the Member States and Iceland shall be equal to the emission levels set out in the notification.
By 15 April 2015, each Member State shall submit to the Convention Secretariat a report to facilitate the calculation of its assigned amount, in
accordance with the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol, the Doha Amendment and decisions adopted thereunder.
The Commission shall prepare a report to facilitate the calculation of the assigned amount of the Union, and a report to facilitate the calculation
of the joint assigned amount of the Union, its Member States and Iceland.
For further details of the protocol, please refer to the summary of the Commissions initial legislative proposal dated 06/11/2013.

2013/0376(NLE) - 18/05/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety adopted the report by Elisabetta GARDINI (EPP, IT) on the draft Council
decision on the conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change and the joint fulfilment of commitments thereunder.
The committee recommended that the European Parliament give its consent to the conclusion of the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol.
The Doha amendment establishes a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol (KP CP2), starting on 1 January 2013 and ending
on 31 December 2020, with legally binding emission reduction commitments according to which the European Union, its Member States and
Iceland are committed to limit their average annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the years 2013 to 2020 to 80% of their base year
emissions (mostly 1990). That commitment was determined on the basis of the total greenhouse gas emissions allowed during the period
2013-2020 under the EU Climate and Energy Package.
Alongside with it, the Doha Amendment makes three more changes to the text of the Kyoto Protocol to be implemented in this second
commitment period which concern the following:
the inclusion of a new gas (nitrogen trifluoride);
an ambition mechanism providing for a simplified procedure to allow a Party to adjust its commitment by increasing its ambition during
a commitment period;
a provision which automatically adjusts a Party's target to prevent an increase in its emissions for the period 2013 to 2020 beyond its
average emissions for the years 2008 to 2010.
Although Iceland is not an EU Member State, it does participate in the EU ETS and it intends to fulfil its commitment in KP CP2 jointly with the
EU and its Member States.
Members considered that the ratification decision on the conclusion of the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol and the joint fulfilment of
the commitments by the European Union will send a strong signal about the efforts and the leadership of the EU and its Member States to
address climate change at international level.
The Council should ensure that the domestic ratification processes in the Member States can take place no later than the third quarter of 2015

and together with the EU and that the Members States and the Union can deposit their instrument of acceptance well before the Paris Climate
Change Conference in 2015.

2013/0376(NLE) - 10/06/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
