2013/2214(DEC) - 10/09/2013 Court of Auditors: opinion, report

PURPOSE: presentation of the report of the Court of Auditors on the annual accounts of the Translation Centre for the Bodies of the European
Union for the financial year 2012, together with the Centres replies (CdT).
CONTENT: in line with the tasks and objectives conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, it
provides in the context of the discharge procedure, both in Parliament and Council, a Statement of Assurance concerning the reliability of the
accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions of each institution, body or agency of the EU, based on an independent
external audit.
This audit also focused on the annual accounts of the Centre CdT.
On issuing this audit, in the Courts opinion, the Centres annual accounts present fairly, in all material respects, its financial position as at 31
December 2012, as well as the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions of its
Financial Regulation and the accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
It also considered that the transactions underlying the annual accounts for the year ended 31 December 2012 are legal and regular in all
material respects.
The report also confirmed that the resources made available to the Centre in 2012 were EUR 48 293 million.
The report of the Court of Auditors at the same time has a series of observations on budget management and financial agency, together with
the responses of the latter. The main observations can be summarised as follows:
Observations of the Court:
·

budget surplus: at the end of 2012, the Centre held cash and short term deposits amounting to 35 million euro (budgetary surplus
and reserves amounting to 30.9 million euro). The Centre cannot adjust prices during the year in order to balance income and
expenditure although it has occasionally refunded its clients in order to reduce the surplus;

·

revision of the Centres Founding Regulation: the Founding Regulation of 20 regulatory agencies audited by the Court in 2012
requires them to use the Centre for all their translation needs (the Centres Founding Regulation stipulates the same for four other
agencies). Other agencies are not obliged to use the Centre. For non-technical documents agencies could reduce their costs by
using local services. In the Courts opinion the legislator should consider allowing all agencies to do so.

Responses of the Centre:
·

budget surplus: the cumulative budget surplus that may be reimbursed to clients amounts to 3.9 million euro, with the remaining part
of the budget surplus being blocked by the statutory reserve and other reserves created by the Centre for specific purposes. In the
long term, based on the Centres pricing policy, the Centre should balance its costs with its revenues. The prices of the Centres
products are fixed by the Management Board for one year and, therefore, the surplus of 3.9 million euro will be reflected in the price
modification for 2014 in order to assure long-term equilibrium.

·

revision of texts: the Translation Centre takes due note of the Courts observation. The Centre stresses, however, that the opinion of
the Court deviates from the framework established by the legislator in the Founding Regulation of the agencies.

Finally, the report of the Couirt of Auditors summarises the activities of the Centre in 2012. It is particularly focused on the following activities:
number of pages translated: 735 007 pages against 712 813 the previous year;
number of pages by languages: in the official EU languages: 722 505 pages; in other languages: 12 502 pages;
number of pages per client: bodies: 707 888 pages; institutions: 27 119 pages;
number of pages translated by freelancers: 480 695 pages.

2013/2214(DEC) - 20/03/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Petri SARVAMAA (EPP, FI) in which it recommended the European Parliament to
grant discharge to the Director of the Translation Centre for the Bodies (CdT) of the European Union in respect of the implementation of the
Centre's budget for the financial year 2012.
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the Centre for the financial
year 2012 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Members approved the closure of the Centres accounts.
They made, however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is granted, in addition to the
general recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies.
Budget and financial management: Members noted that budget monitoring efforts during the financial year 2012 resulted in a budget
implementation rate of 87.45% and that the payment appropriations execution rate was 90.23%. They noted that the Centre held cash
and short term deposits amounting to EUR 35 million at the end of 2012. They noted that the Centre cannot adjust prices during the
year in order to balance income and expenditure, although it has occasionally refunded its clients in order to reduce the surplus.
Members called on the Centre to propose a remedy to this situation.
Members also made a series of observations on transfers, procurement and recruitment procedures as well as comments on internal controls.
Lastly, they acknowledged that the Centre will assess its policy on the prevention and management of conflicts of interests on the basis of the
Commission's Guidelines on the Prevention and Management of Conflict of Interest in EU Decentralised Agencies. They called on the Centre
to inform the discharge authority of the assessment results once available.
