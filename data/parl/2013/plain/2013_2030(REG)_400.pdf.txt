Summary

2013/2030(REG) - 21/05/2013 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament decided to append the following interpretation to Rule 156(6) of the Rules of Procedure (oral amendments and other
oral modifications):

?On a proposal from the President, an oral amendment, or any other oral modification, shall be treated in the same way as an amendment not
distributed in all the official languages. If the President considers it admissible under Rule 157(3), and save in the case of objection under Rule
156(6), it shall be put to the vote in accordance with the order of voting established.
In committee, the number of votes needed to object to such an amendment or such a modification is established on the basis of Rule 196
proportionally to that applicable in plenary, rounded up where necessary to the nearest complete number.?
