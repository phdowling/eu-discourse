2013/2247(DEC) - 26/07/2013 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: presentation by the Commission of the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2012, as part of
the 2012 discharge procedure.
Analysis of the accounts of the ITER Joint Undertaking.
CONTENT: this Commission document sets out the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2012 as
prepared on the basis of the information presented by the institutions, organisations and bodies of the EU, in accordance with Article 129 (2) of
the Financial Regulation applicable to the EU's General Budget, including the ITER Joint Undertaking.
In 2012, the tasks and budget of the Joint Undertaking were as follows:
description of the tasks of the Joint Undertaking: the Joint Undertaking is located in Barcelona, while the main fusion facilities are to be
developed at Cadarache, in France. It was set up under Council Decision 2007/198/Euratom for a period of 35 years. ITER involves
the EU and China, India, Russia, South Korea, Japan and USA. It was created to manage the ITER facilities, to encourage the
exploitation of the ITER facilities, to promote public understanding and acceptance of fusion energy, and to undertake any other
activities that are necessary to achieve its purpose;
budget of the Joint Undertaking for the 2012 financial year: the EU (Euratom) contribution to ITER International is given through the
Fusion for Energy Agency, including also the contributions from Member States and from Switzerland. The total contribution is legally
considered as a Euratom contribution to ITER since the Member States and Switzerland do not have ownership interests in ITER. As
the EU legally holds the participation in the joint venture ITER International, the Commission must recognise the participation in its
accounts. At 31 December 2012, the Commission held 44.25 % of the ownership participation in ITER. The total (indicative) Euratom
contribution foreseen for ITER (from 2007 to 2041) is EUR 8 949 million.
Please also consult ITER Joint Undertakings final accounts.

2013/2247(DEC) - 22/10/2013 Court of Auditors: opinion, report
PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the European Joint Undertaking for ITER and the
Development of Fusion Energy for the financial year 2012, together with the replies of the Joint Undertaking.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.

This audit concerned, amongst others, the annual accounts of the European Joint Undertaking for ITER and the Development of Fusion
Energy (F4E).
In the Courts opinion, the annual accounts of the Joint Undertaking fairly present, in all material respects, its financial position as of 31
December 2012 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions of its Financial
Regulation and the accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
The Court also considers that the transactions underlying the annual accounts of the Joint Undertaking for ITER and the Development of
Fusion Energy for the financial year ended 31 December 2012 are, in all material respects, legal and regular.
The resources available to the Joint Undertaking in 2012 amounted to amounted to EUR 379.5 million of final revenue (payment
appropriations), of which 76.5% funded by Community contribution.
The report also makes a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of the Joint Undertaking, accompanied by the
latters response. The main observations may be summarised as follows:
Courts comments:
presentation of the accounts: there is a lack of certain information as regards procurement which is essential to reflect the status of the
activities carried out so far by F4E as regards the procurement arrangements signed with the ITER International Organisation;
internal control: the Court notes that the Joint Undertakings internal control systems had not been fully established and implemented.
Although significant progress was made during 2012, a number of actions still need to be implemented;
operational procurement and grants: the Court states that negotiated procedures constituted 40% of all operational tendering
procedures launched in 2012 (65% in 2011). The Joint Undertaking still needs to increase the competitiveness of procurement
procedures and further reduce the use of negotiated procedures;
host state agreement: according to the Host State Agreement signed with Spain on 28 June 2007, permanent premises should have
been made available to the Joint Undertaking by June 2010. At the time of the audit (April 2013), this had not occurred.
Joint Undertakings replies:
audits: improvements have been made according to ITER as regards the audits, despite the Courts observations. Progress has also bee made
in the implementation of the action plans;
public procurement: due to their low average value, negotiated procedures correspond to 40 % of yearly operational procurement
procedures but only to less than 10 % of the JU's yearly commitment: in this respect the use of low-value negotiated procedures
allows the JU to focus the limited internal resources on the high value/high risk procurements, with a beneficial risk mitigating effect;
host agreement: the Host Agreement signed between Fusion and for Energy and Spain in 2007 does indeed foresee that Spain will
provide F4E with permanent premises no later than 3 years after the signature of the agreement. While Spain has not yet provided
permanent premises, the Joint Undertaking occupies temporary premises free of cost, as Spain pays for the full cost of the premises
(rent and maintenance as foreseen by the Host Agreement, while F4E pays for the tenant's part of the temporary premises). In order
to provide the final premises, Spain launched an informal procedure to select an appropriate site and architectural project. The
selection of the site and project is foreseen to take place before the end of 2013.
As regards the activities of the Joint Undertaking in 2012, the report refers to the Annual Activity Report 2012 which can be found at

2013/2247(DEC) - 20/03/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Paul RÜBIG (PPE, AT) on discharge in respect of the implementation of the
budget of European Joint Undertaking for ITER and the Development of Fusion Energy for the financial year 2012, and called on the European
Parliament to grant the Director of the European Joint Undertaking for ITER and the Development of Fusion Energy discharge in respect of the
implementation of the Joint Undertaking's budget for the financial year 2012.
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of ITER for the financial year
2012 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Members made a number of recommendations that needed to be
taken into account when the discharge is granted, in addition to the general recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on
performance, financial management and control of EU agencies.
·

Financing, budget and financial management: Members noted that the budget of the Joint Undertaking for the financial year 2012
was initially adopted for the collective amount of EUR 503 million in commitment appropriations and that this amount was reduced
during the course of the year. They remarked that of the EUR 1 440 million in commitment appropriations available for operational
activities, 55.4 % was implemented through direct individual commitments in 2012, while the remainder, were globally committed for
large complex contracts requiring long negotiation times and with ensuing individual commitments in 2013. Members were also
concerned about the high cash balance, which amounted to nearly 14 % of the final available payment appropriations in 2012.

·

Rate of utilisation and carryovers: Members noted that after two amendments reducing the 2012 budget the utilisation rates for the
available commitment and payment appropriations were 99.9 % and 94.5%, respectively.

·

Objectives of the ITER programme: the committee recalled that in 2010, the Council revised the final cost figure of the Joint
Undertaking's contribution for the construction phase to EUR 6.6 billion (2008 value), thus doubling the initial estimate. It took note
that there were inconsistencies in pre-procurement activities for the ITER project pointing out that the Joint Undertaking was
exposed to significant financial risks linked to the evolution of commodity prices. The Joint Undertaking stressed that there was a risk
of cost deviations in the range of EUR 180-250 million, or 3 % of the latest estimated project cost of EUR 6.6 billion. Members took
note that in June 2013, the Joint Undertaking completed an exercise to update the cost estimate of the Union contribution to the
construction phase of the project that estimates the current risk of increase at EUR 290 million, or 4.4 % of the budget approved by
the Council, and that a significant escalation in the scope of the components to be provided to the ITER project was at the origin of
that estimated increase. They were also concerned that the Joint Undertaking considers the current ITER reference schedule to be

unrealistic, and they urged the Joint Undertaking to work with its ITER partners to establish a new and reliable schedule and to do its
utmost to ensure that the schedule is maintained while avoiding budget deviations.
Members went on to make a series of observations on procurement, internal control systems, internal audits, and horizontal aspects of
European Research Joint Undertakings. They invited the Court of Auditors to monitor the Joint Undertaking's policies as regards the
management and prevention of conflicts of interests by drafting a Special Report on the matter by the next discharge procedure.
JTI: the committee invited the Court of Auditors to comprehensively analyse the Joint Technology Initiatives (JTIs) and the other joint
undertakings in a separate report in light of the substantial amounts involved and the risks- notably reputational presented. It noted that the
Joint Undertakings total 2012 forecasted budgeted income amounted to some EUR 2.5 billion or about 1.8 % of the 2012 Union general
budget while approximately EUR 618 million came from the general budget (cash contribution from the Commission) and approximately EUR
134 million came from the industrial partners and members of the Joint Undertakings.
Members recalled that Parliament had previously requested that the Court of Auditors draw up a special report on the capacity of the joint
undertakings, together with their private partners, to ensure added value and efficient execution of Union research, technological development
and demonstration programmes.
They agreed with the Court of Auditors conclusion that the JTIs had been set up to support long-term industrial investment in particular
research areas, but noted that it had taken on average two years to grant financial autonomy to a JTI, with the Commission usually remaining
responsible for one third of the expected operational lifetime of the JTIs.

2013/2247(DEC) - 03/04/2014 Final act
PURPOSE: to grant discharge to the European Joint Undertaking for ITER in respect of the implementation of its budget for the financial year
2012.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision 2042/631/EU of the European Parliament on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of
the European Joint Undertaking for ITER and the Development of Fusion Energy for the financial year 2012.
CONTENT: with the present decision, the European Parliament grants discharge to the Director of the Joint Undertaking for ITER and the
Development of Fusion Energy in respect of the implementation of its budget for the financial year 2012.
This decision is in line with the European Parliament's resolution adopted on 3 April 2014 and comprises a series of observations that form an
integral part of the discharge decision (please refer to the summary of the opinion of 3 April 2014).
Amongst the main observations made, Parliament made a number of cross-cutting comments as regards all the Joint Undertakings (JUs) and
invited the Court of Auditors to conduct a detailed analysis of the JUs in a separate report in light of the substantial amounts involved and the
risks - notably reputational - presented.

2013/2247(DEC) - 03/04/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a decision concerning the discharge to be granted to the Director of the European Joint Undertaking for
ITER and the Development of Fusion Energy in respect of the implementation of the Centre's budget for the financial year 2012. The vote on
the discharge decision approved the closure of the accounts (in accordance with Annex VI, Article 5(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the
European Parliament.
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of ITER for the financial year
2012 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Parliament adopted by 426 votes to 111, with 19 abstentions, a
resolution containing a series of recommendations that form an integral part of the discharge decision and as well as the general
recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies.
These recommendations are summarised as follows:
Financing, budget and financial management: recalling that the members of the Joint Undertaking are Euratom, represented by the
Commission, the Member States of Euratom and other countries which have concluded cooperation agreements with Euratom in the
field of controlled nuclear fusion, Parliament noted that the budget of the Joint Undertaking for the financial year 2012 was initially
adopted for the collective amount of EUR 503 million in commitment appropriations and that this amount was reduced during the
course of the year. It remarked that of the EUR 1 440 million in commitment appropriations available for operational activities, 55.4 %
was implemented through direct individual commitments in 2012, while the remainder, were globally committed for large complex
contracts requiring long negotiation times and with ensuing individual commitments in 2013. Parliament was also concerned about the
high cash balance, which amounted to nearly 14 % of the final available payment appropriations in 2012.
Rate of utilisation and carryovers: Parliament noted that after two amendments reducing the 2012 budget the utilisation rates for the
available commitment and payment appropriations were 99.9 % and 94.5%, respectively.
Union contribution to the construction phase: Parliament recalled that in 2010, the Council revised the final cost figure of the Joint
Undertaking's contribution for the construction phase to EUR 6.6 billion (2008 value), thus doubling the initial estimate. It took note that

Parliament went on to make a series of observations on procurement, internal control systems, internal audits, and horizontal aspects of
European Research Joint Undertakings. It invited the Court of Auditors to monitor the Joint Undertaking's policies as regards the management
and prevention of conflicts of interests by drafting a Special Report on the matter by the next discharge procedure.
JTI: Parliament invited the Court of Auditors to comprehensively analyse the Joint Technology Initiatives (JTIs) and the other joint undertakings

Undertakings total 2012 forecasted budgeted income amounted to some EUR 2.5 billion or about 1.8 % of the 2012 Union general budget
while approximately EUR 618 million came from the general budget (cash contribution from the Commission) and approximately EUR 134
million came from the industrial partners and members of the Joint Undertakings. It also recalled that the total Union contribution deemed
necessary for the Joint Undertakings for their period of existence amounts to EUR 11.5 million.
It recalled that it had previously requested that the Court of Auditors draw up a special report on the capacity of the joint undertakings, together
with their private partners, to ensure added value and efficient execution of Union research, technological development and demonstration
programmes.
It agreed with the Court of Auditors conclusion that the JTIs had been set up to support long-term industrial investment in particular research
areas, but noted that it had taken on average two years to grant financial autonomy to a JTI, with the Commission usually remaining
