prepared on the basis of the information presented by the institutions, organisations and bodies of the EU, in accordance with Article 129 (2) of
the Financial Regulation applicable to the EU's General Budget, including the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT).
In 2012, the tasks and budget of this agency were as follows:
description of the EIT's tasks: the EIT, which is located in Budapest, was set up by Regulation (EC) No 294/2008 of the European
Parliament and of the Council. The Institutes objective is to contribute to sustainable European economic growth and competitiveness
by reinforcing the innovation capacity of the Member States and the European Union. The Institute shall: (i) raise awareness among
potential partner organisations and encourage their participation in its activities; (ii) select and designate Knowledge and Innovation
Communities (KICs) in the priority fields; (iii) mobilise funds from public and private sources to encourage the innovation process; (iv)
encourage the recognition in the Member States of degrees and diplomas which are awarded by higher education institutions that are
partner organisations,
EIT's budget for the 2012 financial year: the EITs budget for 2012, as presented in the Commission document on the consolidated
annual accounts of the European Union, gives the following figures:
§

Commitment appropriations :
- committed : EUR 97 million;

2013/2242(DEC) - 10/09/2013 Court of Auditors: opinion, report
PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology
(EIT) for the financial year 2012, together with the Institutes replies.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit concerned, amongst others, the annual accounts of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT).
In the Courts opinion, the Institutes annual accounts present fairly, in all material respects, its financial position as at 31 December 2012 and
the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions of its Financial Regulation and the
accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
However, it considers that the transactions underlying the annual accounts of the Institute for the financial year ended 31 December 2012 are
partly legal and regular in all material respects. It delivers a qualified opinion in this respect as regards the following operations: grants, final
payments and pre-financings (transactions) for an amount of EUR 11.3 million and EUR 48.6 million relating respectively to the activities in
2010 and 2011. The Court notes that about 80% of grant expenditure claimed by KICs is covered by certificates issued by independent audit
firms contracted by the KICs and their partners. However, it notes that the quality of the audit certificates is inadequate in many instances.
The Court could not obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence on the legality and regularity of the audited grant transactions related to 2010
activities.
The report confirms that the Institutes 2012 budget amounted to EUR 95.30 million in commitment appropriations and EUR 77.09 million in
payments.
The report also makes a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of the Institute, accompanied by the latters
response. The main observations may be summarised as follows:
Courts comments:
internal control: the Court noted that budgets for grant agreements signed in 2010 and 2011, which resulted in payments in 2012,
were not sufficiently specific. There was no link between the approved funds and the activities to be implemented;
budgetary management: out of the committed appropriations carried over from 2011 amounting to some EUR 22 million, some EUR
10 million (45%) were cancelled in 2012. The high level of cancellations is mainly due to lower than estimated costs claimed by
beneficiaries under 2011 grant agreements (EUR 9.2 million or 92% of cancelled carry-overs).
Institutes replies:
audits: EIT foresaw the need to reinforce the ex ante verification to mitigate the risks related to the first year of operation of the KICs.
In order to obtain reasonable assurance, EIT, beyond requesting audit certificates from the KICs, verified supporting documents
related to an important percentage of expenditure based on a random sample. As a result, ineligible costs were corrected before the
final payments. Any irregularities will be corrected and amounts unduly paid will be recovered in 2013;
budget management: although there is a high level of carry-overs from 2012 to 2013, significant progress is expected since
cancellations of carry-overs will be considerably reduced from 45 % (2011 carry-overs) to estimated 13 % (2012 carry- overs).
Lastly, the Court of Auditors report contains a summary of the Institutes activities in 2012. This is focused on the following:
establish regular dialogue between the Director of the Institute and the KIC CEOs;
manage a total budget of approximately EUR 90 million for EIT funding of KIC Value Added Activities and a budget of EUR 300 million
for non-EIT Funding of KAVA (kick added value) activities and complementary activities;
increase the number of KIC partners involved in the three KICs;
manage the European Union EIT Stakeholders Conference organised by the European Commission.

2013/2242(DEC) - 21/03/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Petri SARVAMAA (EPP, FI) in which it recommended the European Parliament to
grant discharge to the Director of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology in respect of the implementation of the Institute's budget
for the financial year 2012.
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the Institute for the financial
year 2012 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Members approved the closure of the Institutes accounts.
They made, however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is granted, in addition to the
general recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies.
Qualified opinion: Members regretted that the Court of Auditors found the quality of the audit certificates is inadequate in many
instances. They also deplored the fact that no ex post verifications have been carried out for transactions related to grants for 2010
activities (EUR 11.3 million). Furthermore, they deplored the fact that given the limited assurances that can be drawn from ex ante
verifications, there is no reasonable assurance as to the legality and regularity of these transactions . They noted that according to the
Court of Auditors, except for the possible effects of the matters described in the basis for a qualified opinion, the transactions
underlying the annual accounts for the year 2012 are legal and regular in all material respects.
Commitments and carryovers: Members noted that out of the committed appropriations carried over from 2011 amounting to some
EUR 22 million, some EUR 10 million (45%) were cancelled in 2012.
Members also made a series of observations on transfers, procurement and recruitment procedures as well as comments on internal controls.

They acknowledged that the Institute has two framework rules regulating conflicts of interests. They called on the Institute to inform the
discharge authority whether it intends to update those framework rules according to the Commission's Guidelines.

2013/2242(DEC) - 03/04/2014 Final act
PURPOSE: to grant discharge to the European Institute of Innovation and Technology for the financial year 2012.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision 2014/589/EU of the European Parliament on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of
the European Institute of Innovation and Technology for the financial year 2012.
CONTENT: with the present decision, the European Parliament grants discharge to the Director of the European Institute of Innovation and
Technology in respect of its budget for the financial year 2012. However, a certain number of reservations were made.
This decision is in line with the European Parliament's resolution adopted on 3 April 2014 and comprises a series of observations that form an
integral part of the discharge decision (please refer to the summary of the opinion of 3 April 2014).
Amongst the main observations made, Parliament expressed reservations about the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions. It
regretted in particular the lack of quality of audit certificates from the Institute and the weakness of some ex-post verifications of several of its
transactions.
