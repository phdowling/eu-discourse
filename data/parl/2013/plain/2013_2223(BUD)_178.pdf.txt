2013/2223(BUD) - 18/09/2013 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: to mobilise the Flexibility Instrument to complement the financing, in the 2014 EU budget, of the Cypriot Structural Funds
programmes.
PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
CONTENT: the future Council Regulation laying down the multiannual financial framework for the years 2014-2020 allows for the mobilisation
of the Flexibility Instrument to allow the financing of clearly identified expenditure which could not be financed within the limits of the ceilings
available for one or more headings of the multiannual financial framework.
In accordance with Article 11 of this Regulation, and after having examined all possibilities for re-allocating appropriations under heading 1b,
the Commission proposes to mobilise the Flexibility Instrument to complement the financing in the general budget of the European Union for
the financial year 2014, beyond the ceiling of heading 1b, of EUR 78 380 000 towards the financing of the Cypriot Structural Funds
programmes to grant an additional allocation from the Structural Funds to Cyprus.

2013/2223(BUD) - 14/11/2013 Budgetary report tabled for plenary, 1st reading
The Committee on Budgets adopted the report by Jean-Luc DEHAENE (EPP, BE) on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament
and of the Council on the mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument.
The report stated that after having examined all possibilities for re-allocating appropriations under heading 1b, it appears necessary to mobilise
the flexibility instrument to complement the financing in the general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2014 to finance the
Cypriot Structural Funds programmes.
Members noted that, despite contained reinforcements in commitments on a limited number of budget items and several decreases on other
budget items, the 2014 ceilings of subheading 1b in commitments do not allow for the adequate financing of important and urgent political
priorities of the Union carried by the Parliament and the Council.
Therefore, Members agreed with the mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument in commitments for the financing - under subheading 1b - of the
Cypriot Structural Funds programmes for a total amount of EUR 89.33 million (as opposed to EUR 78 million proposed by the Commission).
The mobilisation of this instrument highlights, once again, the crucial need for the Union budget to be increasingly flexible.
Members called on the European Parliament to approve the proposed decision annexed to this resolution.

2013/2223(BUD) - 20/11/2013 Final act
PURPOSE: to mobilise the Flexibility Instrument to complement the financing, in the 2014 EU budget, of the Cypriot Structural Funds
programmes.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision 2014/97/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on the mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument.
CONTENT: the Council Regulation laying down the multiannual financial framework for the years 2014-2020 allows for the mobilisation of the

Flexibility Instrument to allow the financing of clearly identified expenditure which could not be financed within the limits of the ceilings available
for one or more headings of the multiannual financial framework.
Having examined all possibilities for re-allocating appropriations, Parliament and Council decided to mobilise the flexibility instrument to
complement the financing in the general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2014, beyond the ceiling of heading 1b, of EUR
89 330 000 in commitment appropriations.
This amount will serve towards the financing of the Cypriot Structural Funds programmes to grant an additional allocation from the Structural
Funds to Cyprus for the year 2014 by a total amount of EUR 100 000 000.

2013/2223(BUD) - 20/11/2013 Budgetary text adopted by Parliament
The European Parliament adopted by 580 votes to 72, with 30 abstentions, a resolution on the proposal for a decision of the European
Parliament and of the Council on the mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument.
Parliament stated that after having examined all possibilities for re-allocating appropriations under heading 1b, it appears necessary to
mobilise the flexibility instrument to complement the financing in the general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2014 to
finance the Cypriot Structural Funds programmes.
