OJ L 354 28.12.2013, p. 0086 Summary

2013/0191(COD) - 13/06/2013 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to amend certain Regulations in the fields of fisheries and animal health by reason of the change of status of Mayotte with regard
to the Union.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: by Decision 2012/419/EU, the European Council amended the status of Mayotte with regard to the Union with effect from 1
January 2014. Therefore, from that date Mayotte will cease to be an overseas territory to become an outermost region within the meaning of
Articles 349 and 355(1) TFEU. Union law will apply to Mayotte from 1 January 2014.
This proposal follows the examination of requests made by the French authorities to have the Union acquis amended through specific
measures applicable to Mayotte in different areas, such as fisheries and animal health. The examination of the situation regarding Mayotte has
revealed that it is necessary to protect the sensitive biological situation of its waters. In certain respects, France needs additional time to
comply with the Union acquis with regard to Mayotte.
The amendments proposed all relate to Regulations in the fields of fisheries and animal health. In the interest of simplicity and speediness, it
has been considered expedient not to resort to individual proposals for each of the acts concerned but, where legally possible, to bundle the
amendments to several acts in a single proposal.
IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission did not undertake an impact assessment.
LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2) and Article 168(4)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
CONTENT: in view of the specific situation in Mayotte, the Commission is proposing amendments to certain Regulations in the fields of
fisheries and animal health.
In the area of fisheries, the proposed amendments aim to:
include the waters around Mayotte and to prohibit the use of purse-seines on tuna and tuna-like schools of fish inside the area within
24 miles from the baselines of the island in order to preserve the shoals of large migratory fish in the vicinity of the island of Mayotte;
grant additional time to France to to comply with the Union acquis with regard to Mayotte, in particular in regard to the registering and
control obligations in the area of fisheries, to the extent it concerns certain vessels dispersed around the island and not associated to a
specific landing site.
In the area of animal health, it is proposed to amend Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council in order to
grant France a transitional period of five years in regard to Mayotte, which would enable it to create the infrastructure necessary for the
identification, handling, transport, treatment and disposal of animal by-products.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no budgetary implications.

2013/0191(COD) - 07/10/2013 Supplementary legislative basic document
The Council adopted a proposed compromise text on the Council Regulation amending Regulations in the field of fisheries and animal health by reason
of the change of status of Mayotte with regard to the Union.
The proposed changes by the Presidency were as follows:
The proposal should be based on Article 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).

The Council should adopt this proposal having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament following the special legislative procedure.
It is stipulated that Mayotte should be considered as an outermost region within the meaning of Article 349 of the TFEU and that it is
appropriate to provide for certain specific measures justified by the particular structural social and economic situation of Mayotte which is
compounded by its remoteness, insularity, small size, difficult topography and climate, in a number of areas.
It has been proposed to amend the CMO Regulation - on the common organisation of the markets in fishery and aquaculture products to
provide for a temporary derogation from the rules concerning the labelling of fishery products offered for retail sale to the final consumer in
Mayotte until 31 December 2021.
Regulation of the Common Fisheries Policy should be amended in order to stipulate that France:
shall be authorised, until 31 December 2025, to introduce new capacity without the withdrawal of an equivalent capacity for the various
segments as referred to in Annex XX;
shall be exempted until 31 December 2021 from the obligation to include in its register of Union fishing vessels those vessels which
are less than 10 meters in overall length and operate from Mayotte;
until 31 December 2021, shall keep a provisional register of fishing vessels which are less than 10 meters in overall length and
operate from Mayotte. Vessels registered in the provisional register shall be considered to be vessels registered in Mayotte.
Lastly, animal by-products and derived products generated in Mayotte before 1 January 2021 shall be disposed of in accordance with the
Regulation.

2013/0191(COD) - 02/12/2013 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Fisheries adopted the report by João FERREIRA (GUE/NGL, PT) on the proposal for a regulation of the European
Parliament and of the Council amending certain Regulations in the field of fisheries and animal health by reason of the change of status of
Mayotte with regard to the Union.
The committee recommended that Parliaments position adopted in first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure should amend the
Commission proposal as follows:
Legal basis: Members proposed to add Article 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union as a legal basis, since Mayotte is
an outermost region.
Conservation of fisheries resources: as regards Council Regulation (EC) No 850/98 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical
measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organism, the report proposed:
·

to prohibit the use of purse-seines on tuna and tuna-like schools of fish inside the area within 24 nautical miles of the coasts of the
island of Mayotte, measured from the baselines from which territorial waters are measured;

·

to prohibit fishing under drifting fish aggregating devices (FADs) and under large marine mammals and whale sharks (natural FADs)
shall be prohibited in the whole of the Mayotte Marine Natural Park;

The Marine Natural Park of Mayotte is defined as the entire exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of Mayotte (68 381 km2). The land area of the
park shall extend to the upper foreshore, which marks the boundary of the maritime public domain.
Consumer information: with regard to the requirements concerning traceability and consumer information for products offered for retail sale,
the report proposed to extend to 31 December 2021 (instead of 16 December 2016) the deadline for implementing European legislation to give
Mayotte time to comply.
Register of fishing vessels: France shall be exempted until 31 December 2021 from the obligation to include in its register of Union fishing
vessels those vessels that are less than 10 meters in overall length and operate from Mayotte. The Commission had proposed that France be
exempted until 31 December 2016 for all vessels that are less than 9 meters in overall length.
Conservation measures: in the waters up to 100 nautical miles from the baselines of Mayotte and in the whole of the Mayotte Marine Natural
Park, France may adopt the conservation measures considered necessary for the preservation of the natural resources protected by the
legislation establishing that park.
Health rules : Members felt it necessary to see that Mayotte was given enough time to apply the health rules governing animal by-products and
derived products not intended for human consumption. The rules will apply from 1 January 2021 (rather than 1 January 2019.)
Control requirements : Members introduced a derogation from Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 to give Mayotte time to comply with the control
requirements provided for in this Regulation. By 1 January 2015, France shall establish a national scheme of control applicable to fishing
vessels which are less than 10 meters in overall length and operate from Mayotte.
By 30 September 2015 France shall present to the Commission an action plan setting out the measures to be taken in order to ensure the full
implementation of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 from 1 January 2018 concerning fishing vessels which are less than 10 meters in overall
length and operate from the outermost region of Mayotte.

2013/0191(COD) - 12/12/2013 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 553 votes to 56, with 13 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council amending certain Regulations in the field of fisheries and animal health by reason of the change of
status of Mayotte with regard to the Union.
The position at first reading adopted by the Parliament following the ordinary legislative procedure amended the Commission proposal as
follows:

Legal basis: Parliament proposed to add Article 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union as a legal basis, since Mayotte is
an outermost region. It is appropriate to provide for certain specific measures justified by the particular structural, social and economic situation

park shall extend to the upper foreshore, which marks the boundary of the maritime public domain.
Consumer information (Regulation (EC) No 104/2000): with regard to the requirements concerning traceability and consumer information for
products offered for retail sale, Parliament proposed to extend to 31 December 2021 the deadline for implementing European legislation to
give Mayotte time to comply.
Register of fishing vessels (Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002): France shall be exempted until 31 December 2021 from the obligation to include
in its register of Union fishing vessels those vessels that are less than 10 meters in overall length and operate from Mayotte. Until 31
December 2021, France shall keep a provisional register of fishing vessels which are less than 10 meters in overall length and operate from
Mayotte. That register shall contain, for each vessel, at least its name, its overall length and an identification code.
Conservation measures: in the waters up to 100 nautical miles from the baselines of Mayotte and in the whole of the Mayotte Marine Natural
Park, France may adopt the conservation measures considered necessary for the preservation of the natural resources protected by the
legislation establishing that park.
Health rules (Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009): Parliament felt it necessary to see that Mayotte was given enough time to apply the health rules
governing animal by-products and derived products not intended for human consumption. The rules will apply from 1 January 2021.
Control requirements: Members introduced a derogation from Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 to give Mayotte time to comply with the control
requirements provided for in this Regulation. By 1 January 2015, France shall establish a national scheme of control applicable to fishing
vessels which are less than 10 meters in overall length and operate from Mayotte.
By 30 September 2015, France shall present to the Commission an action plan setting out the measures to be taken in order to ensure the full
implementation of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 from 1 January 2018 concerning fishing vessels which are less than 10 meters in overall
length and operate from the outermost region of Mayotte.
