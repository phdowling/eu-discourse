2013/0802(CNS) - 08/03/2013 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to fix the period for the eighth election of representatives to the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to
follow its opinion.
BACKGROUND: in accordance with the Act concerning the election of the members of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage of
20 September 1976 ("Electoral Act"), the 2014 elections to the European Parliament should take place from 5 to 8 June 2014.
Nevertheless, the Electoral Act stipulates that if it proves impossible to hold the elections during that period, the Council acting unanimously
shall, after consulting the European Parliament, determine, at least one year before the end of the five-year term, another electoral period
which shall not be more than two months before or one month after the period normally applicable.
At the request of one delegation, the Working Party on General Affairs has discussed during several meetings the question of the dates of the
2014 elections to the European Parliament. Following those discussions, delegations have agreed, pending the consultation of the European
Parliament, to depart from the normally applicable dates and to hold the next European Parliament elections in the period from 22 to 25 May
2014.
CONTENT: the draft Council Decision fixes the period for the eighth election of representatives to the European Parliament by direct universal
suffrage from 22 to 25 May 2014.

2013/0802(CNS) - 17/04/2013 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Constitutional Affairs adopted the report by Carlo CASINI (EPP, IT) on the draft Council decision fixing the period for the
eighth election of representatives to the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage.
To recall, this report was drawn up in response to a request for consultation from the Council on a draft decision seeking to modify the period
during which the forthcoming European elections would ordinarily have been held. Under Article 11(2) of the Act concerning the election of the
members of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage (the Electoral Act), this period would have been Thursday 5 to Sunday 8
June 2014, by analogy with the dates on which the first elections by direct universal suffrage were held (Thursday 9 to Sunday 12 June 1979).
Given that, in most Member States, the dates on which the elections would ordinarily have been held would have coincided with the Whitsun
bank holiday weekend, the Council took the view that it would be preferable to bring them forward, and proposed that the electoral period
should run between Thursday 22 and Sunday 25 May 2014.

2013/0802(CNS) - 21/05/2013 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading

The European Parliament adopted by 601 votes to 31, with 16 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the draft Council decision fixing the
period for the eighth election of representatives to the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage.
Parliament approved the Council draft which brings forward the dates of the next European elections from 5-8 June to 22-25 May 2014.

2013/0802(CNS) - 14/06/2013 Final act

LEGISLATIVE ACT: Council Decision 2013/299/EU, Euratom fixing the period for the eighth election of representatives to the European
Parliament by direct universal suffrage.
CONTENT: by this Decision, the eighth election of the representatives of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage shall be from 22
to 25 May 2014.
