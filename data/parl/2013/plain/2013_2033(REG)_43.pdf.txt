Summary

2013/2033(REG) - 22/01/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Constitutional Affairs adopted the report by Gerald HÄFNER (Greens/EFA, DE) on amendment of Rule 136 of Parliament's
Rules of Procedure on the attendance of Members at sittings.
This amendment is solely aimed at reducing the negative impact on members' attendance record and the resulting "parliamentary activity
indicators" on websites such as Vote Watch in those well justified cases.
Rule 136(2) should be amended to state that the names of the Members present, as shown in the attendance register, shall be recorded in the
minutes of each sitting as "present". The names of the Members excused by the President shall be recorded in the minutes of each sitting as
"excused".

2013/2033(REG) - 25/02/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament decided to amend Rule 136 of Parliament's Rules of Procedure on the attendance of Members at sittings.
Rule 136, paragraph 2, as amended reads as: The names of the Members present, as shown in the attendance register, shall be recorded in
the minutes of each sitting as present. The names of the Members excused by the President shall be recorded in the minutes of each sitting
as excused.
