Examination of delegated act

2013/0139(COD) - 08/05/2013 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to improve and develop the single market for retail banking.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: the lack of transparency and comparability of charges and the difficulty of switching bank accounts continue to figure as
obstacles to a fully integrated internal market for retail banking.
A survey conducted by Eurobarometer in 2012 showed that only 3% of the respondents declared having opened a payment account
cross-border.
Consumers were dissuaded from purchasing retail financial products cross-border by unclear information (21%), lack of clarity of the rights
available to the consumer (18%) or the process being too complicated (15%).
Surveys and complaints from consumers demonstrate that many citizens have faced difficulties in opening a payment account due to their lack
of a permanent address in the Member State where the payment service provider is located. This problem affects a large number of EU
consumers living in another Member State (12.3 million people in 2010).
Furthermore, the World Bank estimated that about 58 million EU consumers do not have a payment account and approximately 25 million of
them would like to open one.
The fact that a large number of consumers does not currently participate in the internal market for financial services has negative
consequences for both payment service providers and consumers.
Initiatives have already been taken in these areas: (i) the Payment Service Directive (2007/64/EC) provides certain transparency obligations
with respect to the fees charged by payment service providers; (ii) following a request from the Commission in 2010, the banking industry at
EU level proposed to develop, through self-regulation, a framework ensuring increased transparency on payment account fees; (iii) in July
2011 the Commission issued a Recommendation on access to a basic payment account.
However, progress remains limited.
The Single Market Act II adopted on 3 October 2012, identified a legislative initiative on bank accounts in the EU as one of the twelve priority
actions to generate real effects on the ground and make citizens and businesses confident to use the single market to their advantage.
IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission prepared an impact assessment of policy options. These options concerned: (i) the scope of the
new provisions, (ii) the level of standardisation, (iii) the setting up and functioning of measures on transparency and comparability of fees,
switching between payment accounts, improved access to basic payment services and (iv) how to ensure their effective application for
consumers.
Following an assessment of the available options, the Commission concluded that in order to improve the functioning of the switching process,
it is necessary to enact measures to give binding legal force to the provisions of the Common Principles on account switching.
LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.
CONTENT: the draft directive aims to: (i) improve the transparency and comparability of fee information relating to payment accounts, (ii)
facilitate switching between payment accounts, (iii) eliminate discrimination based on residency with respect to payment accounts and (iv)
provide access to a payment account with basic features within the EU.
The directive will apply to payment accounts held by consumers. Consequently, accounts held by businesses are outside its scope. It will not
cover savings accounts.

1) Transparency on fees: the proposal requires payment service providers to provide consumers with:
·

a fee information document containing information on the most representative payment services in each Member State, using the
terms and definitions established at EU level where relevant;

·

a glossary drafted in clear, unambiguous and non-technical language, containing at least the list of payment services and the related
definitions;

·

information on all the fees charged on the account at least annually.

Consumers should be able to access comparison websites obtain to obtain impartial information on bank fees.
2) Changing accounts: the proposal:
·

requires Member States enact a general obligation for payment service providers to make a switching service available to any
consumer who holds an account with a payment service provider located in the Union;

·

establishes the specific roles and obligations for the receiving and transferring payment service providers in the context of the
switching service;

·

establishes principles to guarantee that the charges related to the switching services are appropriate and in line with the costs
incurred;

·

establishes the obligation for payment service providers to refund charges incurred by consumers due to their mistake or delay
during the switching service.

3) Access to a bank account: the proposal:
·

requires Member States to ensure that consumers are not discriminated against on the basis of their nationality or residence when
applying for a payment account or in their use of a payment account;

·

establishes a right of access to a basic payment account for consumers in any Member State;

·

requires Member States to designate at least one payment service provider to offer a basic payment account;

·

requires Member States to ensure that services are offered by payment service providers free of charge or for a reasonable fee.

·

recalls that Directive 2007/64/EC is applicable to payment accounts with basic features. However the proposal provides for a limited
list of grounds that may justify the termination of the framework contract of a payment account with basic features by the payment
service provider.

Lastly, the proposal requires Member States: (i) to establish specific requirements for the settlement of disputes between consumers and
payment service providers; (ii) to establish rules on sanctions for breaches of the national provisions adopted to implement the directive.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget.
DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of
the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

2013/0139(COD) - 19/11/2013 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs adopted the report by J|rgen KLUTE (GUE/NGL, DE) on the proposal for a directive of the
European Parliament and of the Council on the comparability of fees related to payment accounts, payment account switching and access to
payment accounts with basic features.
The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, took up its right as an associated committee in line with Article 50 of the
European Parliament Rules of Procedure, to be equally consulted and to give an opinion on the present report.
The parliamentary committee recommended that the position of the European Parliament adopted at first reading, following the ordinary
legislative procedure, amend the Commission proposal.
Fee information document: payment service providers should provide consumers with a comprehensive fee information document that states
the fees for all services before concluding a contract linked to the payment account.
The fee information document should: i) state the fees for all services linked to the payment account contained in the list of the most
representative services; ii) mention any further fees that can be applied to the account; iii) display a common symbol on the first page, making
it clearly distinguishable from sales or contractual communications. The consumers must be informed of any change in fees.
The document should be accessible at all times and be published by providers in an electronic format on their website, including for persons
who are not clients.
In addition, providers should provide consumers, free of charge, with a statement of all fees and the interest rates applied to their payment
account on an annual basis.
The Commission will have the power to adopt delegated acts relating to a standardised terminology at EU level for payment services common
to a majority at least of Member States. In each Member State language a single term will be used for each service.
Comparison websites at national level: the Committee proposed that an independent and free website shall be established in each Member
State allowing comparison of fees charged and interest paid by banks, as well as their level of service.
By three years after the entry into force of this Directive, the European Banking Authority (EBA) shall provide a publicly accessible Union
comparison website that enables consumers to compare payment accounts offered within the internal market.
Switching accounts: clients should be able to switch banks within the EU at reasonable costs.

The costs incurred by a customer during a change of bank due to a payment service providers failure to fulfil its obligations must be
reimbursed within three days from the establishment of non-compliance.
If the Commission does not decide otherwise after a regulatory impact assessment, Member States should ensure, at the latest six years after
the entry into force of the directive, that a system be put in place to allow the automated redirection of payments from one account to another
within the same Member State.
Access to a basic account: holding a basic payment account shall be in no way discriminatory.
Member States shall ensure that a payment account with basic features is offered to consumers by all payment service providers that operate
in general retail payment services.
This right should apply regardless of the place of residence of the consumer and the exercise of the right should not be made excessively
difficult or binding on the customer.
The banks must process applications for access to a payment account with basic features within seven business days of receiving a complete
application including proof of identity.
Member States must also guarantee that a mechanism is in place:
to assist consumers with no fixed address, asylum seekers and consumers who are not granted a residence permit but whose
expulsion is impossible for legal reasons to meet the requirements of Chapter II of Directive 2005/60/EC;
to ensure that unbanked, vulnerable consumers as well as mobile consumers are informed about the availability of payment accounts
with basic features.
To open and use a payment account with basic features consumers shall be required to have a genuine link to the Member State where they
wish to open an account.That link shall include at least citizenship, family ties, centre of interests, place of work, internship or apprenticeship,
pursuit of job opportunities or other professional links, place of study or vocational training, residence, property and any outstanding asylum or
migration application.
Payment accounts with basic features shall not include any overdraft facilities other than a temporary buffer facility for small amounts.
Payment service providers may offer overdraft facilities and other credit products as clearly separated services.
General information on basic accounts: the Committee requested that Member States:
require educational establishments to develop services for the most vulnerable customers providing them with guidance and
assistance in the responsible management of their finances. encourage financial education, including at schools;
ensure that the competent authorities publish, including on their website, an audit of the performance of each payment service
provider in terms of its compliance with the right of access requirement.
Alternative dispute resolution: the report suggests that Member States establish adequate and effective out-of-court complaint and redress
procedures for the settlement of disputes between consumers and payment service providers concerning rights and obligations established
under this Directive. For those purposes, Member States shall designate existing bodies and, where appropriate, set up new bodies.

2013/0139(COD) - 19/11/2013 European Central Bank: opinion, guideline, report
OPINION OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK
The ECB strongly supports the proposed directive, which should give consumers easier access to payment accounts and contribute to the
creation of a Union-wide payment area, a goal that the ECB has consistently supported.
The ECB made a series of specific observations on the following points:
Definitions: the terms defined in the proposed directive should be aligned with those of Directive 2007/64/EC (the Payment Services Directive
(PSD)) and Regulation (EU) No 260/2012 (the SEPA Regulation), unless there are objective reasons for departing from such defined terms.
This concerns in particular the definitions of the terms durable medium and direct debit.
List of covered services and powers of the authorities to obtain information
·

The list of basic payment services covered by the proposed directive should reflect payment services accounting for at least 80 % of
the most representative payment services subject to a fee at national level. However, more far-reaching conditions, mandating a
certain number of services on such a list, may prove excessive.

·

Moreover, it should be clarified that the competent authorities are entitled to obtain information from payment service providers on
the profitability of individual services provided in connection with payment accounts for the purpose of compiling the list of the most
representative payment services. Specific reporting obligations may need to be established for this purpose, which should at the
same time ensure the right of payment service providers to protect business secrets from their competitors.

Right to open a payment account with basic features: the proposed directives wording might be understood to imply that payment service
providers may be required on request to open a payment account with basic features denominated in any Member State currency. Given that
the implementation of such a broad requirement may not be economically viable, it suffices to limit this right to open and use a payment
account to payment accounts in the currency of the Member State where the payment service provider is located.
Cross-border cooperation: the ECB considers that the proposed obligation on the competent national authorities within a Member State to
cooperate to ensure effective compliance with the proposed directive should be expanded to include an obligation on competent authorities
from different Member States to cooperate on a cross-border basis.

2013/0139(COD) - 12/12/2013 Text adopted by Parliament, partial vote at 1st reading/single

reading
The European Parliament adopted amendments to the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the
comparability of fees related to payment accounts, payment account switching and access to payment accounts with basic features.
The matter was referred back to the competent committee for re-consideration. The vote on the legislative resolution was moved to a later
plenary session.
The main amendments were as follows:
Fee information document: in order to help consumers compare payment account fees throughout the internal market easily, payment service
providers should provide consumers with a comprehensive fee information document that states the fees for all services linked to the payment
account contained in the list of the most representative services and any further fees that can be applied to the account. The fee information
document should use the standardised terms and definitions established at Union level, where possible
The document should be accessible at all times and be published by providers in an electronic format on their website, including for persons
who are not clients.
Payment service providers must make available to consumers a glossary of all services linked to the account and the related definitions and
explanations.
The glossary must be drafted in clear, unambiguous and non-technical language that it is not misleading.
Furthermore, banks should provide consumers, free of charge, with a statement of all fees and the interest rates applied to their payment
account on an annual basis.
The Commission will have the power to adopt delegated acts relating to a standardised terminology at EU level for payment services common
to a majority at least of Member States. In each Member State language a single term will be used for each service.
Comparison websites at national level: Parliament proposed that an independent and free website shall be established in each Member State
allowing comparison of fees charged and interest paid by banks, as well as their level of service.
By three years after the entry into force of this Directive, the European Banking Authority (EBA) shall provide a publicly accessible Union
comparison website that enables consumers to compare payment accounts offered within the internal market.
Switching accounts: clients should be able to switch banks within the EU at reasonable costs.
The costs incurred by a customer during a change of bank due to a payment service providers failure to fulfil its obligations must be
reimbursed within three days from the establishment of non-compliance.
If the Commission does not decide otherwise after a regulatory impact assessment, Member States should ensure, at the latest six years after
the entry into force of the directive, that a system be put in place to allow the automated redirection of payments from one account to another
within the same Member State.
Access to a basic account: holding a basic payment account shall be in no way discriminatory. Making any discrimination visible through, for
example, a different appearance of the card, a different account or card number, shall be prohibited.
Member States shall ensure that a payment account with basic features is offered to consumers by all payment service providers that operate
in general retail payment services.
This right should apply regardless of the place of residence of the consumer and the exercise of the right should not be made excessively
difficult or binding on the customer.
An amendment adopted in plenary stipulates that a Member State may decide to exempt payment service providers from this obligation
subject to the approval of the Commission and on objective and restrictive criteria. The Commission shall approve the exemptions where: (i) a
level playing field among all payment service providers is guaranteed, (ii) the right of access for consumers is not undermined and (iii) the
exemption does not lead to a situation in the Member State concerned where basic account customers face the risk of being stigmatised.
The banks must process applications for access to a payment account with basic features within seven business days of receiving a complete
application including proof of identity.
Member States must also guarantee that a mechanism is in place:
·

to assist consumers with no fixed address, asylum seekers and consumers who are not granted a residence permit but whose
expulsion is impossible for legal reasons to meet the requirements of Chapter II of Directive 2005/60/EC;

·

to ensure that unbanked, vulnerable consumers as well as mobile consumers are informed about the availability of payment
accounts with basic features.

To open and use a payment account with basic features consumers shall be required to have a genuine link to the Member State where they
wish to open an account. That link shall include at least citizenship, family ties, centre of interests, place of work, internship or apprenticeship,
pursuit of job opportunities or other professional links, place of study or vocational training, residence, property and any outstanding asylum or
migration application.
Payment accounts with basic features shall not include any overdraft facilities other than a temporary buffer facility for small amounts.
Payment service providers may offer overdraft facilities and other credit products as clearly separated services.
General information on basic accounts: Parliament requested that Member States:
·

require educational establishments to develop services for the most vulnerable customers providing them with guidance and
assistance in the responsible management of their finances; encourage financial education, including at schools;

·

ensure that the competent authorities publish, including on their website, an audit of the performance of each payment service
provider in terms of its compliance with the right of access requirement.

Alternative dispute resolution: Parliament suggests that Member States establish adequate and effective out-of-court complaint and redress
procedures for the settlement of disputes between consumers and payment service providers concerning rights and obligations established
under this Directive. For those purposes, Member States shall designate existing bodies and, where appropriate, set up new bodies.

2013/0139(COD) - 15/04/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 603 votes to 21, with 51 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a directive of the
European Parliament and of the Council on the comparability of fees related to payment accounts, payment account switching and access to
payment accounts with basic features.
The report was referred back to the competent committee at the plenary session of 12 December 2013. Parliament adopted its position at first
reading following the ordinary legislative procedure. The amendments adopted in plenary are the result of a negotiated agreement between
the European Parliament and the Council. They amend the proposal as follows:
Purpose: the directive would set i) rules concerning the transparency and comparability of fees charged to consumers on their payment
accounts held within the European Union; ii) rules concerning the switching of payment accounts within a Member State; and iii) assistance for
consumers about cross-border opening of payment accounts. The directive will apply to accounts allowing consumers to make deposits,
withdraw funds and make payment transactions, including transfers.
Fee information document: in order to help consumers compare payment account fees throughout the internal market easily, payment service
providers should provide consumers with a comprehensive fee information document that states the fees for all services linked to the payment
account contained in the list of the most representative services and any further fees that can be applied to the account. The fee information
document should use the standardised terms and definitions established at Union level, where possible.
The fee information document should be easy to read and carry a common symbol. It should be clear and unambiguous using the currency of
the payment account, and worded in the official language of the Member State in which the account is proposed. The document should be
accessible at all times, including for persons who are not clients.
Payment service providers must make available to consumers a glossary of all services linked to the account providing clear, non-technical
and unambiguous explanations for at least the services linked to the payment account and the related definitions and explanations. The
glossary must be drafted in clear, unambiguous and non-technical language that it is not misleading.
In addition, banks should provide consumers, free of charge, with a statement of all fees and the interest rates applied to their payment
account on an annual basis.
The fee terminology should be determined by the Member States. In order to ensure a sufficient homogeneity of the national lists, the
European Banking Authority (EBA) should establish guidelines to assist Member States to determine the services which are most commonly
used and cause the highest cost to consumers at national level.
Comparison websites: consumers should have free access to at least one independent website allowing comparison of fees charged by banks
for their most representative levels of service.
Switching accounts: to qualify for the best offers, customers should be able to opt, at reasonable cost, for another basic account within the EU.
The switch from one bank account to another without change of currency or country should be supported by the recipient bank, at the request
of the authoriser and with his authorisation.
The authorisation should allow the consumer to specify the incoming transfers, standing orders and direct debits to be transferred. The
recipient bank should within two working days of receiving the clients authorisation, request the transfer service provider to carry out the
authorised tasks.
Banks would be required to reimburse the client, as soon as possible, for any financial loss (including costs and interest) directly resulting from
errors in the process of changing the account. When a client instructs his bank that he wishes to open an account in another Member State,
the bank with which he holds an account should provide assistance on receiving his request.
Access to a basic payment account: in line with Parliaments wishes, the Member States should ensure that a basic payment account is offered
to consumers by all payment service providers or in sufficient numbers to guarantee access to such an account for all consumers in the
Member State concerned.
The conditions applicable to holding a basic payment account should be in no way discriminatory. All persons legally resident in the EU
including clients without a fixed address or residence permit could open a basic account. However, Member States may, so long as
fundamental rights are respected, require potential clients to explain their reason for opening such a bank account in the particular country, so
long as the process is not excessively difficult or binding.
The application for access to a basic payment account should be rejected without delay and no later than ten working days from receiving the
completed application. In any case, it would be turned down if the opening of an account involved infringing the provisions on the prevention of
money laundering or the fight against terrorism.
Characteristics of a payment account with basic features: the basic account would allow clients:
·

services enabling all the operations required for the opening, operating and closing of a payment account;

·

services enabling money to be placed on a payment account

·

to withdraw cash withdrawals within the Union from a payment account at the bank counter and at automated teller machines during
or outside the bank's opening hours;

·

execution of the following within the Union: i) direct debits; ii) payment transactions by way of payment card including online
payments; iii) credit transfers, including standing orders, at terminals, counters and via the online facilities of the payment service
provider.

The clients may carry out an unlimited number of operations, either free of charge or at a reasonable price.
When they allow credit institution to provide, at the request of the customer, an overdraft facility linked to a basic account, Member States
would have the option to set a maximum amount or duration for this overdraft.
Lastly, Member States should ensure that communication measures are sufficient and well targeted, in particular reaching out to unbanked,
vulnerable and mobile consumers.

2013/0139(COD) - 23/07/2014 Final act
PURPOSE: to ensure access to basic payment accounts and improve the availability of information on fees related to payment accounts.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Directive 2014/92/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on the comparability of fees related to payment
accounts, payment account switching and access to payment accounts with basic features.
CONTENT: the Directive lays down : (i) rules concerning the transparency and comparability of fees charged to consumers on their payment
accounts held within the Union, (ii) rules concerning the switching of payment accounts within a Member State and (iii) rules to facilitate
cross-border payment account-opening for consumers.
The Directive also defines a framework for the rules and conditions according to which Member States are required to guarantee a right for
consumers to open and use payment accounts with basic features in the Union.
In its resolution of 4 July 2012, with recommendations to the Commission, the European Parliament said that more must be done to improve
and develop the internal market for retail banking.
The main points of the Directive are as follows:
Comparability of payment account fees: in order to help consumers compare payment account fees throughout the internal market easily,
banks should provide consumers with:
·

a fee information document that states the fees for all services linked to the payment account contained in the list of the most
representative services linked to a payment account and subject to a fee at national level. The document should where applicable
use the standardised terms and definitions established at Union level. It should: (i) be a short and stand-alone document; (ii) be
presented and laid out in a way that is clear and easy to read, using characters of a readable size; (iii) be written in the official
language of the Member State where the payment account is offered. The following must be provided in an easily accessible
manner, including to non-customers:

·

a glossary of at least the standardised terms set out in the final list of the most representative services and the related definitions.
The glossary must be drafted in clear, unambiguous and non-technical language;

·

a statement of all fees and the interest rates applied to their payment account on an annual basis.

·

free access to at least one independent website allowing comparison of fees charged by banks for their most representative levels of
service.

Switching accounts in a Member State: payment service providers must provide a switching service between payment accounts held in the
same currency to any consumer who opens or holds a payment account with a payment service provider located in the territory of the Member
State concerned.
The switch from one bank account to another without change of currency or country should be supported by the recipient bank, at the request
of the authoriser and with his authorisation.
The authorisation should allow the consumer to: (i) specify the incoming transfers, standing orders and direct debits to be transferred; (ii)
specify the date from which standing orders for credit transfers and direct debits are to be executed from the payment account opened or held
with the receiving payment service provider. That date shall be at least six business days after the date on which the receiving payment
service provider receives the documents transferred from the transferring payment service provider.
The recipient bank should within two working days of receiving the clients authorisation, request the transfer service provider to carry out the
authorised tasks.
Fees connected with the switching service must be reasonable. The banks must reimburse the customer without delay for any financial loss,
including charges and interest, resulting directly from mistakes in the switching process.
When a client instructs his bank that he wishes to open an account in another Member State, the bank with which he holds an account should
provide assistance on receiving his request.
Access to a basic payment account: the Directive ensures that credit institutions do not discriminate against consumers legally resident in the
Union by reason of their nationality or place of residence.
Specifically, consumers legally resident in the Union, including consumers with no fixed address and asylum seekers, and consumers who are
not granted a residence permit but whose expulsion is impossible for legal or factual reasons, will have the right to open and use a payment
account with basic features with credit institutions located in their territory. consumers should show a genuine interest in opening an account,
but this requirement must not be made too difficult or burdensome for the consumer.
The application for access to a basic payment account should be rejected without delay and no later than ten working days from receiving the
