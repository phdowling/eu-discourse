Summary

2013/2928(DEA) - 11/12/2013 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament declared that it has no objections to the Commission delegated regulation of 30 October 2013 on the conditions for
making a declaration of performance on construction products available on a website.
To recall, Regulation (EC) No 305/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down harmonised conditions for the marketing of
construction products.
Parliament consider that it is important to ensure that the delegated regulation on e-supply enters into force as soon as possible, given that the
substantial provisions of the basic legislative act, including those on providing declarations of performance, apply from 1 July 2013. The
possibility to make these declarations available on the internet would, in accordance with the wish of the legislator, allow the manufacturers of
construction products to reduce costs and also increase the flexibility of the construction sector as such.
Parliament recalled that: (i) it is of utmost importance that both Parliament and the Council can exercise their rights as co-legislators as defined
in the Treaties, including the decision as to which elements are to be delegated to the Commission in future basic legislative acts, and that; (ii)
it is able to take part in consultations alongside Member States experts and other stakeholders prior to the adoption of a delegated act and in
a transparent manner.
