OJ L 353 28.12.2013, p. 0013 Summary

2013/0387(CNS) - 12/11/2013 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to extend the period of application of Decision 2002/546/EC.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to
follow its opinion.
BACKGROUND: Council Decision 2002/546/EC authorises Spain, up to 31 December 2011, to apply exemptions from or reductions in the
Arbitrio sobre Importaciones y Entregas de Mercancías en las Islas Canarias (AIEM) to certain products produced locally in the Canary
Islands. Council Decision 895/2011/EU amended Decision 2002/546/EC, extending its period of application up to 31 December 2013.
The exemptions from and reductions in the AIEM establish differentiated taxation, benefiting the local production of some products. This
constitutes state aid that requires the approval of the Commission.
On 28 June 2013 the Commission has adopted its Guidelines on regional State aid for 2014-2020. Given that these Guidelines will enter into
force on 1 July 2014, the Commission considers it necessary to extend the period of application of Decision 2002/546/EC, as amended by
Decision 895/2011/EU, for six months, so that its expiry date coincides with the date of entry into force of the Guidelines.
IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken.
LEGAL BASIS: Article 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
CONTENT: the proposal seeks to extend to 30 June 2014 the period of application of Decision 2002/546/EC (as amended by Decision
895/2011/EU) for six months, so that its expiry date coincides with the date of entry into force of the Guidelines on regional State aid for
2014-2020.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no impact on the budget of the European Union.

2013/0387(CNS) - 05/12/2013 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
By adopting the report by Danuta Maria HÜBNER (EPP, PL) in the framework of a special legislative procedure (European Parliament
consultation), the Committee on Regional Development approved, without amendment, the proposal for a Council decision amending Decision

2002/546/EC as regards its period of application.
Given that this proposed measure is intended at continuing to stimulate economic activity and stabilising employment in this outermost region,
and that the extension is proposed for a limited period of time, the report suggested that this proposal be adopted without amendment.

2013/0387(CNS) - 11/12/2013 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 537 votes to 41, with 5 abstentions, in the framework of a special legislative procedure (European
Parliament consultation), a legislative resolution on the proposal for a Council decision amending Decision 2002/546/EC as regards its period
of application.
Following its Committee on Regional Development, Parliament approved the Commission proposal without amendment.

2013/0387(CNS) - 17/12/2013 Final act
PURPOSE: to extend the period of application of Decision 2002/546/EC for six months.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Council Decision No 1413/2013/EU amending Decision 2002/546/EC as regards its period of application.
CONTENT: Council Decision 2002/546/EC authorises Spain to apply exemptions from, or reductions in, the tax known as Arbitrio sobre
Importaciones y Entregas de Mercancías en las Islas Canarias (AIEM) to certain products produced in the Canary Islands. The Annex to that
Decision contains a list of products to which tax exemptions and reductions may be applied.
The exemptions from, and reductions in, the AIEM establish differentiated taxation, benefiting the local production of some products. This
constitutes state aid that requires the approval of the Commission.
Council Decision 2002/546/EC was originally applicable until 31 December 2011. At the end of 2011, Council Decision 895/2011/EU amended
Decision 2002/546/EC, extending its period of application until 31 December 2013.
On 28 June 2013, the Commission adopted its Guidelines on regional state aid for 2014-2020. These Guidelines, which will enter into force on
1 July 2014.
Since the structural, social and economic situation in the Canary Islands is still in place, this Decision extends the period of application of
Decision 2002/546/EC for six months, until 30 June 2014 so that its expiry date coincides with the date of entry into force of the Guidelines on
regional state aid for 20142020.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 17.12.2013.
