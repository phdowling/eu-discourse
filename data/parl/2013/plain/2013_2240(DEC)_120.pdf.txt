In 2012, the tasks and budget of this agency were as follows:

Parliament and of the Council with a view to helping the Member States regulatory authorities in the areas of electricity and natural

2013/2240(DEC) - 10/09/2013 Court of Auditors: opinion, report

PURPOSE : presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the
Agency for Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) for the year 2012, together with the Agencys reply.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit concerned, amongst others, the annual accounts of the Agency for Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER).
In the Courts opinion, ACERs Annual Accounts fairly present, in all material respects, its financial position as of 31 December 2012 and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions of its Financial Regulation and the
accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
The Court also considers that the transactions underlying the annual accounts of the Agency for the financial year ended 31 December 2012
are, in all material respects, legal and regular.
The report confirms that the Agencys 2012 budget amounted to EUR 4.8 million.
The report also makes a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of the Agency, accompanied by the latters
response. The main observations may be summarised as follows:
The Courts observations:
·

carried-over commitments: the Agency carried over committed appropriations (Agencys building and associated costs) amounting to
EUR 1.7 million, representing 81 % of total committed title II appropriations. The Agency also made 20 budget transfers of some
EUR 1 million euro and affecting 43 budget lines;

·

recruitment: the audited recruitment procedures revealed shortcomings affecting transparency and equal treatment of candidates.

The Authoritys reply:
·

the EUR 4.2 million cash balance held in the Agencys bank account at year-end included the 2011 budgetary surplus of EUR 1.6 m
paid back in January 2013, as the Agency received the request from the Commission only on 8 January 2013. The Agencys cash
management aims to ensure that funds are available to cover outstanding liabilities as they occur ;

·

the Agency is strictly following the interview and written test procedures as established in detail in the relevant Director decision
2012-17 on Guidelines on recruitment procedures and work of the Selection Committees on 20 March 2012, ensuring questions and
assessment criteria are fixed before the start of the testing and interviews. In order to take account of the auditors comments the
Agency agrees to revise the current procedure.

Lastly, the Court of Auditors report contains a summary of the Authoritys activities in 2012. This is focused on the following:
opinions and framework guidelines, inter alia, on electricity ;
reasoned opinions and recommendations on network codes ;
joint report on market surveillance ;
quarterly reports on regional initiatives on electricity ;
two new Agency Working Groups established (implementation, monitoring and procedures Working Group and a market integrity and
transparency Working Group), and the Rules for the functioning of the Working Groups were updated.

2013/2240(DEC) - 20/03/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Petri SARVAMAA (EPP, FI) in which it recommended the European Parliament to
grant discharge to the Director of the European Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators discharge in respect of the implementation
of the Agencys budget for the financial year 2012.
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the Agency for the financial
year 2012 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Members approved the closure of the Agencys accounts.
They made, however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is granted, in addition to the
general recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies.
Legality and regularity: Members noted with concern that in order to cover higher school fees, the Agency grants staff whose children
attend primary or secondary school a top-up allowance which amounted to some EUR 23 000 in 2012, in addition to the education
allowances provided for in the Staff Regulations. For Members, these allowances are not covered by the Staff Regulations and are,
therefore, considered irregular even though they acknowledge that this situation is due to the lack of European Schools in the city
where the Agency is based.
Budget and financial management: Members noted that budget monitoring efforts during the financial year 2012 resulted in a budget
implementation rate of 93.75% and that the payment appropriations execution rate was 66.8%. They regretted that the Agency carried
over committed appropriations amounting to EUR 1.7 million, representing 81% of total committed appropriations relating mainly to the
implementation of the REMIT regulation. They noted with concern that the Agency held EUR 4.2 million in cash at the end of the year,
including the 2011 budget surplus of EUR 1.6 million resulting from an excessive call for funds in 2011. Members called on the Agency
to report on its progress within the framework of the 2012 discharge follow-up.
Members also made a series of observations on transfers, procurement and recruitment procedures as well as comments on internal controls.
Lastly, they acknowledged that the Agency is reviewing its policy on the prevention and management of conflicts of interests on the basis of
the Commission's Guidelines on the Prevention and Management of Conflict of Interest in EU Decentralised Agencies. They called on the
Agency to inform the discharge authority of the assessment results once available.

2013/2240(DEC) - 03/04/2014 Final act
PURPOSE: to grant discharge to the European Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) for the financial year 2012.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision 2014/561/EU of the European Parliament on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of

of Energy Regulators in respect of its budget for the financial year 2012.

integral part of the discharge decision (please refer to the summary of the opinion of 3 April 2014).

transactions (unauthorised school fees) and called on it to remedy the situation.

2013/2240(DEC) - 03/04/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
