Summary

The European Parliament adopted by 64 votes to zero, with one abstention, a resolution on Iraq: the plight of minority groups, including the
Iraqi Turkmen.
The resolution was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ALDE, ECR, and Greens/EFA Groups and Jaroslav PAKA (EFD, SK).
Parliament is deeply concerned at the increasing acts of violence suffered by the civilian population in Iraq, notably between Sunnis and
Shi'ites but also in attacks against religious, ethnic and cultural minorities. It recalls that there has been an ongoing dispute between the
Turkmen, allegedly the third-largest ethnic group in Iraq, and Kurds over Kirkuk, a region rich in oil, with Turkmen subject to attacks and
abductions by both Kurdish forces and Arab extremist groups, and both Sunni and Shia Turkmen being targeted on sectarian grounds.
Members express grave concern that the new surge of instability and sectarian violence in Iraq could jeopardise the forthcoming provincial
elections on 20 April 2013, cancellation of which would jeopardise the chances of a more inclusive governance structure.
The EU is asked to support the Iraqi government in organising peaceful, free and fair elections in April 2013. Parliament also insists that the
Cooperation Council established by the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and Iraq be used as a channel to convey to
the Iraqi side the concerns over the situation of ethnic and religious minorities in the country.
Despite the guarantees of equality before the law for all citizens in the Iraqi Constitution, and guarantees of autonomy for minorities in
Constitution of the Kurdistan Region, the resolution notes that minorities continue to be plagued by ethnic and sectarian violence and
discrimination. Members call on both the Iraqi Government and the regional government of Kurdistan to conduct a full investigation into the
recent terrorist attacks in the region, including the most deadly recent bombing of a Shia mosque in Tuz Khurmatu on 23 January 2013, and to
bring those responsible to justice.
Parliament also appeals to the Iraqi government to declare a moratorium on all executions, with a view to abolishing the death penalty.
Lastly, it applauds the successes achieved by the EUJUST LEX mission and stresses the importance of giving sufficient prominence in
EUJUST LEX initiatives where possible to Turkmen rights and minority rights in general.
