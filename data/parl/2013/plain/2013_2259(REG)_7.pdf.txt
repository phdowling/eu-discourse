Summary

2013/2259(REG) - 26/03/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Constitutional Affairs adopted the report by David MARTIN (S&D, UK) on the amendment of Rule 90 of Parliament's Rules
of Procedure on international agreements.
Members proposed authorising the presentation of opinions in the context of the scrutiny of international agreements by the Parliament: by
extending the scope of application of Rule 90(4) from the duration of the negotiations to the duration of the entire procedure from the beginning
of the negotiations to the conclusion of the agreement, Parliament could intervene at any moment in order to clarify its position in view of the
consent which it is required to give.
Rule 90 paragraph 5 of the Rules should be amended so as to provide that requests by the Council for Parliament's consent or opinion should
be referred by the President to the committee responsible for consideration in accordance with Rule 81 or Rule 43(1).
Before the vote is taken, the committee responsible, a political group or at least one-tenth of the Members may propose that Parliament seek
an opinion from the Court of Justice on the compatibility of an international agreement with the Treaties.

2013/2259(REG) - 16/04/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament decided by 650 votes to 15, with 8 abstentions, to amend Rule 90 of Parliament's Rules of Procedure on
international agreements.
The amendments adopted are as follows:
Opinions in the context of the scrutiny of international agreements by the Parliament (Rule 90(4)): at any stage of the negotiations and from the
end of the negotiations to the conclusion of the international agreement , Parliament may, on the basis of a report from the committee
responsible, adopt recommendations and require them to be taken into account before the conclusion of that agreement.
Review by the committee responsible (Rule 90(5)): requests by the Council for Parliament's consent or opinion should be referred by the
President to the committee responsible for consideration in accordance with Rule 81 or Rule 43(1).
Opinion of the Court of Justice (Rule 90(6)): before the vote is taken, the committee responsible, a political group or at least one-tenth of the
Members may propose that Parliament seek an opinion from the Court of Justice on the compatibility of an international agreement with the
Treaties.
