2013/2087(BUD) - 15/05/2013 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: to mobilise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) to finance technical assistance at the initiative of the Commission.

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
CONTENT: Point 28 of the Interinstitutional Agreement (IIA) of 17 May 2006 between the European Parliament, the Council and the
Commission on budgetary discipline and sound financial management allows for the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment
Fund (EGF) through a flexibility mechanism, within the annual ceiling of EUR 500 million over and above the relevant headings of the financial
framework.
According to Article 8(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 on establishing the EGF, the proportion corresponding to 0.35% of the annual
maximum amount of the EGF can be made available each year for technical assistance at the initiative of the Commission. It is within this
context that the Commission is proposing to mobilise the EGF to cover the technical assistance as set out below:
Technical assistance to be funded (application EGF/2013/000) and breakdown of its estimated costs: the Commission intends to mobilise EUR
750 000 to finance the following tasks:
monitoring: the Commission will continue to collect the data on applications received and paid, and the measures proposed and
implemented, and it will update the Statistical Portrait of the EGF with information up to the end of 2013. Building on the preparatory
work of recent years, this can be done with the Commission's normal administrative resources;
information: the web site on the EGF, which the Commission has set up within its Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion area, and
which it is maintaining will be regularly updated and expanded, with each new element also being translated into all EU languages.
Information on the new EGF Regulation will be produced, and the annual report of the EGF will be produced, translated, printed and
distributed. Costs for all these items are estimated at EUR 80 000;
creation of a knowledge base: the Commission is continuing its work with a view to setting up an electronic application form and
standardised procedures for EGF applications, which will allow applications under the new Regulation to be simplified, their
processing to be speeded up and reports to be more easily extracted for varying needs. It will improve its database containing the
facts and figures of EGF cases, including workers, measures and outcomes. The cost for these items is estimated at EUR 80 000;
administrative and technical support: the Expert Group of Contact Persons of the EGF, with one member from each Member State, will
be holding two meetings, together estimated at EUR 70 000. The Commission will be organising networking among the Member
States. The cost of these items is estimated at EUR 120 000;
evaluation: the Commission will conduct the final phase of the ex-post evaluation of the EGF (2007-2013) by means of a contract with
an external consultant evaluating EGF cases as and when they are closed, and focusing on the impact of the EGF and its added value
during the current period. The cost for this evaluation is estimated at EUR 400 000.
Financing: the total annual budget available for the EGF is EUR 500 million. Article 8(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 states that 0.35% of
this amount (i.e. EUR 1 750 000) can be made available each year for technical assistance at the initiative of the Commission. Currently, the
full amount for 2013 remains available; nothing has yet been allocated to technical assistance. The proposed contribution for technical
assistance at the initiative of the Commission in 2013 is EUR 750 000. Following the mobilisation of this amount, a further EUR 1 000 000
potentially remains available in case of need at a later stage in the year.

Considering the maximum possible amount of a contribution from the EGF in accordance with Article 8(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 as
well as the scope for reallocating appropriations, the Commission proposes to mobilise the EGF for the total amount referred to above, to be
allocated under heading 1a of the financial framework.
Procedure: by presenting this proposal to mobilise the EGF, the Commission initiates the simplified trialogue procedure, as required by Point
28 of the Inter-institutional Agreement of 17 May 2006, with a view to securing the agreement of the two arms of the budgetary authority on the
need to use the EGF and the amount required. The Commission invites the first of the two arms of the budgetary authority that reaches
agreement on the draft mobilisation proposal, at appropriate political level, to inform the other arm and the Commission of its intentions. In
case of disagreement by either of the two arms of the budgetary authority, a formal trialogue meeting will be convened. The Commission
presents separately a transfer request in order to enter in the 2013 budget specific commitment appropriations.
Source of payment appropriations: appropriations from the EGF budget line will be used to cover the amount of EUR 750 000 needed for
technical assistance.

2013/2087(BUD) - 28/06/2013 Budgetary report tabled for plenary, 1st reading
The Committee on Budgets adopted the report by Alda SOUSA (GUE/NGL, PT) on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and
of the Council to mobilise the European Globalisation Fund for EUR 750 000 in commitment and payment appropriations to finance technical
assistance at the initiative of the European Commission (application EGF/2013/000 TA 2013).
Members recall that the European Union with its European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) has set up legislative and budgetary
instruments to provide additional support to workers who are suffering from the consequences of major structural changes in world trade
patterns, aggravated by the economic, financial and social crisis, and to assist their reintegration into the labour market. They stress that the
Union's financial assistance to workers made redundant should be adequate and made available as quickly and efficiently as possible.
They also recall that up to 0.35% of the annual EGF amount can be made available each year for technical assistance at the initiative of the
Commission, in order to finance monitoring, information, administrative and technical support, as well as audit, control and evaluation activities
necessary to implement the EGF Regulation, including the provision of information and guidance for the Member States in using, monitoring
and evaluating the EGF.
Members made a series of general observations on the management of the EGF and the importance of networking and exchange of
information on the EGF. They support the funding of the Expert Group of Contact Persons of the EGF as well as other networking activities
among the Member States as well as measures to further enhance the liaising between all those involved in EGF applications, including
namely the social partners, to create as many synergies as possible.
At the same time, Members are concerned about the possible adverse impact which reducing the staffing level may have on the swift, regular
and effective evaluation of incoming applications and implementation of the EGF technical assistance. They regret that the Commission does
not envisage any particular awareness-raising activities for 2013 given that some Member States, including users of the EGF, question the
utility and advantages of the EGF.
Implementation of the EGF: Members request the Member States and all the institutions involved to make the necessary efforts to improve
procedural and budgetary arrangements in order to accelerate the mobilisation of the EGF.
Members note in this sense, the improved procedure put in place by the Commission, following Parliament's request to accelerate the release
of grants. They welcome the fact that the 2013 budget shows allocated payment appropriations of EUR 50 million on the EGF budget line 04
05 01 in order to avoid using transfers from other budget lines.
On the other hand, they deeply regret the decision of the Council to block the extension of the 'crisis derogation' which allows provision of
financial assistance to workers made redundant as a result of the current social, financial and economic crisis, in addition to those losing their
job because of changes in global trade patterns, and which allows an increase in the rate of Union co-financing to 65% of the programme
costs, for applications submitted after the 31 December 2011 deadline. They call on the Council to reintroduce this measure without delay.
At the same time, Members call on the Parliament to approve the proposal for a decision annexed to this draft resolution.

2013/2087(BUD) - 03/07/2013 Budgetary text adopted by Parliament
The European Parliament adopted by 600 votes to 87, with 18 abstentions, a resolution on the proposal for a decision of the European
Parliament and of the Council to mobilise the European Globalisation Fund for EUR 750 000 in commitment and payment appropriations to
finance technical assistance at the initiative of the European Commission (application EGF/2013/000 TA 2013).
Parliament approved the proposed decision annexed to the resolution.
The resolution is accompanied by a series of general observations on the management of the EGF, its evaluation, the importance of

Parliament fully supports the funding of the Expert Group of Contact Persons of the EGF as well as other networking activities among the

Member States provided for in the proposal as well as measures to further enhance the liaising between all those involved in EGF
applications, including namely the social partners, to create as many synergies as possible.

2013/2087(BUD) - 22/07/2013 Final act
PURPOSE: to mobilise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) to finance technical assistance at the initiative of the Commission.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision 2013/420/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on mobilisation of the European Globalisation
Adjustment Fund, in accordance with point 28 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 between the European Parliament, the
Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and sound financial management (EGF/2013/000 TA 2013 Technical assistance at the
