2013/2098(INI) - 10/12/2013 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development adopted the own-initiative report by Eric Andrieu (ALDE, FR) on regional branding:
towards best practice in rural economies. It welcomed the integrated approach to territorial development outlined in the future framework
regulation on regional policy, noting the need for coordination and consistency between the various European funds as a way of guaranteeing
harmonious, sustainable and balanced territorial development. It also welcomed the concept of community-led local development and called
on Member States to implement this concept and to remove any hindrances to managing this innovative new approach. Although territorial
quality branding was intended to drive a territorial value creation process seeking to encompass products and services within a perspective of
identity and social responsibility and to complement the existing origin-related agri-foodstuff quality labelling schemes, branding of this kind
goes further in that it applies across the board to all products, goods, and services in a given territory and to the management model used by
businesses, institutions, and local actors in that territory.
Member States and their regional authorities were asked to promote more dynamic forms of participatory governance as a way of
implementing common territorial development projects able to cover all economic sectors, including tourism. The report noted that closer
coordination of local actors could help strengthen rural economies, and that the purpose of strategic coordination was to tap resources by
incorporating and going beyond a sectoral or single- industry approach and instead calling for the employment of territorial approaches which
generated new revenue through the marketing of sets of complementary goods and services which reflected the specific characteristics of
each territory. Members called for greater attention to be paid to regional branding initiatives as a possible common theme in European
territorial cooperation and European funding initiatives.
The report went on to call on the Commission to include various forms of tourism involving rural activities in related measures and programmes
such as European Destinations of Excellence (EDEN) and Calypso, and stressed the need for targeted initiatives and programmes to promote
rural tourism activities. The Commission and Member States were also asked to ensure that future rural development programmes provided
for appropriate measures and sufficient resources to facilitate good governance by strengthening the measures based on collective operations:
measures concerning cooperation, coordination, exchanges, networks, innovation, training, producer groups, promotion, information and
investment, provided for in the new rural development regulations.
Taking account of the proliferation of multiple labels and regional brandings regarding food products in Europe Members called on the
Commission to draw up an inventory of brands with specific regional features, in order to avoid any possible negative effects on the quality
schemes. They maintained that the concept of regional branding should be clearly defined, taking into account the favourable experience with
existing quality labels (PDO, AOC, PGI), and that coordinated strategies should be drawn up to avoid duplication and overlapping, proceeding
from a shared common approach based on a framework to be laid down at EU level.

2013/2098(INI) - 14/01/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 532 votes to 66 with 31 abstentions on regional branding: towards best practice in rural economies.
Parliament emphasised that agricultural regions played a multifunctional role involving not only agricultural development but also other
economic and social activities revolving around local skills, know-how and investment in the pinpointing and harnessing of all local assets and
resources. It welcomed the integrated approach to territorial development outlined in the future framework regulation on regional policy, noting
the need for coordination and consistency between the various European funds as a way of guaranteeing harmonious, sustainable and
balanced territorial development. It called on Member States to implement the concept of community-led local development. Although territorial
quality branding was intended to drive a territorial value creation process seeking to encompass products and services within a perspective of

Parliament stressed the need for more dynamic forms of participatory governance as a way of implementing common territorial development
projects able to cover all economic sectors, including tourism. Parliament noted that closer coordination of local actors could help strengthen

Lastly, Parliament invited the Commission to support Member States efforts in promoting new forms of cooperation for rural areas, around the
territorial excellence branding, with the aid of tools included in the CAP reform such as the Unions LEADER initiative, and the European
Innovation Partnership (EIP).
