2013/2277(INI) - 28/02/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has adopted an own-initiative report by Othmar KARAS (EPP, AT) and Liem HOANG
NGOC (S&D, FR) on the enquiry on the role and operations of the Troika (European Central Bank (ECB), Commission and International
Monetary Fund (IMF)) with regard to the euro area programme countries.
The report is to evaluate the functioning of the Troika in the ongoing programmes in the four countries: Greece, Portugal, Ireland and Cyprus.
The Troika: the institutional dimension and democratic legitimacy: because of the evolving nature of the EUs response to the crisis, the unclear
role of the ECB in the Troika and the nature of the Troika decision-making process, the report noted that the Troikas mandate has been
perceived as being unclear and lacking in transparency and democratic oversight.
Members pointed out that the rescue mechanisms and the Troika are of an ad hoc nature, and regretted that there was no appropriate legal
basis available for setting up the Troika on the basis of Union primary law, which has led to the establishment of intergovernmental
mechanisms in the form of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), and eventually the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). They
asked that any future solution be based on Union primary law, which might lead to the need for a Treaty change.
The report questioned the dual role of the Commission in the Troika as both an agent of Member States and an EU institution and asserted
that there is a potential conflict of interest within the Commission between its role in the Troika and its responsibility as guardian of the Treaties
and the acquis communautaire. It pointed equally to the potential conflict of interest between the current role of the ECB in the Troika as
technical advisor and its position as creditor of the four Member States. Furthermore, it regretted the fact that by reason of its statutes, the IMF
cannot appear formally before or report in writing to national parliaments or the European Parliament . It stressed that the IMFs involvement as
lender of last resort providing up to one third of the funding places the institution in a minority role.
Members regretted that the troika is lacking, because of its structure, the means of democratic legitimacy at EU level. They deplored the way
EU institutions are being portrayed as the scapegoat for adverse effects in Member States' macroeconomic adjustment, when it is the Member
States' finance ministers who bear the political responsibility for the Troika and its operations. It is therefore demanded that the Eurogroup, the
Council and the European Council assume full responsibility for the operations of the Troika.
Proposals and recommendations:
1) In the short to medium term, the report called for: i) the establishment of clear, transparent and binding rules of procedure for the interaction
between the institutions within the Troika and the allocation of tasks and responsibility therein; ii) the development of an improved
communication strategy for ongoing and future financial assistance programmes.
Members recalled that the position adopted by the Parliament on Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 entailed introducing provisions requiring the

macroeconomic adjustment programmes to include contingency plans in case baseline forecast scenarios should not materialise and in case
of slippage due to circumstances outside the control of the Member State under assistance, such as unexpected international economic
shocks. The report stressed that such plans are a prerequisite for prudent policymaking, given the fragility and poor reliability of economic
models underpinning programme forecasts.
The report also stressed that pursuing economic and financial stability in the Member States and the Union as a whole must not undermine
social stability, the European social model or the social rights of EU citizens . It called for the necessary involvement of the social partners in
the design and implementation of current and future adjustment programmes.
The Commission is invited to start interinstitutional negotiations with Parliament in order to define a common procedure for informing the
competent committee of Parliament on the conclusions drawn from the monitoring of the macroeconomic adjustment programme, as well as
the progress made in the preparation of the draft macroeconomic adjustment programme.
Members proposed that for each programme country the Commission should set up a growth task force consisting inter alia of experts from
(inter alia) the Member States and the EIB, in association with representatives of the private sector and civil society in order to suggest options
to promote growth which would complement fiscal consolidation and structural reforms.
By the end of 2015, the Commission should present a detailed study of the economic and social consequences of the adjustment programmes
in the four countries.
The report also called for: i) a reassessment of the decision-making process of the Eurogroup so as to include appropriate democratic
accountability at both national and European levels; ii) the integration of the ESM in the Union's legal framework so that it becomes a
Community-based mechanism.
2) In the longer term, the report recommended clarifying the respective roles and tasks of each participant in the Troika in the following ways:
·

The creation of a European Monetary Fund (EMF), which would combine the financial means of the ESM and the human resources
that the Commission has acquired over the last few years, would take over the Commission's role, allowing the latter to act in
conformity with Article 17 of the TEU and, in particular, to act as guardian of the Treaties;

·

the ECB would participate as a silent observer during the negotiation process, in order to enable it to raise strong concerns in its
advising role to the Commission, and later to the European Monetary Fund if appropriate;

·

the IMF, should its involvement be strictly necessary, would be a marginal lender and therefore could leave the programme if in
disagreement.

The next Parliament would be invited to pursue the work of this report.

2013/2277(INI) - 13/03/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 448 votes to 140 with 27 abstentions, a resolution on the enquiry on the role and operations of the
Troika (ECB, Commission and IMF) with regard to the euro area programme countries.
The Troika, consisting of the European Commission, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), originated
in the decision of 25 March 2010 by euro area Heads of State and Government to establish a joint programme and to provide conditional
bilateral loans to Greece, thereby also building on recommendations from the Ecofin Council. It has also been operational in Portugal, Ireland
and Cyprus.
Within the Troika, the Commission, acting as an agent of the Eurogroup, is entrusted with negotiating the conditions for financial assistance for
euro area Member States in liaison with the ECB, and, wherever possible together with the IMF, the EU-IMF financial assistance. The Council
is politically responsible for approving the macroeconomic adjustment programmes.
This resolution was to evaluate the functioning of the Troika in the ongoing programmes in the four countries which are Greece, Portugal,
Ireland and Cyprus. Parliament recognised that the immediate objective of avoiding chaotic payment defaults had been met and that the
challenges faced by the Troika had been considerable. However, it underlined many weaknesses and recommended improvements, urgent
and longer term.
The Troika: the institutional dimension and democratic legitimacy: because of the evolving nature of the EUs response to the crisis, the unclear
role of the ECB in the Troika and the nature of the Troika decision-making process, Parliament noted that the Troikas mandate has been
perceived as being unclear and lacking in transparency and democratic oversight, which has bred Euroscepticism.
Members, pointing out that the rescue mechanisms and the Troika are of an ad hoc nature, regretted that there was no appropriate legal basis
available for setting up the Troika on the basis of Union primary law, which has led to the establishment of intergovernmental mechanisms in
the form of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), and eventually the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). They asked that any
future solution be based on Union primary law, which might lead to the need for a Treaty change.
Parliament questioned several points:
·

the dual role of the Commission in the Troika as both an agent of Member States and an EU institution; a potential conflict of interest
existed within the Commission between its role in the Troika and its responsibility as guardian of the Treaties and the acquis
communautaire;

·

the potential conflict of interest between the current role of the ECB in the Troika as technical advisor and its position as creditor of
the four Member States;

·

the fact that the IMF because of its statutes, cannot appear formally before or report in writing to national parliaments or the
European Parliament. It was stressed that the IMFs involvement as lender of last resort providing up to one third of the funding
places the institution in a minority role.

Members regretted that the troika is lacking, because of its structure, the means of democratic legitimacy at EU level. They also deplored the
way EU institutions were being portrayed as the scapegoat for adverse effects in Member States macroeconomic adjustment, when it is the

Member States finance ministers who bear the political responsibility for the Troika and its operations. They therefore demanded that the
Eurogroup, the Council and the European Council assume full responsibility for the operations of the Troika.
Proposals and recommendations:
1) In the short to medium term, the resolution called for: i) the establishment of clear, transparent and binding rules of procedure for the
interaction between the institutions within the Troika and the allocation of tasks and responsibility therein; ii) the development of an improved
