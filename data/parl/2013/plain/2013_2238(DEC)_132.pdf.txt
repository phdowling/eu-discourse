Analysis of the accounts of the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA).

prepared on the basis of the information presented by the institutions, organisations and bodies of the EU, in accordance with Article 129 (2) of

(EIOPA).
In 2012, the tasks and budget of this agency were as follows:

2013/2238(DEC) - 10/09/2013 Court of Auditors: opinion, report
PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions
Authority (EIOPA) for the year 2012, together with the EIOPAs reply.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit concerned, amongst others, the annual accounts of the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA).
In the Courts opinion, EIOPAs Annual Accounts fairly present, in all material respects, its financial position as of 31 December 2012 and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions of its Financial Regulation and the
accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
The Court also considers that the transactions underlying the annual accounts of the Authority for the financial year ended 31 December 2012
are, in all material respects, legal and regular.
The report confirms that the Authoritys 2012 budget amounted to EUR 15 655 000
The report also makes a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of the Authority, accompanied by the latters
response. The main observations may be summarised as follows:
The Courts observations:
procurement procedures: one contract related to the design of a financial database was subdivided into four lots of EUR 60 000 each,
which were all directly awarded to two companies. Given the total value of the services to be procured for the same project (EUR 240
000 euro), an open or restricted procedure should have been applied and the related commitments and payments are thus irregular.
The Authoritys reply:
there is sound business rationale backing both the decision to run a procurement, and to do it in 4 separate lots, in order to deepen
knowledge on how to design the system, reducing the risk of acquiring the wrong services and products and ensuring sufficient
competition in the core stage of the process, namely the main procurement.
Lastly, the Court of Auditors report contains a summary of the Authoritys activities in 2012. This is focused on the following:
regulatory and supervisory tasks;
consumer protection and financial innovation ;
common supervisory culture and related events ;
bi-annual Financial Stability Reports and preparation of Europe-wide stress test for the insurance sector ;
finalisation of a comprehensive, decision-making framework setting in detail the processes that the Authority will follow in discharging
its crisis and management responsibilities ;
actions relating to external relations.

2013/2238(DEC) - 21/03/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Petri SARVAMAA (EPP, FI) in which it recommended the European Parliament to
grant discharge to the Executive Director of the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority in respect of the implementation of
the Authority's budget for the financial year 2012.
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the Authority for the financial
year 2012 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Members approved the closure of the Authoritys accounts.
They made, however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is granted, in addition to the
general recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies.
Financing, budget and financial management: Members noted that budget monitoring efforts during the financial year 2012 resulted in
an overall budget implementation rate of 90.63%. They noted with concern that the payment appropriations execution rate was
67.21%.
Carryovers: Members regretted that the carry-over of committed appropriations to 2013 was very high for title III (operational
expenditure) at 79% of total appropriations even if they acknowledged that this is mainly the result of the complexity and of the lengthy
duration of one IT procurement procedure. They also regretted that one contract related to the design of a financial database was
subdivided into four lots of EUR 60 000 each, which were all directly awarded to two companies. According to the Members, an open
or restricted procedure should have been applied and that the related commitments and payments are thus irregular.
Members also made a series of observations on transfers, procurement and recruitment procedures as well as comments on internal controls.
Lastly, they acknowledged that the Authority adopted its Ethics Rules in 2011 and established specific provisions for its Stakeholders Groups
and Board of Appeal to handle potential conflicts of interests. They called on the Authority to inform the discharge authority whether it intends
to review its Ethic Rules on the basis of the Commission's Guidelines.

procurement and called on the Authority to improve the situation.
