Summary

2013/2636(RSP) - 12/09/2013 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a resolution tabled by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on the Commissions
second report on the implementation of the EU Internal Security Strategy. It finds it regrettable that this communication expresses scant
criticism of the activities carried out under the ISS, reaffirming the same priorities as its initial communication of November 2010 and failing, in
particular, to take account of the consequences of the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights , most of the provisions of which
apply not only to EU citizens but to everyone on EU territory.
It expresses serious concern at the fact that EU institutions and Member States' authorities and citizens have been subjected to secret
surveillance by Member States, third countries and third parties, with the collaboration of private companies. Members call on the EU and
Member State institutions to inquire into, and take follow-up actions on the matter. Any EU internal security strategy must be aimed at
defending EU institutions, and EU Member States and their citizens from illegal foreign surveillance and undue influence and manipulation.
Parliament wants to see a strengthening of the security and confidentiality of EU communication and logistics systems against third-party or
foreign surveillance, noting that the right of citizens to privacy and data protection and the right of access to documents and information are
fundamental European values and rights.
The resolution makes a series of recommendations concerning the proper analysis of, including the following:
·

since it is the only European institution which is elected by direct suffrage to scrutinise and exercise democratic control over the EU's
policies, the European Parliament must play a key role in assessing and formulating internal security policies , as the latter have a
strong impact on the fundamental rights of all people living in the EU;

·

the Commission should produce a cross-sectoral overview of natural risks and man-made threats in the EU;

·

the supply of information by Member States to Europol should be enhanced by strengthening the Member States' duty to cooperate
with Europol;

·

common legal standards and operating tools should be promoted in order to fight organized crime;

·

the Commission and the Council should prioritise the fight against corruption and money laundering;

·

the financial sector must work more closely with government agencies to identify gaps in current regulations and implement
innovative techniques in combating organised crime and terrorist financing;

·

the Commission should make sufficient funds available for the new European Cybercrime Centre.

Whilst stressing that the fight against terrorism is a priority within the ISS, Parliament questions the Union's priorities with regard to the actual
origin of terrorist attacks, and insists on the need to give greater priority to prevention policies alongside repressive measures. It notes the
need for allocation of the corresponding resources to targeted policing measures and information services, so that terrorist attacks can actually
be prevented, and calls for proper evaluation of the threat posed by violent political radicalisation.
Lastly, Members call on the Commission to start preparing a new ISS for the 2015-2019 period, taking Parliament's input concerning the new
ISS properly into account.
