2013/2230(DEC) - 26/07/2013 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: presentation by the Commission of the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2012, as part of
the 2012 discharge procedure.
Analysis of the accounts of the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Members
States (FRONTEX).
CONTENT: this Commission document sets out the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2012 as
prepared on the basis of the information presented by the institutions, organisations and bodies of the EU, in accordance with Article 129 (2) of
the Financial Regulation applicable to the EU's General Budget, including the European Agency for the Management of Operational
Cooperation at the External Borders of the Members States (FRONTEX).
In 2012, the tasks and budget of this agency were as follows:
description of the Agency's tasks: FRONTEX, which is located in Warsaw, was established by Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004,
amended by Regulation (EC) No 863/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council. Its main task is to coordinate Member
States' activities in the field of the management of external borders and to set up European Border Guard Teams (EBGT) to be
deployed during joint operations;
the Agencys budget for the 2012 financial year: the Agencys budget for 2012, as presented in the Commission document on the
consolidated annual accounts of the European Union, gives the following figures
§

Commitment appropriations :
- committed : EUR 90 million;
- paid : EUR 89 million;
- carried-over : EUR 1 million.

§

Payment appropriations :
- committed : EUR 128 million;
- paid : EUR 99 million;
- carried-over : EUR 22 million.

Please refer also to the final accounts of the FRONTEX Agency.

2013/2230(DEC) - 10/09/2013 Court of Auditors: opinion, report
PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the European Agency for the Management of
Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States (Frontex) for the year 2012, together with Frontexs reply.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit concerned, amongst others, the annual accounts of the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the
External Borders of the Member States (Frontex).
In the Courts opinion, Frontexs Annual Accounts fairly present, in all material respects, its financial position as of 31 December 2012 and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions of its Financial Regulation and the
accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
However, the Court gives a disclaimer of opinion on the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the accounts . In 2012,
expenditure related to grants amounted to EUR 56 million, representing 63 % of total operating expenditure. In order to verify the expenditure
claimed by beneficiaries the Agency performs reasonableness checks prior to payment but does not usually request supporting
documentation. However, no 2012 expenditure has yet been verified. In the absence of effective ex ante and ex post verifications, there is no
assurance on the legality and regularity of the 2012 transactions related to grants.
The Court has not been able to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to provide a basis for an audit opinion and, accordingly, the Court
does not express an opinion on the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the accounts.
The report confirms that Frontexs 2012 budget amounted to EUR 89.6 million.
The report also makes a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of Frontex, accompanied by the latters response.
The main observations may be summarised as follows:
The Courts observations:
·

budgetary management: the Court notes that the Agencys 2012 budget amounted to EUR 89.6 million of which EUR 21.8 million (25
% of committed appropri-ations) were carried over to 2013. Such a high level of carry-overs is excessive and at odds with the
budgetary principle of annuality;

·

recruitment: the recruitment procedures examined showed significant shortcomings affecting transparency and the equal treatment of
candidates.

Frontexs reply:
·

regularity of transactions: the beneficiaries of Frontex are the national border guard authorities of Member States and Schengen
Associated Countries. When claiming for reimbursement, they must certify that all information provided is full, reliable and true.
Frontex does not consider, therefore, that effective ex ante controls are absent, but they are based on declarations made by public
authorities and plausibility checks. However, Frontex undertook measures to strengthen the ex ante control framework and since
June 2013, a risk based ex ante control system has been put in place;

·

carry-overs: commitments for activities financed out of the 2012 budget were made very late in the year and will partly be
implemented in 2013 only;

·

recruitment: Frontex states it will improve its recruitment procedures.

Lastly, the Court of Auditors report contains a summary of Frontexs activities in 2012. This is focused on the following:
provide necessary assistance to the development and operation of a European border surveillance system (EUROSUR);
organisation of 17 joint operations;
coordinated joint return operations with 2 110 people returned;
3 503 days operational days accumulated in all joint operations (the number of operational man-days accumulated equals to 117 114);
organising Frontex Situation Centre (FSC) : situational report ; Frontex-One-Stop-Shop) ;
media contributions ;
training ;
partnership and cooperation with third countries: working arrangements were concluded with the Immigration Service of Nigeria and
with the National Security Council of Armenia, increasing the overall number of working arrangements to 18 ;
cooperation with EU institutions and bodies and international organisations.

2013/2230(DEC) - 20/03/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Petri SARVAMAA (EPP, FI) on discharge in respect of the implementation of the
budget of the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the
European Union (FRONTEX) for the financial year 2012, and called on the European Parliament to grants the Executive Director of the
Agency discharge in respect of the implementation of the Agency's budget for the financial year 2012.
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the Agency for the financial
year 2012 are reliable, Members regretted that the Court of Auditors was not able to express an opinion on the legality and regularity of the

transactions underlying the accounts.
They made a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is granted, in addition to the general
recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies.
·

Legality and regularity of transactions underlying the accounts: Members regretted that the Court of Auditors could not obtain
sufficient appropriate audit evidence on the legality and regularity of the audited grant transactions related to the Agencys activities
in 2012, which amount to EUR 56 000 000, representing 63 % of the operating expenditure. They remarked that the Agency stated
measures had been taken to justify certain expenditure and they called on the Agency to come up with a mutually acceptable
solution, which took into account the Court of Auditors audit standards.

·

Financing, budget and financial management: Members recalled that the Agency's overall budget for 2012 amounted to EUR 84 000
000.

·

Implementation rate of appropriations: the report observed that the budget monitoring efforts during the financial year 2012 resulted
in a budget implementation rate of 98.86 % and that the payment appropriations execution rate was 75.23 %. Notes with concern
that the level of carry-overs is excessive, as it was in 2011, and is at odds with the budgetary principle of annuality;

·

Recruitment procedures: the committee noted that the Court of Auditors had identified shortcomings in the Agencys recruitment
procedures which affect transparency and equal treatment of candidates, and it awaited clarification.

Lastly, they asked FRONTEX to strengthen transparency and prevent conflicts of interests, as well as make publicly available the Declarations
of Interests of certain members.

2013/2230(DEC) - 03/04/2014 Final act
PURPOSE: to grant discharge to the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders (FRONTEX)
for the financial year 2012.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision 2014/617/EU of the European Parliament on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of
the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders for the financial year 2012.
CONTENT: with the present decision, the European Parliament grants discharge to the Executive Director of the FRONTEX in respect of the
implementation of its budget for the financial year 2012.
This decision is in line with the European Parliament's resolution adopted on 3 April 2014 and comprises a series of observations that form an
integral part of the discharge decision (please refer to the summary of the opinion of 3 April 2014).
Amongst the main observations made, Parliament regretted that because of the materiality and pervasiveness of the matter described on the
basis of a disclaimer of opinion, the Court of Auditors was not able to express an opinion on the legality and regularity of the transactions
underlying the accounts. It therefore invited FRONTEX to find a solution that addresses the audit standards of the Court of Auditors.

2013/2230(DEC) - 03/04/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a decision concerning the discharge to be granted to the Executive Director of the European Agency for the
Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (FRONTEX) in respect of the
implementation of the Agency's budget for the financial year 2012. The vote on the discharge decision approved the closure of the accounts
(in accordance with Annex VI, Article 5(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament.
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the Agency for the financial
year 2012 are reliable but that it could not obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence on the legality and regularity of the underlying
transactions, Parliament adopted by 472 votes to 70, with 22 abstentions, a resolution containing a series of recommendations that form an
integral part of the discharge decision and as well as the general recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance,
financial management and control of EU agencies.
These recommendations are summarised as follows:
Legality and regularity of transactions underlying the accounts: Parliament regretted that the Court of Auditors could not obtain
sufficient appropriate audit evidence on the legality and regularity of the audited grant transactions related to the Agencys activities in
2012, which amount to EUR 56 million, representing 63% of the operating expenditure. It remarked that the Agency stated measures
had been taken to justify certain expenditure and they called on the Agency to come up with a mutually acceptable solution, which
took into account the Court of Auditors audit standards.
Commitments and carryovers: it noted that budget monitoring efforts during the financial year 2012 resulted in a budget
implementation rate of 98.86% and that the payment appropriations execution rate was 75.23%. It noted that the level of carry-overs is
excessive, as it was in 2011, and is at odds with the budgetary principle of annuality.
Recruitment procedures: Parliament noted that the Court of Auditors had identified shortcomings in the Agencys recruitment
procedures which affect transparency and equal treatment of candidates, and it awaited clarification.
Performance: Parliament requested that the Agency communicate the results and impact its work has on European citizens in an
accessible way, mainly through its website.
It acknowledged that the Agency has put in place several measures to manage and prevent situations of conflicts of interests and developed a
detailed disciplinary procedure. It called on the Agency to indicate whether or not it has established a specific policy for the prevention and
management of conflicts of interests based on the Commission's guidelines.
