Summary

The European Parliament adopted by 37 votes to 0 with 1 abstention a resolution on the situation of Rohingya Muslims. The resolution was
tabled by the ECR, S&D, Greens/EFA, ALDE, GUE/NGL and EPP groups. It condemns the grave violations of human rights and the violence
perpetrated against Rohingya Muslims in Burma/Myanmar, which continues to intensify, notably through the destruction of property and places
of worship, mass arrests, arbitrary imprisonment, torture, and rape. Whilst recognising the steps taken by President U Thein Sein and other
reformers in Burma/Myanmar to introduce democratic reforms over the past year, Parliament deplores the failure of the government to protect
the Rohingya from organised violence, and calls for an end the human rights abuses and bring the perpetrators of the violent attacks to justice.
It expresses deep concerns over allegations that members of Burmese security forces have participated in the violence, and repeats its urgent
calls an independent investigation into these allegations.
Members want the Vice-President / High Representative and EEAS to:
·

address this issue at the highest possible political level in contacts with Burma/Myanmar and with other ASEAN member countries;

·

consult Parliament regularly on the process of establishing a human rights dialogue with Burma/Myanmar;

·

set a list of precise human rights benchmarks against which to assess reform progress by the Burmese authorities, underlining the
fact that further development of EU relations with the Burmese leadership should be conditional on tangible progress with regard to
the Rohingya situation.

Recalling that the EU has recently reinstalled its Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) vis-à-vis Burma/Myanmar, they reiterate the
conditionality of these preferences as regards respect for human rights and urge the Commission to monitor closely the progress made by the
Burmese authorities in respecting these conditions. When submitting to Parliament and the Council a delegated act for the continued
application of the GSP system to Burma/Myanmar after 31 December 2013, the Commission should include an accompanying report
demonstrating the absence of serious and systematic violations of the principles laid down in the conventions listed in the GSP regulation, with
particular focus on the Rohingya. Furthermore, the Commission is asked to assess the human rights impact of the envisaged bilateral
investment agreement before formulating its proposal for negotiating directives, and in this process closely to consult Parliament and civil
society. There must be a strong civil society component, in which the Rohingya are represented, to participate in the EU-Burma Task Force to
be established later this year.
Members also note that over 130 000 displaced Rohingyas remain in camps, and the Government of Burma/Myanmar has allowed inadequate
humanitarian access to Rohingya populations at risk. Parliament calls on the Government of Burma/Myanmar to:
·

provide UN agencies and humanitarian NGOs with unhindered access to all areas of the country, including Rakhine state;

·

improve conditions in the Rohingya displacement camps as a matter of urgency;

·

authorise the establishment of an OHCHR office, with branch offices in the provinces, in order to allow for adequate monitoring of the
human rights situation;

·

implement durable solutions to the underlying causes of the tensions, including measures addressing the status of the Rohingya;

·

repeal of the 1982 Citizenship Law in order that Rohingyas have equal access to Burmese citizenship;

·

repeal immediately the two-child policy announced recently along with other coercive or discriminatory policies, rules, regulations or
laws;

Noting, lastly, that 1 700 Rohingyas fleeing Burma are reported to be held in horrendous conditions in Thai immigration detention centres,
Parliament calls on the Government of Thailand, which has so far failed to permit the UNHCR to conduct refugee status determination
screenings of Rohingya asylum seekers, to end inhumane detention and provide access to UN refugee agencies.
