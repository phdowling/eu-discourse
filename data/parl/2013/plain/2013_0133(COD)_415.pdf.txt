2013/0133(COD) - 02/05/2013 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE : to amend the provision concerning fishing seasons regarding bluefin tuna in Council Regulation (EC) No 302/2009.
PROPOSED ACT : Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF PARLIAMENT : the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with
the Council.
BACKGROUND : the EU is a Party to the International Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas ("the Convention"), which
established the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas ("ICCAT"). At its 16th Special Meeting in 2008, ICCAT

adopted Recommendation 08-05 to establish a new recovery plan for Bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and in the Mediterranean, and
Regulation (EC) No 302/20095 was adopted to implement those international conservation measures at Union level. This was later amended
by Regulation (EU) No 500/2012.
At its 18th Special Meeting in 2012, ICCAT adopted Recommendation 12-03, which provides for:
·

a modification of the fishing seasons;

·

defining fishing seasons as open seasons, as opposed to closed seasons indicated in the previous ICCAT Recommendations;

·

a modification of the actual dates when fishing is permitted by purse seiners, bait boats and trolling boats;

·

explicitly allowing all other gears the possibility of fishing all year round to avoid any uncertainty for those gears which are not subject
to any specific rules on fishing seasons.

Pending the entry into force of ICCAT Recommendation 12-03 and its comprehensive implementation, this proposal aims to modify the
provisions on fishing seasons in Regulation (EC) No 302/2009 in order to ensure effective conservation of the bluefin tunastock.
IMPACT ASSESSMENT : no impact assessment was undertaken. Member States concerned by this fishery (Cyprus, Spain, France, Greece,
Italy, Malta and Portugal) were consulted on 11th December 2012 on the need to clarify the dates of the fishing season, and are agreed on the
modifications to the dates of the fishing season.
LEGAL BASIS : Article 43 (2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union
CONTENT : this proposal aims to amend Regulation (EC) No 302/2009 to reflect ICCAT Recommendation 12-03 regarding fishing seasons.
Fishing seasons: bluefin tuna fishing will be permitted in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean:
·

by large-scale pelagic long line catching vessels over 24 m during the period from 1 January to 31 May with the exception of the area
delimited by West of 10?W and North of 42?N, where such fishing shall be permitted from 1 August to 31 January;

·

by purse seine fishing during the period from 26 May to 24 June;

·

by bait boats and trolling boats during the period from 1 July to 31 October;

·

by pelagic trawlers in the eastern Atlantic during the period from 16 June to 14 October ;

·

as recreational and sport fishing from 16 June to 14 October.

Fishing for Bluefin tuna by other gears than those mentioned above will be permitted throughout the year.
Date of application: this amendment will apply with retroactive effect from 1 January 2013. This will allow Member States properly to define
their fishing capacity and inspection plans which are linked to the fishing seasons and ensure legal certainty.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this proposal has no impact on the EU budget.

2013/0133(COD) - 12/02/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Fisheries adopted the report by Raül ROMEVA i RUEDA (Greens/EFA, ES) on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 302/2009 concerning a multiannual recovery plan for Bluefin
tuna in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean.
The parliamentary committee recommended that the position adopted by the European Parliament at first reading under the ordinary
legislative procedure should amend the Commissions proposal as follows:
Fishing seasons: Members introduced an amendment which reflects the amendment adopted at the 2013 meeting of the International
Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). This recommendation stated that the Contracting Parties and Cooperating
non-Contracting Parties, Entities or Fishing Entities may specify a different starting date for the fishing seasons for their bait boats and trolling
boats operating in the eastern Atlantic, while keeping the total duration of the open season for these fisheries.
Furthermore, whilst the Commission proposed that fishing for Bluefin tuna by other gears than those mentioned in paragraphs 1 to 5 shall be
permitted throughout the year, Members wished to specify that fishing for Bluefin tuna by traps, small longliners (< 24m) and handliners shall
be permitted throughout the year.
Use of stereoscopic cameras during caging operations: Members introduced a new article providing for the use of stereoscopic cameras
during caging operations under certain conditions. In particular, the sampling intensity of live fish shall not be below 20% of the amount of fish
being caged. The width and height of the transfer gate connecting the donor cage and the receiving cage shall be set at maximum of 10
meters.
The information communicated on the results of the stereoscopical programme shall indicate the margin of error inherent to the technical
specifications of the stereoscopic camera system, which shall not exceed +/-5%.

2013/0133(COD) - 16/04/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 556 votes to 6, with 13 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 302/2009 concerning a multiannual recovery plan for Bluefin
tuna in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean.
Parliament adopted its position at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure. The amendments adopted in plenary are the result
of an agreement reached between the European Parliament and the Council. They amended the proposal as follows:

Fishing seasons: Parliament and the Council introduced an amendment which reflected the recommendation adopted at the International
Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) in 2013. This recommendation allow modifications to the fishing seasons for
baitboats and trolling boats in the eastern Atlantic that do not affect the protection of the Bluefin tuna spawning grounds in the Mediterranean.
In this context, for the years 2014 and 2015, and since the protection of the spawning grounds is not affected, Member States may specify, in
their annual national fishing plans, a different starting date for baitboats and trolling boats flying their flag and operating in the eastern Atlantic,
provided that the total duration of the open season for those fisheries continues to comply with the Regulation.
Use of stereoscopic cameras during caging operations: the colegislators introduced a new article providing for the use of stereoscopic camera
systems in the context of caging operations shall comply with the following conditions.
In particular: (i) the sampling intensity of live fish shall not be below 20% of the amount of fish being caged; (ii) samples should be made up of
fish measured at a distance of between 2 and 8 m from the camera; (iii) the dimensions of the transfer gate connecting the donor cage and the
receiving cage shall be set at a maximum width of 10 m and a maximum height of 10 m.
The information as regards the results of the stereoscopical programme should indicate the margin of error inherent to the technical
specifications of the stereoscopic camera system, which shall not exceed +/- 5.

2013/0133(COD) - 15/05/2014 Final act
PURPOSE: to amend Council Regulation No (EC) n° 302/2009 concerning a multiannual recovery plan for Bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic
and Mediterranean.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Regulation (EU) No 544/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC)
No 302/2009 concerning a multiannual recovery plan for Bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean
CONTENT: the Regulation aims to amend Regulation (EC) No 302/2009 concerning a multiannual recovery plan for Bluefin tuna in the eastern
Atlantic and Mediterranean.
At its annual meeting in 2012, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna (ICCAT) adopted a recommendation further
amending the multiannual recovery plan for bluefin tuna to better adapt the fishing seasons to the activity of the fleets. In 2013, ICCAT
adopted a complement to this recommendation in order to allow modifications to the fishing seasons for baitboats and trolling boats in the
eastern Atlantic that do not affect the protection of bluefin tuna spawning grounds in the Mediterranean. This complement also lays down rules
for the use of stereoscopic cameras in the context of caging operations.
The purpose of the Regulation is to transpose into EU law the latest ICCAT recommendation modifying the recovery plan for bluefin tuna in the
Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean. The EU has been a party to ICCAT since 1997.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 01.06.2014.
