Summary

The European Parliament adopted by 32 votes to 29, with 2 abstentions, a resolution on the case of Arafat Jaradat and the situation of
Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.
The resolution was tabled by the S&D, ALDE, GUE/NGL and Greens/EFA Groups and Jaroslav PAKA (EFD, SK).
Parliament expresses its deepest concern about the death of Palestinian prisoner Arafat Jaradat on 23 February 2013 while in Israeli custody,
and about the renewed tensions in the West Bank following Mr Jaradat's death.
Members recall that on the basis of the autopsy, the Palestinian authorities maintain that Jaradat died as a result of torture, and they call on
the Israeli authorities promptly to open independent, impartial and transparent investigations into the circumstances of this death.
Parliament wants the European External Action Service and Member States to monitor the fate of Palestinian prisoners and detainees ,
including women and children, and to raise this issue at all levels of political dialogue with Israel. This matter should be included in the
forthcoming European Neighbourhood Policy progress report on Israel.
Noting that according to a statement made by Palestinian and Israeli human rights organisations in March 2013, at least 71 Palestinian
prisoners are reported to have died as a direct result of torture in Israeli detention centres since 1967, Parliament wants similar investigations
into all allegations of torture of Palestinian prisoners. It is also concerned about the 178 Palestinian detainees including 9 Palestinian
Legislative Council (PLC), held in administrative detention without charge or trial on the basis of evidence that is not accessible to either the
detainees or their lawyers, and they state that these detainees should be charged and face trial, or be promptly released. All imprisoned
members of the PLC, including Marwan Barghouti, should be immediately released.
Lastly, Parliament calls for a Parliamentary fact-finding mission to assess the current situation with regard to the detention conditions of
Palestinian prisoners, including women and children, and the use of administrative detention.
