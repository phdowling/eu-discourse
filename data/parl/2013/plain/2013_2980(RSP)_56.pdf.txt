Summary

The European Parliament adopted a resolution on the Central African Republic. The resolution was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ALDE,
Greens/EFA, and ECR groups.
Violence: Members strongly condemned the serious violations of humanitarian law and widespread violations of human rights law, notably by
former Séléka and militia groups, in particular those known as anti-balaka, and expressed strong concern about the new dynamic of violence
and retaliation prevailing in the CAR, involving the most serious crimes under international law, such as war crimes and crimes against
humanity. They were equally concerned about the possible spill-over effect, which threatened to destabilise the whole region, and condemned
the complete breakdown of law and order, the absence of the rule of law and sectarian violence, and welcomed the UN Security Council
decision on an arms embargo against the CAR.
Security: Parliament welcomed the swift deployment of French military troops pursuant to the authorisation given by UN Security Council and
also welcomed the EUR 50 million provided by the EU in support of AFISMA-CAR. It called on the international community to make the
necessary financial, troop and other contributions to the scaling-up of the primarily African international security presence and ensure the
implementation of its mandate, deploring the slow pace at which a United Nations Peace-keeping mission is being established. The Council
was asked to examine the possibility of organising training and support for the African force being deployed in the country (MISCA ), as has
been done for AMISOM. Members noted the need for Africa to establish an adequate continental security capacity, and they called on the EU
to step up support for the practical establishment of the African Capacity for Immediate Reaction to Crisis (CARIC) launched in June 2013.
Human rights: Members pointed out that the situation in the CAR has already been brought before the ICC, and stressed that there should be
no impunity for perpetrators of gross human rights and international humanitarian law violations. Urgent measures needed to be taken to
combat violence against women and girls.
Humanitarian aspects: welcoming the establishment of an aerial humanitarian bridge by the EU, through ECHO flights as of 9 December,
Parliament saluted the efforts by the External Action Service and the Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid in responding swiftly to the situation.
It also welcomed the increased EU support in addressing the humanitarian crisis in the CAR. The international community must keep the CAR
at the top of its agenda and maintain its commitment there, in spite of the current political and security situation. All parties to the conflict, and
particularly the Séléka, must allow safe and unhindered access for humanitarian and relief organisations.
Development: Members noted the EU has never suspended development cooperation with the country, and on 5 December 2013, the EU
offered EUR 50 million for the African-led International Support Mission in the CAR. They called on the International Contact Group on the
CAR to provide the necessary financial support to create viable economic development, and insisted that a comprehensive political solution,
including fair distribution of revenue through the state budget, was vital for finding solutions, as was transparency and public scrutiny in the
mining sector.
Political Process: Parliament reiterated its support for the Prime Minister, Nicolas Tiangaye, who had the support of the international
community. It called on the CAR authorities to implement the agreements concerning the political transition in order to allow the holding of
elections and a return to constitutional order by February 2015, noting that state structures and control had been eroded to a point where little
remained of them.
