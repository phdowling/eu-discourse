Summary

2013/2133(INI) - 27/11/2013 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Foreign Affairs adopted the own-initiative report by Elisabeth JEGGLE (EPP, DE) containing the European Parliaments
recommendation to the Council, the Commission and the European External Action Service on the negotiations for an EU-Canada Strategic
Partnership Agreement (SPA).
Members recalled that the relations between the EU and Canada were built on shared interests and values formally dating back to 1976. The
SPA currently under negotiation would update and revitalise the relationship between the EU and Canada and considerably contribute to the
relations between the parties. The Agreement would improve not only the institutional structure of relations, but would also provide Europes
and Canadas citizens with tangible benefits and opportunities in light of broadening the transatlantic market.
In this context, Members called on Parliament to address the following recommendations to the Council, the Commission and the European
External Action Service:
Conditionality clause: Members indicated that all EU agreements with third countries should include reciprocal conditionality and political
clauses on human rights and democracy, as a reaffirmation of the mutual commitment to these values and regardless of the state of protection
of human rights in those countries. Accordingly, Members insisted that such conditionality should form part of the SPA with Canada, should
ensure the consistency of the EUs common approach on the matter.
Complementary nature of SPA and Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement: Members encouraged all the parties involved to initial
and sign the SPA and the CETA at their earliest convenience and to underline their complementarity.
Civil society: Members wanted to ensure that civil society and the main stakeholders are fully involved, informed and consulted in the process.
European Parliament: they asked for periodic reports on the implementation of the agreement to be provided Parliament. These should
present an overview of activities carried out and results achieved with regard to the different areas of the agreement.

2013/2133(INI) - 10/12/2013 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 509 votes to 111, with 39 abstentions a resolution containing the European Parliaments
recommendation to the Council, the Commission and the European External Action Service on the negotiations for an EU-Canada Strategic
Partnership Agreement (SPA).
Parliament recalled that the relations between the EU and Canada were built on shared interests and values formally dating back to 1976. The
SPA currently under negotiation would update and revitalise the relationship between the EU and Canada and considerably contribute to the
relations between the parties.
The SPA, beyond improving the institutional structure of relations, alongside the CETA, would provide Europes and Canadas citizens with
tangible benefits and opportunities as long as all stakeholders are involved in the process. The opening of markets and regulatory cooperation
is expected to generate important economic gains and have positive effects on employment for both Canada and the EU and, in light of
broadening the transatlantic partnership and given the existing NAFTA-framework, may lead to the creation of a transatlantic market, a win-win
situation for all actors involved as long as current social and environmental standards are not lowered.
In this context, Parliament addressed the following recommendations to the Council, the Commission and the European External Action
Service:
Conditionality clause: Parliament indicated that all EU agreements with third countries should include reciprocal conditionality and political
clauses on human rights and democracy, as a reaffirmation of the mutual commitment to these values and regardless of the state of protection
of human rights in those countries. Accordingly, it insisted that such conditionality should form part of the SPA with Canada, should ensure the
consistency of the EUs common approach on the matter.
Complementary nature of SPA and Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement: Parliament encouraged all the parties involved to initial
and sign the SPA and the CETA at their earliest convenience and to underline their complementarity.
Civil society: Members wanted to ensure that civil society and the main stakeholders are fully involved, informed and consulted in the process.
European Parliament: Parliament asked for periodic reports on the implementation of the agreement to be provided. These should present an
overview of activities carried out and results achieved with regard to the different areas of the agreement.
