2013/2208(DEC) - 10/09/2013 Court of Auditors: opinion, report
PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the European Centre for the Development of Vocational
Training (CEDEFOP) for the financial year 2012, together with the Centres reply.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit concerned, amongst others, the annual accounts of the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (CEDEFOP).
In the Courts opinion, the Centres Annual Accounts fairly present, in all material respects, its financial position as of 31 December 2012 and
the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions of its financial rules and the
accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
The Court also considers that the transactions underlying the annual accounts of the Centre for the financial year ended 31 December 2012
are, in all material respects, legal and regular.
The report confirms that the resources made available for the Agency in 2012 amounted to EUR 19.22 million.
The report also makes a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of the Centre, accompanied by the latters
response. The main observations may be summarised as follows:
The Courts comments:
internal controls: the Centre awards grants on an annual basis to a network of national partners. Grant expenditure in 2012 amounted
to nearly EUR 700 000, or 4 % of total operating expenditure. The Centres ex ante verifications of grants consist of a comprehensive
desk-analysis of cost claims submitted by grant beneficiaries, as well as a review of certificates obtained from external auditors which
were contracted by the beneficiaries or of certificates from independent public officers. However, the Centre does not usually verify the
staff costs claimed by beneficiaries on the basis of original supporting documentation. Related ex post verifications were last carried
out in 2009. As a result, ex ante verifications provide only limited assurance;
budgetary management: budget implementation rates were high at 100 %. While carry-overs of committed appropriations were also
high, this mainly resulted from reasons beyond the Centres control, such as delays in the repair works carried out by the Greek
authorities on the Centres premises;
recruitment: the Court stresses the issues as regards the recruitment procedure of the Centres Director.
The Centres replies:
internal controls: to address the Courts concerns, as of this year, Cedefop will introduce, in addition to the audit certificates, detailed
checks of personnel costs and time sheets for randomly selected cases of the grant payments;
recruitment: the Centre points out that even though it provides assistance to the pre-selection committee it has no control over the
procedure and the decisions of the pre-selection committee or Commission.
Lastly, the Court of Auditors report contains a summary of the Centres activities in 2012. This is focused on the following:
policy analysis and reporting: Cedefops report Trends in VET policy in Europe 2010-12: was published. It provided up-to-date
information on VET systems, along with news on initiatives and policy developments in the Member States;
common European tools, qualifications and learning outcomes: Cedefop coordinated the EQF (European Qualifications Framework)
Advisory Group jointly with the European Commission and (co) drafted 23 background papers that informed policy debates;
Europass website: has been increasingly used by Europes young people. Since its launch, almost 60 million visits have been recorded
(2012: 15 million; and users have generated 25 million CVs online (2012: 8.3 million);
adult learning and transitions: the study Adult learning in the workplace: skill development to promote innovation in enterprises was
issued for a workshop on this issue. To contribute to the European year of active ageing, Cedefop organised a workshop on sustaining
employability through learning within DG EACs conference One Step Up in later life;
skills analysis: Cedefop presented its latest EU skill demand and supply forecast for 2010-2020 in the briefing note Europes skill
challenge;
organisational impact: key performance indicators show high organisational impact: citations in 169 EU and 68 international policy
documents, some drawing substantially on Cedefops work; contributions to 26 EU policy documents, 158 Presidency and other EUlevel events; etc.

2013/2208(DEC) - 20/03/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading

grant discharge to the Director of the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop) in respect of the implementation
of the Centre's budget for the financial year 2012.

year 2012 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Members approved the closure of the Cedefops accounts.
They made, however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is granted, in addition to the
general recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies.
Role of the Centre: Members acknowledged the essential role of the Centre in the promotion of vocational education and training
(VET) in the Union and the relevance of its contribution to policies aimed at exploring VETs potential to support economic
development. They noted the presence of various stakeholders shows an increased demand for the Centres expertise and analytical

capacity.
Budget and financial management: Members noted that budget monitoring efforts during the financial year 2012 resulted in a budget
implementation rate of 99.68% and that the payment appropriations execution rate was 94.44%.
Commitments and carry-overs: they also noted that carry-overs of committed appropriations were high however they acknowledged
that this was mainly due to reasons beyond the Centres control.
Members also made a series of observations on transfers, procurement and recruitment procedures as well as comments on internal controls.
Lastly, they acknowledged that the Centre should assess its policy on the prevention and management of conflicts of interests on the basis of
the Commission's Guidelines on the issue. They called on the Centre to inform the discharge authority of the assessment results once
available.
