2013/0234(NLE) - 10/07/2013 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: the establishment of the Electronic Components and Systems for European Leadership (ECSEL) Joint Undertaking (JU).

PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to
follow its opinion.
BACKGROUND: in order to better align EU support for research and innovation with industrial goals and attract higher industrial investments
in Europe, Horizon 2020 provides for the setting-up of public-private partnerships in key areas where research and innovation could contribute
to Europes wider competitiveness goals and help tackle societal challenges. Micro- and nanoelectronics, and smart embedded components
and systems are priority fields identified within the ICT theme in Horizon 2020.
Europe is facing two main challenges in electronic components and systems, a sector that represents more than EUR 1 000 billion in turnover
worldwide. One is to be in control of the key elements of the value chain, (i.e. design, manufacturing and integration in final products), that are
essential to ensure the sustainability of value creation from electronics in Europe including the competitiveness of many other European
industrial sectors (automotive, energy, health, web industry, etc.). The other is to bridge important gaps in the innovation chains in order to
better transform research excellence into commercial successes. At the same time, Europe must cope with fierce global competition, declining
market shares of its industry, high costs of research and innovation and fast-paced technological development.
The ECSEL JU replaces the previous ENIAC and ARTEMIS JUs launched under the Seventh Framework Programme (2007-2013) which
respectively aimed at creating a Europe-wide research and development programme in the fields of nanoelectronics and embedded systems
with an incentive for industry, Member States and the European Union to align strategies and increase investments.
The JUs demonstrated that they can successfully play the role of catalyst for ambitious projects increasing the engagement of the private
sector champions in a framework in which national and European public authorities can support topics of high strategic value. In the period
2008-2012, a total research, development and innovation investment of EUR 2.8 billion was realised by some 2 000 participants of which over
500 are SMEs.
IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the proposal is accompanied by a summary of the impact assessment.
LEGAL BASIS: Articles 187 and 188 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
CONTENT: the new proposal for a public-private partnership (PPP) concerns a Joint Undertaking (JU) in the field of electronic components
and systems. The ECSEL (Electronic Components and Systems for European Leadership) JU replaces the previous ENIAC and ARTEMIS
JUs respectively in the fields of nanoelectronics and embedded computing systems launched under the Seventh Framework Programme.
The proposal lays down the objectives, the legal status, the operating rules and the statutes for the period 2014-2024 (and financial
programming up to 2020). The JUs headquarters would be in Brussels (Belgium).
The main specific objectives of this new JU include the following:
to contribute to the development of a strong and globally competitive electronics components and systems industry in the Union;
to align strategies with Member States to attract private investment and contribute to sound public finances by avoiding unnecessary
duplication and fragmentation of efforts;
to maintain and grow semiconductor and smart system manufacturing capability in Europe;
to secure a commanding position in design and systems engineering including embedded technologies;
to provide access for all stakeholders to a world-class infrastructure for the design and manufacture of electronic components and
embedded and smart systems;
to build a dynamic ecosystem involving innovative small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), strengthening existing clusters and
nurturing the creation of new clusters in promising new areas.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the indicative EU contribution is of EUR 1 215 255 000 at current prices (EFTA included) over the total lifetime
of the ECSEL JU (until 2024). This allocation would have to be committed before 21 December 2020, when the Horizon 2020 comes to an end
and paid by 31 December 2024.

2013/0234(NLE) - 31/01/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Industry, Research and Energy adopted, in the framework of a special legislative procedure (Parliament consultation), the
report by Paul RÜBIG (EPP, AT) on the proposal for a Council regulation on the ECSEL Joint Undertaking.
The committee approved the Commission proposal subject to the following amendments:
Establishment of a Joint Undertaking: for the implementation of the Joint Technology Initiative on ECSEL, a Joint undertaking, ECSEL,
(Electronic Components and Systems for European Leadership), should be established for a period from 1 January 2014 until 31 December
2024. In order to take account of the duration of Horizon 2020, all calls for proposals should be launched by 31 December 2020.
Objectives: the Joint Undertaking should: (i) ensure the availability of electronic components and systems for key markets and for addressing
societal challenges by bridging the gap between research and industrial and commercial exploitation; (ii) apply a simplified operating model
and simplification measures; (iii) promote the involvement of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
Scope of work: Members introduced a new article which aims to clarify the scope of activities of the ECSEL Joint Undertaking, in particular
with respect to the relevant Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) covered by its research programme. The rules of participation also call for a
greater consideration of the TRL-concept to stipulate funding levels, which is taken up in this article with a view to the funding rates used in
indirect actions.
Unions financial contribution: the maximum Union contribution, including contributions from member states of the European Free Trade
Association (EFTA), to the ECSEL Joint Undertaking to cover administrative costs and operational costs should be EUR 1 154 492 250
(compared to EUR 1 215 255 000 as proposed by the Commission).
The Union's financial contribution should be conditional upon proof by the ECSEL Joint Undertaking that its multiannual work plan and the
actions which it funds correspond to the research priorities laid down in the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme.

Staff: in exceptional circumstances, the Governing Board could, by motivated decision, decide to temporarily suspend the delegation of the
appointing authority powers to the Executive Director. In this case, the Governing Board should inform in writing the Commission and the
European Parliament on such decisions of suspension within 5 working days, provide detailed reasons and specify the implementing rules of
new or temporary provisions with regard to the management of the Joint Undertaking. The ECSEL Joint Undertaking should take appropriate
administrative measures, inter alia, through training and prevention strategies, to avoid conflicts of interest.
Evaluation: by 30 June 2017, the Commission should organise an independent interim evaluation of the ECSEL Joint Undertaking. The results
of the independent interim evaluation of the ECSEL Joint Undertaking shall be taken into account in the interim evaluation of Horizon 2020. In
order to respond to unforeseen situations or to new developments and needs the Commission may, following the interim evaluation of Horizon
2020, within the annual budgetary procedure, review the budget of the ECSEL Joint Undertaking.
The evaluation should pay specific attention to the impact on the accessibility of entities from Union Member States which are not members of
the ESCEL Joint Undertaking to funding under the ECSEL Joint Undertaking.
Discharge: Members proposed that the discharge for the implementation of the budget of the ECSEL Joint Undertaking should be given by the
European Parliament, upon recommendation of the Council.
Audits: the European Court of Auditors should regularly carry out audits not only of compliance but also of the performance of the Joint
Undertaking's activities and partners on the basis of documents or on-the-spot checks.
Anti-fraud measures: the amended text provides that the staff of the Joint Undertaking, the Executive Director and the members of the
Governing Board should, without delay and without any question of their responsibility being called into question as a result, notify OLAF of
any frauds which have come to their attention in the fulfilment of their duties or remit.

2013/0234(NLE) - 15/04/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 631 votes to 42, with 4 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a Council regulation on
the ECSEL Joint Undertaking.
