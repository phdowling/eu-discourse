Summary

The European Parliament adopted by 50 votes to 0 with 4 abstentions a resolution on recent violence in Iraq.
The resolution was tabled by the Greens/EFA, ECR, S&D, EPP, ALDE groups and Jaroslav Paka.
It strongly condemned the recent acts of terrorism and heightened sectarian violence, which carried the danger that the country would fall back
into sectarian strife and was generating fears of wider sectarian conflict across the region. It noted that, according to casualty figures released
by the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI), a total of 979 Iraqis were killed, and another 2 133 wounded, in acts of terrorism
and violence in September 2013, and that up to 5 000 civilians had been killed, since the beginning of 2013 the highest figure in the last five
years.
Members pointed out that although violence occurs along sectarian lines, its causes are political rather than religious. They called on all Iraqi
political leaders, from all ethnic and religious backgrounds, to work together to put an end to sectarian violence and distrust and to bring the
Iraqi people together. Both the Government of Iraq and the regional governments were asked to facilitate a full and swift independent
international investigation into the recent terrorist attacks in the region. Members also stated that they were concerned about the spill-over of
violence from the conflict in Syria to Iraq, where jihadist rebels linked to the Islamic State of Iraq, a Sunni militant umbrella group that included
al-Qaeda, had risen to prominence.
Parliament called on the international community and the EU to support the Iraqi Government by promoting initiatives for national dialogue,
consolidation of the rule of law and the provision of basic services, with the goal of creating a secure, stable, unified, prosperous and
democratic Iraq. Lastly, Parliament felt that the recent talks between the US and Iran also afforded an opportunity for Iraq to act as a bridge,
given that it was one of the few countries to have strong relations with both parties, and Members called on Iranian leaders to engage
constructively in the stabilisation of the region.
