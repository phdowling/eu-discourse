2013/2070(BUD) - 15/04/2013 Commission draft budget
PURPOSE: presentation of the Draft Amending Budget (DAB) No 3/2013 which is intended to budget the surplus resulting from the
implementation of the budget year 2012.
CONTENT: the present Draft Amending Budget (DAB) No 3/2013 seeks to budget the surplus resulting from the implementation of the budget
year 2012. As provided for in the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the Union, it is the only subject of this DAB and it
has to be submitted within 15 days following the submission of the provisional accounts, which took place at end March 2013.
Surplus: the implementation of the budget year 2012 shows a surplus of EUR 1 023 276 525.93 (not including contributions from European
Free Trade Association (EFTA) and European Economic Area (EEA)), which is therefore entered as revenue in the 2013 budget.
The budgeting of the surplus will diminish accordingly the global contribution of the Member States to the financing of the EU Budget. This
global decrease by Member State will also be influenced by the updated own resources forecast :
Traditional Own Resources (TOR),
Value Added Tax (VAT),
Gross National Income (GNI))
including the updated amount of the UK correction which will be available after the Advisory Committee on Own Resources (ACOR) meeting in
May 2013.

2013/2070(BUD) - 17/07/2013 Council position on draft budget
On 15 April 2013, the Commission submitted to the Council draft amending budget (DAB) No 3 to the general budget for 2013 concerning the
budgeting of the surplus resulting from the implementation of the budget year 2012.
The implementation of the budget year 2012 shows a surplus of EUR 1 023 276 525.93 resulting from:
an over-registering in revenue (+ EUR 719 million),
an under-spending of payment appropriations (+ EUR 244 million),
a positive balance of monetary exchange (+ EUR 60 million).
The budgeting of this surplus will diminish accordingly the global contribution of Member States to the financing of the EU budget.
On 9 July 2013, the Council adopted its position on draft amending budget No 3/2013 as set out in the technical annex to the explanatory
memorandum of this Council draft amending budget.

2013/2070(BUD) - 06/09/2013 Budgetary report tabled for plenary, 1st reading
The Committee on Budgets adopted the report by Giovanni LA VIA (EPP, IT) on the Council position on Draft amending budget No 3/2013 of
the European Union for the financial year 2013, Section III Commission.

Members recall that draft amending budget No 3/2013 aims to enter in the 2013 budget the surplus from the 2012 financial year, amounting to
EUR 1 023.3 million.
The main components of that surplus are:
an under-spend in expenditure of EUR 244.3 million,
a positive outturn on income of more than EUR 719.1 million,
a positive exchange rate difference of EUR 59.9 million.
Taking note of draft amending budget No 3/2013, which is devoted solely to the budgeting of the 2012 surplus, for an amount of EUR 1 023.3
million, Members recall that the adoption of this Draft amending budget will reduce the share of the GNI contribution from Member States to
the Union budget and therefore partly compensate their contribution to the financing of Amending budget No 2/2013.
At the same time, Members call on the European Parliament to approve, unamended, the Council position on Draft amending budget No
3/2013.

2013/2070(BUD) - 11/09/2013 Final act
PURPOSE: definitive adoption of amending budget No 3 of the European Union for the financial year 2013.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision 2013/689/EU, Euratom.
CONTENT: the European Parliament definitively adopted the amending budget 3/2013 of the European Union, in accordance with its
resolution of 11 September 2013 (please see the summary of the resolution.)
This amending budget aims to add to the 2013 budget the surplus resulting from the implementation of the budget year 2012 being EUR 1 023
276 525.93.
The budgeting of this surplus will diminish accordingly the global contribution of Member States to the financing of the EU budget as specified
in the final budgetary act (new division of Member States contributions to the EU budget, recalculated with the budgetisation of this surplus.)

2013/2070(BUD) - 11/09/2013 Budgetary text adopted by Parliament
The European Parliament adopted by 607 votes to 73, with 17 abstentions, a resolution on the Council position on Draft amending budget No
3/2013 of the European Union for the financial year 2013, Section III Commission.
Parliament recalls that draft amending budget No 3/2013 aims to enter in the 2013 budget the surplus from the 2012 financial year, amounting
to EUR 1 023.3 million.
The main components of that surplus are:
an under-spend in expenditure of EUR 244.3 million,
a positive outturn on income of more than EUR 719.1 million,
a positive exchange rate difference of EUR 59.9 million.
Taking note of draft amending budget No 3/2013, which is devoted solely to the budgeting of the 2012 surplus, for an amount of EUR 1 023.3
million, Parliament recalls that the adoption of this Draft amending budget will reduce the share of the GNI contribution from Member States to
the Union budget and therefore partly compensate their contribution to the financing of Amending budget No 2/2013.
At the same time, the European Parliament approves, unamended, the Council position on Draft amending budget No 3/2013.
