2013/2150(INI) - 30/01/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Fisheries and the Committee on Womens Rights and Gender Equality adopted a joint own-initiative report by Dolores
García-Hierro Caraballo (S&D, ES) and Raül Romeva i Rueda (Greens/EFA, ES) under Rule 51 of the Rules of Procedure on specific actions
in the Common Fisheries Policy for developing the role of women.
Members noted that more than 100 000 women worked in the fisheries sector in Member States, 4 % of them in the extractive sector and with
jobs linked to the activities of fishing boats, as net-makers, port workers or packers, 30 % in aquaculture, chiefly shellfish gathering on foot,
and around 60 % in the processing industry. However, the statistics grossly underestimated the reality of female work in some of these
sectors, and the widespread economic crisis in some Member States had led to a growing number of women engaging in activities in the
fishing sector, particularly land-based shellfish gathering, as a means of complementing or even ensuring their family income.
The report urged the Commission to launch a specific statistical programme for regions that depended on fishing, paying particular attention to
artisanal and coastal fishing, traditional fishing methods and specific marketing channels, and to the work and social and labour conditions of
women shellfish gatherers, net-makers and artisanal workers, with the aim of assessing the specific needs associated with womens activity
and enhancing the social recognition given to these extremely arduous occupations. The collection of gender-disaggregated data should also
covers the catch sector and new indicators should be introduced, such as age, education and training levels, and activity of spouse or partner.
Members called for:
·

legal and social recognition to the role played by women in the fisheries and aquaculture sector and in the sustainable development
of areas that depended on fishing, with the aim of removing all economic, administrative and social barriers that stand in the way of
their participation on equal terms;

·

regulation and recognition as occupational diseases injuries to joints, back injuries and rheumatic diseases caused by the harsh
weather conditions in which women shellfish gatherers, net-makers, processing workers, fishers and sellers have to work, as well as
injuries caused by lifting excessive weights;

·

the creation (under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund and/or other instruments) of specific support mechanisms that can be
activated in emergencies (natural disasters), as well as of financial compensation mechanisms to assist fishermen, fisherwomen and
their families during temporary fishing bans, especially in areas where fishing is the sole source of earnings;

·

financial support for the establishment of womens associations through national and European womens networks, in order to
facilitate the exchange of experience, and communicate womens needs and demands, from local government level up to European
bodies;

·

access to funding for womens organisations in fisheries, aquaculture and related sectors.

The European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) 2013-2020: Members noted that only one Member State had made use of the
opportunities offered by axis 4 of the European Fisheries Fund to finance projects whose beneficiaries were women. They urged Member
States to seize the opportunities offered by the EMFF in order to, inter alia:
·

apply the principle of equal opportunities to operational programmes;

·

make the fisheries sector more women-friendly by redesigning the sector and providing suitable facilities (such as changing-rooms
on vessels and in ports);

·

offer women and girls easier access to training by financing specific training and vocational education and professional recognition of
their activity;

·

promote business initiatives launched by women, including the economic diversification of certain activities related to the fisheries
sector, among them activities such as museology, cultural traditions, crafts, gastronomy and the restaurant industry;

·

facilitate soft loan channels that will make it possible to avoid the specific difficulties faced by women in relation to financing projects
eligible for inclusion in national programmes under the EMFF.

Basic regulation on the common fisheries policy: Member States were urged to:
·

ensure compliance with the objectives of the new common fisheries policy in relation to access to fishery resources based on
transparent environmental, social and economic criteria, incorporating the principles of equal treatment and equal opportunities;

·

recognise the occupational status of women in the event of temporary cessations of activity, including biological rest periods;

ensure compliance with Directive 2010/41/EU, so that women working full- or part-time in family businesses, as well as women who make their
livelihood from such activity without belonging to a family unit, are given legal recognition and social benefits equivalent to those enjoyed by
people with self-employed status.

2013/2150(INI) - 27/02/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 468 votes to 40, with 17 abstentions, a resolution on specific actions in the Common Fisheries Policy for
developing the role of women.

with jobs linked to the activities of fishing boats, as net-makers, port workers or packers, 30 % in aquaculture, chiefly shellfish gathering on

their families during temporary fishing bans, especially in areas where fishing is the sole source of earnings;
the recognition that the work carried out by women helps to improve the traceability of fishery products ;
financial support for the establishment of womens associations through national and European womens networks, in order to facilitate
the exchange of experience, and communicate womens needs and demands, from local government level up to European bodies;
access to funding for womens organisations in fisheries, aquaculture and related sectors.
