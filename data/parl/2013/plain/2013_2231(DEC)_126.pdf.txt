2013/2231(DEC) - 26/07/2013 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: presentation by the Commission of the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2012, as part of
the 2012 discharge procedure.
Analysis of the accounts of the (GSA).
CONTENT: this Commission document sets out the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2012 as
prepared on the basis of the information presented by the institutions, organisations and bodies of the EU, in accordance with Article 129 (2) of
the Financial Regulation applicable to the EU's General Budget, including the European GNSS Agency (GSA).
In 2012, the tasks and budget of this Authority were as follows:
description of the Authority's tasks: the GNSS Supervisory Authority was set up by Council Regulation (EC) No 1321/2004 and its
main task is to manage the public interests relating to the European GNSS programmes and to act as the regulatory authority for the
programme during the deployment and operational phases of the Galileo Programme. Regulation (EC) No 683/2008 of the European
Parliament and the Council reduced the responsibilities of the Authority to the control of the security of Galileo systems and to the
preparation of their commercialisation. In 2012, the GSAs headquarters was relocated to Prague, Czech Republic. Part of the GSA
staff remained located in Brussels awaiting relocation to other GSA sites in France and UK in 2013;
GNSS' budget for the 2012 financial year: the Authoritys budget for 2012, as presented in the Commission document on the
consolidated annual accounts of the European Union, gives the following figures:
§

Commitment appropriations :
- committed : EUR 106 million;
- paid : EUR 58 million;
- carried-over : EUR 47 million.

§

Payment appropriations :
- committed : EUR 55 million;
- paid : EUR 33 million;
- carried-over : EUR 22 million.

Please refer also to the final accounts of the GSA.

2013/2231(DEC) - 10/09/2013 Court of Auditors: opinion, report
PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the European GNSS Agency for the year 2012, together
with the Agencys reply.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit concerned, amongst others, the annual accounts of the European GNSS Agency.
In the Courts opinion, the European GNSS Agencys Annual Accounts fairly present, in all material respects, its financial position as of 31
December 2012 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions of its Financial
Regulation and the accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
The Court also considers that the transactions underlying the annual accounts of the Agency for the financial year ended 31 December 2012
are, in all material respects, legal and regular.
The report confirms that the Agencys 2012 budget amounted to EUR 20.8 million.
The report also makes a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of the Agency, accompanied by the latters
response. The main observations may be summarised as follows:
The Courts observations:
·

budgetary management: the Court notes that the overall level of committed appropriations was close to 100 % for all titles. However,
carry-overs of committed appropriations were relatively high for administrative expenditure at EUR 1.7 million euro (38 %). This was
partly due to events beyond the Agencys control, such as the relocation of its seat to Prague (EUR 0.4 million) and the setting-up of
the Galileo Security Monitoring Centre (EUR 0.4 million);

·

recruitment procedures: the Court identified weaknesses in the recruitment procedures.

The Agencys reply:
·

carry-overs: the Agency indicates that the major part of the carry-overs is related to the set up of the Galileo Security Monitoring
Centres in France and UK. As this is a complex project in terms of security, IT, logistics and legal support, the Agency has decided
to advance as much as possible the project preparations in 2012. In that respect, the Administrative Board approved a significant
transfer of credits in order to ensure that the necessary framework contracts are in place on time. Another significant part of the
carry-overs is related to the relocation of the Agencys headquarters from Brussels to Prague in September 2012;

·

recruitment: the Agency has revised the selection procedures.

Lastly, the Court of Auditors report contains a summary of the Agencys activities in 2012. This is focused on the following:
systems security (security accreditation of the systems and sites, Galileo system- specific security requirements, flight key cell
activities) ;
support for Public Regulated Service PRS (Preparation of the PRS User Segment)
preparation of Galileo Security Monitoring Centre GSMC ;
preparatory activities for EGNOS and Galileo exploitation ;
market development actions focused on receiver manufacturers to foster Galileo penetration in consumer and professional markets ;
research and development.

2013/2231(DEC) - 21/03/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Petri SARVAMAA (EPP, FI) in which it recommended the European Parliament to
grant discharge to the Executive Director of the European GNSS Agency in respect of the implementation of the Authority's budget for the
financial year 2012.
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the Agency for the financial
year 2012 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Members approved the closure of the Agencys accounts.
They made, however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is granted, in addition to the
general recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies.
Budget and financial management: Members noted that budget monitoring efforts during the financial year 2012 resulted in a budget
implementation rate of 100% and that the payment appropriations execution rate was 99.99%.
Commitments and carryovers: Members noted that the carry-over of committed appropriations was relatively high for administrative
expenditure at EUR 1.7 million (38%). This was partly due to events beyond the Authority's control, such as the relocation of its seat to
Prague in September 2012 (EUR 400 000) and the setting-up of the Galileo Security Monitoring Centre (EUR 400 000) which
necessitated the provision of certain goods and services in the last quarter of the year.
Prevention and management of conflicts of interests and transparency: Members regretted that the Agency did not answer
questionnaire on the management and prevention of conflicts of interests; urges the Agency to report to the discharge authority on the
actions it has implemented to become in line with the Court of Auditors' Special Report No 15/2012 and Parliament's
recommendations that all agencies develop and implement comprehensive independence policies and procedures, inter alia, by
establishing a breach of trust mechanism and clear penalties, or by changing those already in place.
Members also made a series of observations on transfers, procurement and recruitment procedures as well as comments on internal controls.
