OJ L 048 19.02.2014, p. 0009 Summary

2013/2255(BUD) - 03/10/2013 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: to mobilise the EU Solidarity Fund to assist Romania Germany, Austria and the Czech Republic affected by natural disasters in
2012 and 2013.
PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
CONTENT: the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 allows for the mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund, within an
annual ceiling of EUR 1 billion, over and above the relevant headings of the financial framework. The conditions of eligibility to the Fund are
detailed in Council Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002.
On the basis of an application for assistance from the Fund by Romania in relation to a drought and forest fires in summer 2012, and the
applications by Germany, Austria and the Czech Republic in relation to flooding in May and June 2013, the calculation of Solidarity Fund aid
based on the estimate of total damage caused is as follows:
Direct damage Romania (drought): EUR 806 724 312;
Direct damage Germany (flooding): EUR 8 153 500 000;
Direct damage Austria (flooding): EUR 866 462 000.
Direct damage Czech Republic (flooding): EUR 637 131 000.
Aid proposed: Romania: EUR 2 475 689; Germany: EUR 360 453 575; Austria: EUR 21 661 550; Czech Republic: EUR 15 928 275.
Total: EUR 400 519 089.
In the light of the examination of the applications, and considering the maximum possible grant from the Fund as well as the scope for
reallocating appropriations under the heading requiring additional expenditure, the Commission proposes to mobilise the European Union
Solidarity Fund for a total amount of EUR 400 519 089, to be allocated under heading 3b of
the financial framework.
By presenting this proposal to deploy the Fund, the Commission initiates the simplified trilogue procedure, as required by Point 26 of the
Inter-institutional Agreement of 17 May 2006, in view of securing the agreement of the two arms of the Budgetary Authority on the need to use
the Fund and the amount required. The Commission invites each arm of the budgetary authority to inform the other arm and the Commission
of its intentions.
In case of disagreement by either of the two arms of the Budgetary Authority, a formal trilogue meeting will be convened.
The Commission will present a draft amending budget (DAB) in order to enter in the 2013 budget specific commitment and payment
appropriations, as requested in Point 26 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006.

2013/2255(BUD) - 06/11/2013 Budgetary report tabled for plenary, 1st reading
