Summary

The European Parliament adopted a resolution expressing its deep concern at the situation in Egypt following the military intervention of 4 July
2013.
The resolution was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ECR, Greens/EFA and ALDE groups.
It underlines that power should be transferred to democratically-elected civilian authorities as soon as possible, and expresses its fundamental
solidarity with all those Egyptians who cherish democratic aspirations for their country. Members call for a rapid return to the democratic
process, including the holding of free and fair presidential and parliamentary elections in a fully inclusive process with the participation of all
democratic actors. The resolution follows the events of 4 July 2013, when the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces announced the
suspension of the constitution, the transfer of power to the head of the High Constitutional Court until early presidential elections are held, and
the forming of a national coalition government and a committee to look into amendments to the constitution.
