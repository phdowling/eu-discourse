PURPOSE: presentation by the Commission of the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2012, as part of
the 2012 discharge procedure.
Analysis of the accounts of the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE).
CONTENT: this Commission document sets out the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2012 as
prepared on the basis of the information presented by the institutions, organisations and bodies of the EU, in accordance with Article 129 (2) of
the Financial Regulation applicable to the EU's General Budget, including the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE).
In 2012, the tasks and budget of this agency were as follows:
description of the EIGEs tasks: the Institute, which is located in Vilnius, was established by Regulation (EC) No 1922/2006 of the European
Parliament and of the Council. The Institutes task is to : (i) collect, analyse and disseminate information as regards gender equality, (ii)
develop, analyse, evaluate and disseminate methodological tools in order to support the integration of gender equality into all Union policies
and the resulting national policies, (iii) raise awareness on all issues regarding this area;
the EIGEs budget for the 2012 financial year: the Institutes budget for 2012, as presented in the Commission document on the consolidated
annual accounts of the European Union, gives the following figures:
§

Commitment appropriations :
- committed : EUR 8 million;
- paid : EUR 7 million;
- carried-over : 0.

§

Payment appropriations :
- committed : EUR 11 million;
- paid : EUR 8 million;

2013/2236(DEC) - 10/09/2013 Court of Auditors: opinion, report

PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the European Institute for Gender Equality for the year
2012, together with the Institutes reply.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit concerned, amongst others, the annual accounts of the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE).
In the Courts opinion, the European Institute for Gender Equalitys Annual Accounts fairly present, in all material respects, its financial position
as of 31 December 2012 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions of its
Financial Regulation and the accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
The Court also considers that the transactions underlying the annual accounts of the Institute for the financial year ended 31 December 2012
are, in all material respects, legal and regular.
The report confirms that EIGEs 2012 budget amounted to EUR 7.7 million.
The report also makes a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of EIGE, accompanied by the latters response.
The main observations may be summarised as follows:
The Courts observations:
·

carryovers: the Institute has reduced the overall level of carry-overs of committed appropriations from 50 % in 2011 to 32 % in 2012.
The Institute does not have a formalised procurement planning and monitoring procedure. In particular, its Annual Work Programme
does not include a procurement schedule linked to the planned activities that would define the optimal scope and timing of
procurements;

·

recruitment: the Court identified shortcomings in the documentation of recruitment procedures. There is no evidence that questions
for written tests and interviews, as well as their respective weightings were prepared before the examination of the applications.

EIGEs reply:
·

carry-overs: the majority of the operational projects were finalised by the end of 2012. This led to carry-forward of appropriations up
to 60 % under the procurement of Title III (around EUR 2.1 million). In order to improve the procurement planning and monitoring
EIGE is creating a monitoring tool which follows the expected dates of each step of the annual procurement proceedings;

·

recruitment : EIGEs recruitment guidelines have been updated so that (i) an indicative maximum number of candidates to be placed
on the reserve list appears in the vacancy announcement of posts for temporary and contract staff and (ii) both the interview and test
questions are to be completed by the appointed selection committee before the review of any candidates takes place.

Lastly, the Court of Auditors report contains a summary of the Institutes activities in 2012. This is focused on the following:
·

comparable and reliable data and indicators on gender equality;

·

collecting and processing methods and good practices for gender equality work;

resource and documentation centre;
awareness-raising, networking and communication ;
studies, experts and working group meetings, organisation of international conference, and research reports.

2013/2236(DEC) - 21/03/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Petri SARVAMAA (EPP, FI) in which it recommended the European Parliament to
grant discharge to the Director of the European Institute for Gender Equality in respect of the implementation of the Institute's budget for the
financial year 2012.
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the Institute for the financial
year 2012 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Members approved the closure of the Institutes accounts.
They made, however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is granted, in addition to the
general recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies.
Budget and financial management: Members noted that budget monitoring efforts during the financial year 2012 resulted in a budget
implementation rate of 95.56% and that the payment appropriations execution rate was 63.95%. They acknowledged from the Institute
that in the third quarter of 2014, it plans to create budget monitoring guidelines, including control functions and deviations, in order to
ensure adequate monitoring and reporting of the budget implementation.
Commitments and carryovers: Members noted that the Institute has reduced the overall level of carry-overs of committed
appropriations from 50% in 2011. They pointed out that the carry-overs to 2013 amount to EUR 2.5 million and mainly concern
administrative expenditure. They noted that 7% of committed appropriations carried over from 2011 to 2012 had not been used and
had to be cancelled.
Members also made a series of observations on transfers, procurement and recruitment procedures as well as comments on internal controls.
Lastly, they acknowledged that the Institute's conflict of interests policy was presented to the Commission for consultation on 12 November
2013. They called on the Institute to inform the discharge authority of the results of that consultation and of the final adoption of its conflict of
interests policy.
