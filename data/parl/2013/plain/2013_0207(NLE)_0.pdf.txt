2013/0207(NLE) - 03/07/2015 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to subject 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole to control measures.
PROPOSED ACT: Implementing Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to
follow its opinion.
BACKGROUND: in compliance with Council Decision 2005/387/JHA on the information exchange, risk-assessment and control of new
psychoactive substances, the Scientific Committee of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) assessed the
risks on the new psychoactive substance 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole. The risk assessment report was subsequently submitted to the Commission
and to the Council on 16 April 2013.
The substance 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole is a synthetic derivative of indole substituted at the phenyl side of the indole ring system. It appears to
be a stimulant substance that may also have hallucinogenic effects. 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole has been found mostly in powder form but also in
tablet and capsule form. It is commercially available on the internet and from 'head shops', marketed as a 'research chemical'.
The existing information and data suggest that the acute toxicity of 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole can provoke adverse effects in humans.
There have been a total of 24 fatalities registered in four Member States from April to August 2012, in relation to which 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole
alone, or in combination with other substances, was detected in post-mortem samples.
Nine European countries have reported to the EMCDDA and to the European Police Office (Europol) that they reported detection of
5-(2-aminopropyl)indole.
Six Member States already control 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole by means of different types of legislative provisions.
The Risk Assessment Reports reveal that there is limited scientific evidence available on 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole and pointed out that further
research would be needed to determine the health and social risks that it poses.
However, the available evidence and information provides sufficient ground for subjecting 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole to control measures across
the Union. As a result of the health risks that it poses, as documented by its detection in several reported fatalities, of the fact that users may
unknowingly consume it, and of the lack of medical value or use, 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole should be subjected to control measures across the
Union.
CONTENT: this proposal aims to invite the Member States to subject the new psychoactive substance 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole to control
measures across the Union.
Decision 2013/496/EU ceases to produce effects from the date of entry into force of this Decision, without prejudice to the obligations of the
Member States relating to the time limit for subjecting 5(2-aminopropyl)indole to control measures and criminal penalties in their national laws.
The United Kingdom shall not take part in the adoption of this Decision and is not bound by it or subject to its application.

2013/0207(NLE) - 28/09/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading

The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs adopted the report by Teresa JIMÉNEZ-BECERRIL BARRIO (EPP, ES) on the
draft Council implementing decision on subjecting 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole to control measures.
The committee approved the Council draft which seeks to invite the Member States to subject 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole to control measures.
In compliance with Council Decision 2005/387/JHA on the information exchange, risk-assessment and control of new psychoactive
substances, the Scientific Committee of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) assessed the risks on the
new psychoactive substances. The risk assessment report was subsequently submitted to the Commission and to the Council on 16 April
2014.

2013/0207(NLE) - 06/10/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 656 votes to 5, with 33 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the draft Council implementing decision
on subjecting 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole to control measures.
In line with the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, the European Parliament approved the Council draft aiming to subject
5-(2-aminopropyl)indole to control measures.

2013/0207(NLE) - 08/10/2015 Final act
PURPOSE: to subject 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole to control measures.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1876 on subjecting 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole to control measures.
CONTENT: the Council adopted an implementing decision on subjecting the new psychoactive substance 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole to control
measures.
The substance 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole is a synthetic derivative of indole substituted at the phenyl side of the indole ring system. It appears to
be a stimulant substance that may also have hallucinogenic effects which has been detected in samples of a product sold as a legal high
called Benzo Fury, and in tablets resembling ecstasy.
The implementing Decision implements Decision 2005/387/JHA that confers upon the Council implementing powers with a view to giving a
quick and expertise-based response at Union level to the emergence of new psychoactive substances detected and reported by the Member
States, by subjecting those substances to control measures across the Union.
A risk assessment report on the new psychoactive substance 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole was drawn up in accordance with Decision
2005/387/JHA by the extended Scientific Committee of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA). The report
revealed that there is limited scientific evidence available on 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole and pointed out that further research would be needed to
determine the health and social risks that it poses.
However, as a result of the health risks that it poses, as documented by its detection in several reported fatalities, of the fact that users may
unknowingly consume it, and of the lack of medical value or use, 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole should be subjected to control measures across the
Union.
As of the day of entry into force of this Decision, Decision 2013/496/EU ceases to produce effects, without prejudice to the obligations of the
Member States relating to the time limit for subjecting 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole to control measures and criminal penalties in their national laws.
The United Kingdom is not bound by Decision 2005/387/JHA and is therefore not taking part in the adoption of this Decision, which
implements Decision 2005/387/JHA, and is not bound by it or subject to its application.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 21.10.2015.
