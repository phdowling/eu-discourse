Final legislative act with provisions for delegated acts

2013/0105(COD) - 15/04/2013 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to amend Directive 96/53/EC on the maximum authorised weights in road traffic vehicles, with the aim of reducing energy
consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, so as to adapt the legislation to technological developments and changing market needs and to
facilitate intermodal transport.

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council (amendment of Council Directive 96/53/EC).
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: it has become crucial to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the consumption of petroleum products in the field of
transport, and even more crucial for road transport, which accounts for 82% of the energy consumption of the transport sector. Furthermore,
the steady rise in the price of fuel prompts the need to identify solutions to reduce vehicle fuel consumption. In the light of the evolving market
and the technologies available, the question today is whether the choices made when the Directive was adopted in 1996 are still relevant.
The White Paper on Transport Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area Towards a competitive and resource efficient transport system
published in 2011 set a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 60% by 2050 in comparison with 1990 levels. In this context, the White
Paper announced the revision of the 1996 Directive, with the aim of allowing more energy- efficient, aerodynamic vehicles to be put on the
market.
IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the proposed measures are the result of public and sectoral consultations held in 2011 and 2012 and organized by
the Commission. They were examined in an impact assessment which looked at several options in terms of economic and environmental
efficiency.
The option selected combines technical harmonisation work conducted with a group of experts with a view to adopting delegated acts and a
moderate regulatory approach, in order to avoid imposing disproportionate or inapplicable obligations, which would penalise small and
medium-sized enterprises in particular.
LEGAL BASIS: Article 91 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
CONTENT: the Commission proposes to amend Directive 96/53/EC to improve the aerodynamics of vehicles and their energy efficiency, while
continuing to improve road safety, and within the limits imposed by the geometry of road infrastructures. Specifically, the proposal:
grants derogations from the maximum dimensions of vehicles for the addition of aerodynamic devices to the rear of vehicles or to
redefine the geometry of the cabs for tractors, improving drivers field of vision, and improving their safety and comfort. The
Commission will, with the assistance of a Committee, specify these requirements at a later stage;
authorises a weight increase of one tonne for vehicles with an electric or hybrid propulsion, to take account of the weight of batteries
or the dual motorisation, without prejudice to the load capacity of the vehicle. Furthermore, the maximum weight of buses will be
increased by a tonne to take account of various developments such as the increase in the average weight of passengers and their
baggage, of new equipment imposed by the safety regulations, and the new Euro VI class;
will facilitate the development of intermodal transport by allowing a derogation of 15 cm in the length of trucks carrying 45-foot
containers, which are increasingly used in intercontinental and European transport;
confirms that cross-border use of longer vehicles is lawful for journeys that only cross one border, if the two Member States concerned
already allow it and if the conditions for derogations under the Directive are met;
adds new provisions to enable the inspection authorities to better detect infringements and harmonise administrative penalties that
apply to them. The Commission will publish guidelines on inspection procedures to ensure harmonisation of inspection methods
between all Member States. The latter must carry out a minimum number of vehicle checks, using either weighing systems built into
the road or by means of onboard sensors in vehicles that communicate remotely with roadside inspectors. The Commission will define
the technical standards for onboard weighing devices that can communicate with the inspection authorities.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget.
In order to accelerate the introduction of vehicles that are more aerodynamic and have hybrid motorisation, the Commission will use the
budgets at its disposal, in particular those allocated to trans-European networks and the EU programmes for research, development and
innovation, to help industrial research, and equipping vehicle fleets.
DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of
the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

2013/0105(COD) - 27/03/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Transport and Tourism adopted the report by Jörg LEICHTFRIED (S&D, AT) on the proposal for a directive of the
European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 96/53/EC of 25 July 1996 laying down for certain road vehicles circulating within
the Community the maximum authorised dimensions in national and international traffic and the maximum authorised weights in international
traffic.
The committee recommended that Parliaments position in first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure should amend the
Commission position as follows:
Definitions: Members deleted the definition of electric vehicle and inserted the term low carbon technology, being technology which does not
fully rely on fossil oil sources in the energy supply to transport and which significantly contribute to the decarbonisation of transport. The
sources include: (i) electricity, (ii) hydrogen, (iii) synthetic fuels, (iv) advanced Biofuels, (v) natural gas, including biomethane, in gaseous form
(compressed natural gas CNG) and liquefied form (liquefied natural gas LNG), and (vi) waste heat.
The report specified that vehicles equipped with low-carbon technologies should be permitted to exceed the maximum weight by up to one
tonne, depending on the weight required for the technology. However, the extra weight should not increase the load capacity of the vehicle.
The principle of technological neutrality should be maintained.
Improve aerodynamic performance of vehicles: with the aim of improving the aerodynamic performance, vehicles or combinations of vehicles
equipped with devices that meet the relevant criteria may exceed the maximum lengths provided for in point 1.1 of Annex I by up to 500 mm.
Amongst the criteria referred to above were the following:
·

secure attachment of the devices in such a way as to ensure that there is no risk of their detachment;

·

day and night markings in accordance with type-approval rules on the installation of lighting and light-signalling devices;

·

a design which does not reduce the drivers visibility of the rear of the vehicle.

The exceedances of maximum lengths must allow the construction of tractor cabs improving the aerodynamic characteristics of vehicles or
combinations of vehicles, and improving road safety for vulnerable road users and vehicles involved in rear-end collisions.
The requirements for cabs must allow:
·

improvement of direct vision to make vulnerable road users more visible to the driver, in particular by reducing the blind spots under
the front windscreen and all around the cab, and, where necessary, by fitting additional equipment, such as mirrors and camera
systems;

·

reduction of the damage in the event of a collision with other vehicles and improves the energy absorption performance
by fitting of an energy absorbing crash management system;

·

improving pedestrian protection by adjusting the frontal design to minimise the risk of overruns in case of collisions with vulnerable
road users by encouraging the sideways diversion of vulnerable users.

The requirements for the comfort and safety of drivers to which drivers cabs must conform were:
·

compliance with the requirements set out in the Occupational Health and Safety Framework Directive 89/391/EEC, with its hierarchy
of prevention measure for the elimination of sources of whole-body vibration and of musculoskeletal disorders;

·

the provision of the drivers cab with safety features starting with a secure fire exit of the cab;

·

the increase in size of the drivers cab to adapt to comfort and safety requirements for drivers seats and couchettes taking into
account emergency situations.

Within seven years of the entry into force of the Directive new N2 and N3 vehicles and combination of vehicles shall use cabs that comply with
the safety requirements referred to in the directive.
Facilitate intermodal transport: by 2017, the Commission shall, if appropriate, make a legislative proposal to amend Directive 92/106/EEC and,
in particular, the existing definition of combined transport, in order to take into account the development of containerisation and in view of
facilitating the development of efficient intermodal transport.
Infringements and checks: Member States shall ensure that the information concerning the number and severity of any infringements of the
Directive that an individual undertaking had committed was introduced into the risk rating system established under Directive 2006/22/EC.
When identifying vehicles to be subject to checks, Members States may select as a priority vehicles operated by undertakings with a high-risk
profile. Vehicles may also be selected randomly for checks.
Report: the Commission should review Annex I to Directive 96/53/EC and report on its implementation, taking into account, inter alia, impacts
on international competition, modal split, costs of infrastructure adaption and the environmental and safety objectives of the European Union
as set in the 2011 White Paper on Transport.

2013/0105(COD) - 15/04/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 606 votes to 54 with 12 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a directive of the
European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 96/53/EC of 25 July 1996 laying down for certain road vehicles circulating within
the Community the maximum authorised dimensions in national and international traffic and the maximum authorised weights in international
traffic.
Parliaments position adopted in first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure amended the Commission proposal as follows:
Definitions: Parliament deleted the definition of electric vehicle and inserted the term low carbon technology, being technology which did not
fully rely on fossil oil sources in the energy supply to transport and which significantly contributed to the decarbonisation of transport. The
sources included: (i) electricity, (ii) hydrogen, (iii) synthetic fuels, (iv) advanced Biofuels, (v) natural gas, including biomethane, in gaseous form
(compressed natural gas CNG) and liquefied form (liquefied natural gas LNG), and (vi) waste heat.
Parliament specified that vehicles equipped with low-carbon technologies should be permitted to exceed the maximum weight by up to one
tonne, depending on the weight required for the technology. However, the extra weight should not increase the load capacity of the vehicle.
The principle of technological neutrality should be maintained.
Improve aerodynamic performance of vehicles: heavy-good vehicles were responsible for about 26 % of road transport CO2 emissions in
Europe while their fuel efficiency had hardly improved over the last 20 years.
With the aim of improving the aerodynamic performance, Parliament stated that vehicles or combinations of vehicles equipped with devices
that met the relevant criteria may exceed the maximum lengths provided for in point 1.1 of Annex I by up to 500 mm.
Amongst the criteria referred to above were the following:
·

secure attachment of the devices in such a way as to ensure that there is no risk of their detachment;

·

day and night markings in accordance with type-approval rules on the installation of lighting and light-signalling devices;

·

a design which does not reduce the drivers visibility of the rear of the vehicle.

The exceedances of maximum lengths must allow the construction of tractor cabs improving the aerodynamic characteristics of vehicles or
combinations of vehicles, and improving road safety for vulnerable road users and vehicles involved in rear-end collisions.
The requirements for cabs must allow:

·

improvement of direct vision to make vulnerable road users more visible to the driver, in particular by reducing the blind spots under
the front windscreen and all around the cab, and, where necessary, by fitting additional equipment, such as mirrors and camera
systems;

·

reduction of the damage in the event of a collision with other vehicles and improves the energy absorption performance
by fitting of an energy absorbing crash management system;

·

improving pedestrian protection by adjusting the frontal design to minimise the risk of overruns in case of collisions with vulnerable
road users by encouraging the sideways diversion of vulnerable users.

The requirements for the comfort and safety of drivers to which drivers cabs must conform were:
·

compliance with the requirements set out in the Occupational Health and Safety Framework Directive 89/391/EEC, with its hierarchy
of prevention measure for the elimination of sources of whole-body vibration and of musculoskeletal disorders;

·

the provision of the drivers cab with safety features starting with a secure fire exit of the cab;

·

the increase in size of the drivers cab to adapt to comfort and safety requirements for drivers seats and couchettes taking into
account emergency situations.

Within seven years of the entry into force of the Directive new N2 and N3 vehicles and combination of vehicles shall use cabs that comply with
the safety requirements referred to in the directive.
Facilitate intermodal transport: by 2017, the Commission shall, if appropriate, make a legislative proposal to amend Directive 92/106/EEC and,
in particular, the existing definition of combined transport, in order to take into account the development of containerisation and in view of
facilitating the development of efficient intermodal transport.
Infringements and checks: Member States shall ensure that the information concerning the number and severity of any infringements of the
Directive that an individual undertaking had committed was introduced into the risk rating system established under Directive 2006/22/EC.
When identifying vehicles to be subject to checks, Members States may select as a priority vehicles operated by undertakings with a high-risk
profile. Vehicles may also be selected randomly for checks.
Classification of infringements depending on their seriousness: the amended text stated that:
·

an overload of less than 2 % of the maximum authorised weight shall give rise to a written warning to the transport company, which
could give rise to a penalty, if the national legislation provides for this type of penalty ;

·

an overload of between 2 % and 10 % of the maximum authorised weight shall be considered as a minor offence and shall give rise
to a penalty ;

·

an overload of between 10 and 15 % of the maximum authorised weight shall be considered a serious infringement and give rise to a
penalty and the immediate immobilisation of the vehicle for unloading until it reaches the maximum authorised weight,

·

an overload of more than 15 % of the maximum authorised weight shall be considered a very serious infringement and give rise to an
immediate immobilisation of the vehicle for unloading until it reaches the maximum authorised weight, and to a penalty.

Report: by 2016, the Commission shall review Annex I to Directive 96/53/EC and submit a report on its implementation to the European
Parliament and the Council. On the basis of this report, it shall, if appropriate, make a legislative proposal duly accompanied by an impact
assessment. Following the review of the directive, the Commission shall submit a proposal by 1 January 2017, to mandate the safety
requirements for all new M2 and M3 vehicles.

2013/0105(COD) - 11/12/2014 Council position
The Council adopted its position at first reading on the proposed Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council
Directive 96/53/EC laying down for certain road vehicles circulating within the Community the maximum authorised dimensions in national and
international traffic and the maximum authorised weights in international traffic. The objective of this legislative initiative is to improve the
aerodynamics of vehicles and their energy efficiency while continuing to improve road safety and remaining within the limits imposed by the
geometry of road infrastructures.
The Council?s approach has been to introduce several amendments to the original proposal. The main provisions of the Directive have been
significantly amended. The Council's position at first reading, therefore, amends the original Commission proposal by redrafting it and adding
and deleting several provisions of the text. This means that the Council cannot accept the amendments introduced by the European
Parliament?s opinion at first reading in relation to those provisions.
The key policy issues are as follows:
Clarification on the cross-border traffic of longer vehicles: although the Commission proposes to modify the Directive 96/53/EC, the Council
takes the view that Directive 96/53/EC provides the appropriate balance between the right of Member States to explore and determine
transport solutions appropriate to their local circumstances, and the need to avoid distortions to the internal market and significant impact on
international competition. Council and Parliament have similar views on this issue.
Alternative fuels: in the same spirit of the Commission's proposal, the Council decided on an approach promoting the use of alternatively
fuelled vehicles. The list of alternative fuels that can already benefit from the additional weight required for the use of alternative fuels
(maximum of 1 tonne) may be updated by the Commission taking account of technological progress.
The European Parliament's approach is similar to the Council's approach on low-carbon technologies. Parliament?s amendments were taken
on board partially or in spirit.
Combined vs. intermodal transport: the Council shares the view that the use of intermodal transport as proposed in the context of the revision
of Directive 96/53/EC will favour transport by short sea shipping, by inland waterways as well as by rail, compared to the use of combined

transport as defined in Directive 92/106/EEC. Therefore, the Council included a definition of intermodal transport operation in the text for the
purposes of this Directive.
Moreover, the text provides for a derogation of 15 cm to the maximum length and the maximum distance between the axis of the fifth wheel
and the rear of a semi-trailer for vehicles transporting 45-foot containers in the context of an intermodal transport operation.
The Council did not follow the European Parliament who proposed to keep the definition of combined transport throughout the text and called
upon the Commission to submit a legislative proposal to amend Directive 92/106/EEC.
Aerodynamic devices at the rear of the vehicle and new cab design: in order to improve the aerodynamics of vehicles and, consequently, save
fuel, the Council's text allows for derogations to the maximum authorised lengths for vehicles or combinations of vehicles, if:
the vehicle or vehicle combination is equipped with aerodynamic devices at the rear;
the vehicle or vehicle combination is equipped with a cab that provides improved aerodynamic performance, energy efficiency and
improved safety.
The Council clarifies that aerodynamic devices must:
meet certain requirements to ensure safety in general and safety of intermodal transport operations;
be used in accordance with certain operational requirements that will be adopted by the Commission (implementing acts), and must
comply with the provisions of the type-approval Directive (Directive 2007/46/EC).
The Council decided to invite the Commission to develop the necessary technical requirements for the type-approval of vehicles equipped with
new cabs, under the type-approval Directive (2007/46/EC). Before being put on the market, those vehicles must be approved in accordance
with that Directive.
In the Council's text, the requirements for vehicles equipped with new cabs are not mandatory. The European Parliament envisages
mandatory requirements seven years after the entry into force of this Directive.
The Council?s position provides that vehicles equipped with aerodynamic devices or with new cabs must be able to turn within a swept circle
having an outer radius of 12.50 m and an inner radius of 5.30 m .
Moreover, the possibility given to exceed the maximum lengths for vehicles must not lead to an increase in the load capacity of those vehicles.
Parliament?s amendment was taken on board in spirit.
The European Parliament maintains the delegation of power to the Commission as envisaged in the Commission's proposal. Since the Council
decided on another approach, the Parliament?s amendments were not taken into consideration.
Enforcement: according to the Council's position on enforcement:
Member States must take specific measures to identify vehicles exceeding the authorised maximum weight six years from the date of
entry into force of this Directive;
checks on vehicle weight may be performed with the aid of automatic systems set up on the infrastructure or by means of onboard
weighing equipment;
Member States must not impose the installation of onboard weighing systems in vehicles registered in another Member State;
detailed technical specifications shall be established by implementing acts to ensure that onboard weighing systems are accurate,
reliable and fully interoperable.
The Council could not follow the Commission's approach in terms of categorisation of the infringements. The text was replaced by the
obligation for Member States to lay down rules on penalties applicable to the infringements envisaged in the Directive .
Reporting obligations: the Council streamlined the reporting obligations initially proposed by the Commission on the number of checks carried
out in the previous two calendar years and the number of overloaded vehicles detected.
Transposition date: the Council provides for a transitional regime of 36 months; the one initially envisaged by the Commission was 18 months.
Delegated acts/implementing acts: the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts to update, for the purposes of this Directive,
the list of alternative fuels referred to in the Directive that require additional weight. However, the Council decided to modify the delegation of
power to the Commission (replacing delegated acts with implementing acts) for rear flaps, new cabin design and establishment of the technical
specifications for interoperability.

2013/0105(COD) - 12/01/2015 Commission communication on Council's position
The Commission considered that the Council position supports the main objectives of the Commission proposal of enabling the design of
greener and safer trucks, while deviating on some other aspects, in particular:
considerable timeframes are proposed both for the transposition of the new Directive (3 years) and for the implementation of the
provisions of its Article 9 on the design of new cabs (5 years after the necessary modification of Directive 2007/46, including its
implementing acts), in order to accommodate the capacity of investment of some vehicle manufacturers. In the Commission proposal,
a transposition period of 18 months was provided for;
the enforcement pillar proposed by the Commission to sanction infringements of overweight, has largely been rejected by the Council
which deleted Article 13 on categorisation of infringements and watered down Article 12 on enforcement. The Council however agreed
that Member States have to report to the Commission on the number of checks and infringements;
implementing powers of the Commission (comitology), the Council invokes Article 5, paragraph 4, second subparagraph, point (b) of
Regulation 182/2011 ("no opinion-clause"). The Commission made a statement recalling that recourse to this provision must not be
made systematically but must be interpreted in a restrictive manner and thus must be justified.
On the other hand, the Commission welcomes the following points:

measures on aerodynamic features have kept the drafting proposed by the Commission in terms of both objective and content.
Despite the fact that the Council replaces the proposed delegated acts by implementing acts, the Commission can agree to this
approach;
the introduction of joint liability between shipper and haulier for the transport of containers;
the adoption of a new definition of the intermodal transport operation which appropriately addresses the specificity of waterborne
transport;
the fact that the Council has increased to 19.5 tonnes the weight allowed for 2-axle buses (500 kg more than the weight set forward in
the Commission proposal).
With regard to cross-border traffic of longer vehicles, the Commission takes note of the diverging opinions between Member States, and of the
decision of the Council not to modify the text of the current Directive.
For these reasons, the Commission considers that it would be contrary to the interests of the Union citizens to wait for a number of years
before manufacturers introduce the new designs, which are, to a large extent, ready for deployment. The Commission is of the view that those
issues deserve to be addressed during the negotiations between the co-legislators.

2013/0105(COD) - 02/03/2015 Committee recommendation tabled for plenary, 2nd reading
The Committee on Transport and Tourism adopted the recommendation for second reading contained in the report by Jörg LEICHTFRIED
(S&D, AT), on the Council position at first reading with view to the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council
amending Council Directive 96/53/EC laying down for certain road vehicles circulating within the Community the maximum authorised
dimensions in national and international traffic and the maximum authorised weights in international traffic.
The committee recommended that the European Parliament should amend the Councils position in first reading as follows:
Intermodal transport operation: the definition should cover:
the combined transport operations defined in Article 1 of Council Directive 92/106/EEC engaged in the transport of one or more containers or
swap bodies, up to a total maximum length of 45 feet, or transport operations engaged in the transport of one or more containers or swap
bodies, up to a total maximum length of 45 feet, using waterborne transport, provided that the length of the initial or the final road leg does not
exceed 150 km in the territory of the Union.
Aerodynamic devices: these shall fulfil the following operational conditions:
·

in circumstances where the safety of other road users or of the driver is at risk, they shall be folded, retracted or removed by the
driver;

·

their use on urban and inter urban road infrastructures shall take into account the special characteristics of areas where the speed
limit is less than or equal to 50 km/h and where vulnerable road users are more likely to be present; and

·

their use shall be compatible with intermodal transport operations and, in particular, when retracted/folded, they shall not exceed the
maximum authorised length by more than 20 cm.

On-board weighing equipment: this shall be accurate and reliable, fully interoperable and compatible with all vehicle types.
One year after the date of entry into force of the Directive, the Commission shall adopt implementing acts, laying down detailed provisions
ensuring uniform conditions for the implementation of the rules on interoperability and compatibility.
In order to ensure compatibility with all vehicle types, on-board systems of motor vehicles shall have the capability to receive and process any
data coming from any type of trailer or semi-trailer attached to the motor vehicle.
Review: the Commission should review the Directive 3 years after national rules are in place, taking into consideration certain market
segments such as car transporters. Any legislative proposal must be duly accompanied by an impact assessment.

2013/0105(COD) - 10/03/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, 2nd reading
The European Parliament adopted a legislative resolution on the Council position at first reading with view to the adoption of a directive of the
European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 96/53/EC laying down for certain road vehicles circulating within the
Community the maximum authorised dimensions in national and international traffic and the maximum authorised weights in international
traffic.
Parliaments position adopted at second reading of the ordinary legislative procedure amended the Councils position as follows:
Intermodal transport operation: the definition should cover:
·

the combined transport operations defined in Article 1 of Council Directive 92/106/EEC engaged in the transport of one or more
containers or swap bodies, up to a total maximum length of 45 feet, or;

·

transport operations engaged in the transport of one or more containers or swap bodies, up to a total maximum length of 45 feet,
using waterborne transport, provided that the length of the initial or the final road leg does not exceed 150 km in the territory of the
Union.

Aerodynamic devices: improved aerodynamics of the cabs of motor vehicles would allow significant gains in respect of the energy
performance of vehicles. Parliament stipulated that the aerodynamic devices shall fulfil the following operational conditions:
·

in circumstances where the safety of other road users or of the driver is at risk, they shall be folded, retracted or removed by the
driver;

·

their use on urban and inter urban road infrastructures shall take into account the special characteristics of areas where the speed
limit is less than or equal to 50 km/h and where vulnerable road users are more likely to be present; and

·

their use shall be compatible with intermodal transport operations and, in particular, when retracted/folded, they shall not exceed the
maximum authorised length by more than 20 cm.

On-board weighing equipment: this shall be accurate and reliable, fully interoperable and compatible with all vehicle types.
One year after the date of entry into force of the Directive, the Commission shall adopt implementing acts, laying down detailed provisions
ensuring uniform conditions for the implementation of the rules on interoperability and compatibility.
In order to ensure compatibility with all vehicle types, on-board systems of motor vehicles shall have the capability to receive and process any
data coming from any type of trailer or semi-trailer attached to the motor vehicle.
Infringements in relation to overloaded vehicles: these need to be addressed adequately by Member States in order to avoid any distortions of
competition and to ensure road safety.
Review: the Commission shall review the Directive 3 years after national rules are in place, taking into consideration certain market segments.
On the basis of that report, the Commission shall, if appropriate, make a legislative proposal duly accompanied by an impact assessment.

2013/0105(COD) - 13/04/2015 Commission opinion on Parliament's position at 2nd reading
The Commission accepts all the amendments to the position adopted by the Council and voted upon by the European Parliament in second
reading.
The text is the result of negotiations between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission. Its objective is to make HGVs and
buses greener and safer by authorising weights and dimensions which exceed current limits in certain cases and under determined conditions,
where improvements are currently not feasible with the limitations set out by the Directive in its current version.

2013/0105(COD) - 29/04/2015 Final act
PURPOSE: to improve the aerodynamics of vehicles and their energy efficiency, while continuing to improve road safety.
LEGISLATIVE ACT : Directive (EU) 2015/719 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2015 amending Council Directive
96/53/EC laying down for certain road vehicles circulating within the Community the maximum authorised dimensions in national and
international traffic and the maximum authorised weights in international traffic
CONTENT: The main objective of the Directive is to make HGVs and buses greener and safer by authorising weights and dimensions which
exceed current limits in certain cases and under determined conditions, where improvements were not feasible with the limitations set out by
the Directive 96/53/EC in its previous version.
Improve aerodynamism: the Directive makes provision for granting derogations on vehicle length so as to allow rear flaps to be attached to the
vehicle or the front of the vehicle to be redesigned to create a more aerodynamic shape. It aims to allow the installation of such devices as
soon as the necessary amendments to the technical requirements for type approval of the aerodynamic devices are transposed or applied and
the Commission has adopted implementing acts laying down the operational rules for the use of such devices.
In the same way, in order to improve the aerodynamic performance of cabs, maximum lengths of lorries may be exceeded provided that their
cabs deliver improved aerodynamic performance, energy efficiency and safety performance.
Aerodynamic devices exceeding 500 mm in length and motor vehicles equipped with cabs that improve their aerodynamic performance, where
such vehicles exceed the limits set by Directive 96/53/EC, are to be type approved before being placed on the market.
Clean fuels: the Directive promotes the use of clean fuels by authorising a weight increase of one tonne for alternatively fuelled vehicles, to
take account of the weight required for the alternative fuel technology.
Containerisation and facilitating intermodal transport operations: in the area of containerisation, 45-foot containers are increasingly being used.
Such containers are transported by all modes of transport. The Directive provides for:
an increase of 15cm for vehicles engaged in the transport of 45-foot containers that are part of an intermodal transport operation;
the circulation of three-axle motor vehicles with two- or three-axle semi-trailers will be allowed up to a total authorised weight of 44
tonnes;
two-axle motor vehicles with three-axle semi-trailers transporting containers or swap bodies of a length of up to 45 feet will be allowed
in intermodal transport operations up to a total authorised weight of 42 tonnes.
Buses: the Directive authorises an additional tonne for buses, in order to take account of the increase in the weight of passengers and their
luggage.
Provisions regarding application: Member States should, by 27 May 2021, take specific measures to identify vehicles or vehicle combinations
in circulation that are likely to have exceeded the relevant weight limits and that should therefore be checked. Such identification may be
carried out by means of weighing mechanisms built into the road infrastructure, or by means of on-board sensors in vehicles that communicate
data remotely to the relevant authorities.
Every year, each Member State should perform an appropriate number of vehicle weight checks that should be proportionate to the total
number of vehicles inspected each year in the Member State concerned.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 26.5.2015.
TRANSPOSITION: 7.5.2017.

DELEGATED ACTS: the Commission may adopted delegated acts in order to update the list of alternative fuels included in the Directive in
light of the latest technological developments. The power to adopt such acts is conferred on the Commission for a period of five years (which
may be tacitly extended) from 26 May 2016. The European Parliament or the Council may raise objections to a delegated act within two
months of the date of notification of that act (which period may be extended for two months). If Parliament or Council raise objections, the
delegated act will not enter into force.
