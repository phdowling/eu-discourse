2013/2241(DEC) - 10/09/2013 Court of Auditors: opinion, report
PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the Office of the Body of European Regulators for
Electronic Communications (BEREC) for the year 2012, together with the Offices reply.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit concerned, amongst others, the annual accounts of the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC).
In the Courts opinion, BERECs Annual Accounts fairly present, in all material respects, its financial position as of 31 December 2012 and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions of its Financial Regulation and the
accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
The Court also considers that the transactions underlying the annual accounts of the Office for the financial year ended 31 December 2012
are, in all material respects, legal and regular.
The report confirms that the Offices 2012 budget amounted to EUR 3.1 million.
The report also makes a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of the Office, accompanied by the latters
response. The main observations may be summarised as follows:
The Courts observations:
carried-over commitments: the level of carryovers of committed appropriations to 2013 was high at EUR 611 000 or 19 % of the total,
indicating difficulties in the planning of the Offices activities. Some EUR 101 000, 45 % of the committed appropriations carried over
from 2011, were cancelled ;
recruitment : the recruitment procedures examined revealed significant shortcomings affecting transparency.
The Offices reply:
to address the situation of commitments being carried forward irregularly, the Office has undertaken the development of a financial
manual, which will address, the definition, conditions, follow-up procedure and the corresponding workflow inside the organisation that
will be implemented for the carry-forward exercise to be performed at the end of the year ;
as of 2013, the recruitment procedures? consistency is ensured by the Human Resources team in the Office through policies and
guidelines.
Lastly, the Court of Auditors report contains a summary of the Offices activities in 2012. This is focused on the following:
professional and administrative support services to BEREC ;
collection of information from NRAs and exchange and transmission of information ;
dissemination of regulatory best practices among NRAs within the EU and to third parties ;
assistance to the Chair in the preparation of the work of the Board of Regulators and the Management Committee of the Office ;
support to the Expert Working Groups set up by the Board of Regulators.

2013/2241(DEC) - 05/02/2014 Document attached to the procedure
Having examined the revenue and expenditure accounts for the financial year 2012 and the balance sheet at 31 December 2012 of the Office
of the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC), as well as the Court of Auditors' report on the annual accounts
of the Office for the financial year 2012, accompanied by the Office's replies to the Court's observations, the Council recommends the
European Parliament to give a discharge to the Management Committee of the Office in respect of the implementation of the budget for the
financial year 2012.
The observations in the Court of Auditors' report in relation to the financial year 2012 call for some comments by the Council, which may be
summarised as follows:
in general, the Council welcomes the Court's opinion that, in all material respects, the Office's annual accounts present fairly its financial
position as at 31 December 2012 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions
of the Office's Financial Regulation and the accounting rules adopted by the Commission's accounting officer, and that the underlying
transactions for that financial year are legal and regular.
Carry-overs: notwithstanding this favourable opinion, the Council regrets, however, that certain appropriations were carried over
without an existing legal commitment and urges the Office to remedy the situation in compliance with the Financial Regulation.
Controls: the Council urges the Office to complete its internal control procedures, to implement a number of Internal Control Standards
and to put in place procedures related to the inventory management and the management of exceptions and deviations from policies

and procedures. In line with the budgetary principle of annuality, the Council also calls on the Office to continue to improve its financial
programming and monitoring of the budget implementation, in order to reduce the level of commitments carried over and amounts
cancelled at the end of the following year to the minimum necessary.
Procurement: furthermore, the Council encourages the Office to take actions to remedy the weaknesses found by the Court in the
management of its procurement procedures, the transparency of the Office's recruitment procedures and the control of mobile
communication expenses.
Treasury: lastly, the Council expects the Office to take the necessary measures in terms of implementation of a sound treasury policy.

2013/2241(DEC) - 20/03/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Petri SARVAMAA (EPP, FI) in which it recommended the European Parliament to
postpones its decision on granting the Administrative Manager of the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications discharge
in respect of the implementation of the Bodys budget for the financial year 2012. In parallel, Members postponed the closure of the Bodys
accounts and made a number of recommendations in addition to those that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial
management and control of EU agencies.
Legality and regularity of transactions: Members regretted that the Bodys accounting system has been validated in 2013. They called
on the Body to take steps in order to avoid such situations in the future and to report on the steps taken by 1 September 2014.
Members regretted that the committed appropriations carried over, amounting to EUR 61.5 million (10% of the total committed
appropriations carried over), did not correspond to legal commitments and were thus irregular.
Budget and financial management: Members noted with concern that budget monitoring efforts during the financial year 2012 resulted
in a budget implementation rate of 63.4% and that the payment appropriations execution rate was 66.16%.
Commitments and carryovers: Members also regretted that 45% of the committed appropriations carried over from 2011 were
cancelled and that appropriations of EUR 545 000 were not used and had to be cancelled. They are worried that the level of
carry-overs of committed appropriations to 2013 was high at EUR 611 000. They believed that this indicates difficulties in the planning
and/or implementation of the Bodys activities.
Recruitment procedures: Members regretted that the recruitment procedures examined showed significant shortcomings affecting
transparency, namely that questions for written tests and interviews were set after the applications had been examined by the
selection board. Improvements should be made in this area.
Conflicts of interests: Members regretted that the Body has provided limited information regarding conflicts of interests policy. They
noted that personal conflicts of interests declarations are requested from the members of the Body's Management Committee and the
Board of Regulators, as well as from their staff members. They called on the Body to inform the discharge authority of whether it plans
to review its conflict of interests arrangements on the basis of the Commission's Guidelines on the Prevention and Management of
Conflict of Interests in EU Decentralised Agencies.
Members also made a series of observations on transfers, procurement and recruitment procedures as well as comments on internal controls.
