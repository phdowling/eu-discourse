2013/2089(INL) - 16/07/2013 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety unanimously adopted the own-initiative report by Matthias GROOTE
(S&D, DE) with recommendations to the Commission on Parliament's rights in the appointment procedure of future Executive Directors of the
European Environment Agency amendment of Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 401/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the
European Environment Agency and the European Environment Information and Observation Network.
The initiative report is presented in accordance with Rule 42 of the European Parliaments Rules of Procedure in which the Parliament may
request the Commission, pursuant to Article 225 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, to submit to it any appropriate
proposal for the adoption of a new act or the amendment of an existing act, by adopting a resolution on the basis of an own-initiative report
drawn up by the committee responsible.
To recall, the first subparagraph of Article 9(1) of Regulation (EC) No 401/2009 on the European Environment Agency and the European
Environment Information and Observation Network includes no provision granting the European Parliament a formal right to hear the candidate
selected to be appointed Executive Director of the European Environment Agency prior to his or her appointment. This requirement is present
in the regulations establishing other agencies of the same kind but does not appear in this Regulation due to the fact that the Regulation
establishing the EEA is older than the other regulations, dating back (in its original version) to 1990.
It is therefore necessary to update and align the EEA Regulation to more recent practice as regards the appointment of the Executive Director
in order to grant the European Parliament the formal right to hear the candidate selected to be appointed Executive Director of the European
Environment Agency.
The motion for a resolution requests the Commission to submit as soon as possible, a proposal for an act amending Regulation (EC) No
401/2009, following the detailed recommendations set out in the Annex hereto:
Amendment to Article 9(1) of Regulation (EC) No 401/2009, the first subparagraph: the text states that the Agency shall be headed by an
Executive Director appointed by the Management Board on the basis of a list of candidates proposed by the Commission following a call for
expressions of interest published in the Official Journal of the European Union and in other periodicals or on internet sites.
Before being appointed, the candidate selected by the Management Board shall be invited as soon as possible to make a statement before the
European Parliament and to answer questions from its Members.
In advance of that hearing, which is to take place in the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety committee, the candidate shall provide a
written roadmap that encompasses his or her strategy for their five-year term of office.

2013/2089(INL) - 11/09/2013 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a resolution with recommendations to the Commission on Parliament's rights in the appointment procedure
of future Executive Directors of the European Environment Agency amendment of Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 401/2009 of the European
Parliament and of the Council on the European Environment Agency and the European Environment Information and Observation Network.
The initiative report is presented in accordance with Rules 42 and 48 of the European Parliaments Rules of Procedure in which the Parliament
may request the Commission, pursuant to Article 225 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, to submit to it any appropriate
proposal for the adoption of a new act or the amendment of an existing act, by adopting a resolution on the basis of an own-initiative report
drawn up by the committee responsible.
To recall, the first subparagraph of Article 9(1) of Regulation (EC) No 401/2009 on the European Environment Agency and the European
Environment Information and Observation Network includes no provision granting the European Parliament a formal right to hear the candidate
selected to be appointed Executive Director of the European Environment Agency prior to his or her appointment. This requirement is present
in the regulations establishing other agencies of the same kind but does not appear in this Regulation due to the fact that the Regulation
establishing the EEA is older than the other regulations, dating back (in its original version) to 1990.

It is therefore necessary to update and align the EEA Regulation to more recent practice as regards the appointment of the Executive Director
in order to grant the European Parliament the formal right to hear the candidate selected to be appointed Executive Director of the European
Environment Agency.
Consequently, this resolution requests the Commission to submit as soon as possible, a proposal for an act amending Regulation (EC) No
401/2009, following the detailed recommendations as follows:
Principles: the aim of this proposal is to align the procedure for appointment of the Executive Director of the European Environment Agency
with the procedures in use for the Executive Directors of other agencies, such as the European Chemicals Agency, the European Medicines
Agency and the European Food Safety Authority, in particular in order to grant the European Parliament the formal right to hear the candidate
selected by the Management Board of the European Environment Agency for the post prior to his or her appointment
Amendment to Article 9(1) of Regulation (EC) No 401/2009, the first subparagraph: the text states that the Agency shall be headed by an
Executive Director appointed by the Management Board on the basis of a list of candidates proposed by the Commission following a call for
expressions of interest published in the Official Journal of the European Union and in other periodicals or on internet sites.
Before being appointed, the candidate selected by the Management Board shall be invited as soon as possible to make a statement before the
European Parliament and to answer questions from its Members.
In advance of that hearing, which is to take place in the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety committee, the candidate shall provide a
written roadmap that encompasses his or her strategy for their five-year term of office.
