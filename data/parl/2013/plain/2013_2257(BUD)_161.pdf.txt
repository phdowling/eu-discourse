2013/2257(BUD) - 03/10/2013 Commission draft budget
PURPOSE: presentation of Draft Amending Budget (DAB) No 9 for the year 2013 to cover the mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund in favour
of Romania, Germany, Austria and the Czech Republic affected by natural disasters in 2012 and 2013.
CONTENT: this Draft Amending Budget (DAB) No 9 for the year 2013 covers the mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund for an amount of EUR
400.5 million in commitment and payment appropriations. The mobilisation is in favour of Romania in relation to a drought and forest fires in
summer 2012, and of Germany, Austria and the Czech Republic in relation to flooding in May and June 2013.
After thorough examination of the cases, the Commission considered that:
as regards Romania: the drought and wildfires may be considered to be a major disaster within the meaning of the Regulation and to
meet the conditions set out by Article 2(2), first subparagraph, of Regulation 2012/2002 for mobilising the Solidarity Fund;
as regards Germany, Austria and the Czech Republic: the flooding referred to in each application is considered to be a disaster in a
neighbouring country within the meaning of the Regulation and to meet the conditions set out by Article 2(2), second subparagraph, of
Regulation 2012/2002 for mobilising the Solidarity Fund.
Financing: the total annual budget available for the Solidarity Fund is EUR 1 000 million. As solidarity was the central justification for the
creation of the Fund, the Commission takes the view that aid from the Fund should be progressive. That means that, according to previous
practice, the portion of the damage exceeding the threshold (0.6% of the GNI or EUR 3 billion in 2002 prices, whichever is the lower amount)
should give rise to higher aid intensity than damage up to the threshold. The rate applied in the past for defining the allocations for major
disasters is 2.5 % of total direct damage under the threshold for mobilising the Fund and 6 % above.
It is proposed to mobilise the Solidarity Fund as follows:
Romania - drought: EUR 806 724 312 in approved direct damages: EU aid : EUR 2 475 689
Germany - flooding: EUR 8 153 500 000 in approved direct damages: EUR aid: EUR 360 453 575
Austria - flooding: EUR 866 462 000 in approved direct damages: EUR 21 661 550
Czech Republic - flooding: EUR 637 131 000 in approved direct damages: EUR aid 15 928 275.
Total: EUR 400 519 089.
In conclusion, it is proposed to accept the applications submitted by Romania relating to the drought disaster in 2012 and by Germany, Austria
and the Czech Republic relating to the flooding disasters of May and June 2013 and to propose the mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund for each
of these cases.

2013/2257(BUD) - 30/10/2013 Council position on draft budget
On 3 October 2013, the Commission submitted to the Council draft amending budget (DAB) No 9/2013. It concerns the mobilisation of the EU
Solidarity Fund (EUSF) for an amount of EUR 400.5 million in commitment and payment appropriations in order to provide financial assistance
to Germany, Austria and the Czech Republic (floods in May and June 2013) and to Romania (drought and forest fires in summer 2012).
The Council accepted the mobilisation of the EUSF in commitment appropriations as proposed by the Commission. In order to be able to
respect the global ceiling in payment appropriations, the Council decided to finance the requested payment appropriations by redeployments
from the following budget lines:
Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance for Rural Development (IPARD): EUR -32 331 335;
Euratom - European Joint Undertaking for ITER - Fusion for Energy (F4E): EUR -289 200 000;
Instrument for Structural Policies for Pre-accession (ISPA) - Completion of other previous projects (2000 to 2006): EUR -78 987 754.
TOTAL: EUR -400 519 089.
On 30 October 2013, the Council adopted its position on DAB No 9/2013 on the basis of the elements recorded above, as set out in the
technical annex to this explanatory memorandum to this draft Council document.

2013/2257(BUD) - 15/11/2013 Budgetary report tabled for plenary, 1st reading
The Committee on Budgets adopted the report by Giovanni LA VIA (EPP, IT) on the Council position on Draft amending budget No 9/2013 of
the European Union for the financial year 2013, Section III Commission.
The report recalled that Draft amending budget (DAB) No 9 for the year 2013 covers the mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund for an amount
of EUR 400.5 million in commitment and payment appropriations, in favour of:
Romania in relation to the drought and forest fires in summer 2012,
Germany, Austria and the Czech Republic in relation to flooding in May and June 2013.
The purpose of DAB No 9/2013 is to formally enter this budgetary adjustment into the 2013 budget.
Members took note of DAB No 9/2013, as submitted by the Commission and called on the Council to cease presenting its positions under
Article 314(3) TFEU in the form of legal acts (Decision), since this is not in conformity with Article 314 TFEU. They recalled that a position
under Article 314(3) TFEU is a preparatory act and is valid as from its date of adoption.
They stressed that they would reject and ignore any clause by which the Council purports to make the validity of its position in a budgetary
procedure conditional on the prior approval by the Parliament of a different budget, amending budget or legislative act.
Furthermore, they deplored Councils position on DAB No 9/2013, which amends the Commissions proposal with a view to fully finance the
mobilisation of the Fund through redeployments from budget lines for which under implementation is expected by the end of 2013, as identified
by the Commission in its proposal for 2013 global transfer (DEC 26/2013).
On the other hand, they endorsed the agreement reached on 12 November 2013 in the framework of the Conciliation Committee (
2013/2145(BUD) with a view to financing this mobilisation up to a level of EUR 250.5 million in payment appropriations in 2013 through
redeployments, and EUR 150 million in 2014 through fresh appropriations.
Members stressed, however, that they maintained their position of principle that the financing of special instruments, like the EU Solidarity
Fund, should be entered in the budget over and above the MFF ceilings. They do not support Council's unilateral statement on payment
appropriations annexed to the joint conclusions on Budget 2014.
Therefore, Members called on the European Parliament to make a number of budgetary amendments to the Councils position on DAB 9/2013
as follows:
- Increasing payment appropriations of the following budget lines:
SESAR Joint Undertaking and IMI;
projects in the field of nanotechnology;
climate change;
nuclear activities of the Joint Research Centre;
People initiative.
- Reducing payment appropriations of the following budget lines:
European Globalisation Fund;
European Solidarity Fund;
macro-financial assistance.
A series of specific expenses in the field of research were also reduced both in payment and commitment appropriations.
Overall, the draft amending budget 9/2013 proves to be neutral from a budgetary point of view regarding payment appropriations but has led to
a reduction as regards commitment appropriations of approximately EUR 26 884 000.

2013/2257(BUD) - 20/11/2013 Final act

PURPOSE: definitive adoption of amending budget 9/2013.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: 2014/66/EU, Euratom.

appropriations. The mobilisation is in favour of Romania, Germany, Austria and the Czech Republic in relation to natural disasters in 2012 and
2013.
