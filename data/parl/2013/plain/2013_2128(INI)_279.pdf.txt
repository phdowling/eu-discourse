2013/2128(INI) - 10/01/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Regional Development adopted the own-initiative report by Elisabeth SCHROEDTER (Greens/EFA, DE) on the local and
regional consequences of the development of smart grids.
The Committee on the Industry, Research and Energy, exercising its prerogatives as an associated committee under Parliaments Rule 50 of
the Rules of Procedure, also gave an opinion on the report.
New opportunities for the regional economy: Members welcomed a paradigm shift for the regions in the way energy is produced and
consumed, moving from an inflexible traditional model, which functions on a base load logic, to variable, decentralised and local production,
integrating a high share of small-scale renewable energy with flexible and responsive demand and distributed storage. They recognised that in
order to preserve sustainable development and to meet the requirements of future demands, new models of energy production and
consumption based on decentralised and local production should be promoted. They stressed the fact that a smart grid is essential for such a
paradigm shift and that smart grid implementation should be embedded in a cross-sectoral and comprehensive approach to regional
development in order to maximise benefits and market opportunities for the regions as well as to achieve sustainability, growth and innovation.
The report underlined the numerous benefits of smart grids in terms of lowering greenhouse gas emissions, ensuring the security of supply to
households, giving consumers the ability to adapt their consumption in order to benefit from the lowest prices and at the same time save
energy, improving energy efficiency, saving electrical power, etc.
The deployment and operation of smart grids, in particular, offer opportunities to disadvantaged regions, including outermost, peripheral and
island regions, which can reduce the energy costs that they incur.
Member States and regional and local authorities are called upon to invest as early as possible in local smart grids by thoroughly considering
boosting investments using the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF), including financial instruments to leverage private
investment. The report called for a flexible approach at local and regional level to reduce the barriers to combining measures for energy
production, storage, including across borders, and efficiency.
Stressing that the deployment of smart grids requires a stable, long-term policy framework, Members called on the Commission to propose
ambitious strategies, policies and targets for 2030 for energy efficiency and renewable energies as well as for greenhouse gas emissions, in
order to give future certainty to investors and interconnected industries and to facilitate a smart energy system.
A more flexible approach in EU regulations and directives on the internal market is called for to reduce barriers to region-specific solutions in
terms of energy production, supply and storage.
Smart energy systems: for smart grids to be successfully implemented, a strategy for regions and local communities aimed at smart energy
systems should be developed. The report noted the role that smart meters have in enabling two-way communication, allowing for accurate
billing for consumers and increasing demand-side participation. It highlighted that every citizen should have direct access to consumption and
production data in order to ensure efficient, safe and secure smart grid operations and urged the Commission to take steps to ensure that
electrical appliances are capable of operating automatically in conjunction with smart meters by providing consumers with the most favourable
tariffs.
Role of citizens: the report emphasised that the success of a smart energy system is often due to local ownership by individual citizens, a
cooperative, a local community or a combination of these actors. Such ownerships increase the acceptance of investments in all elements of
smart energy systems. The importance of informing and educating users to become informed prosumers who are aware of the opportunities
offered by these grids, particularly as regards their link to smart meters has been stressed.
The Commission is called upon to remove the barriers and regulatory and legal challenges to local ownership in existing EU legislation , in
particular in the state aid rules. Member States are invited to support local energy feed-in possibilities and the sharing of local energy, not only
bi-directionally between the grid and the end-user but also cross-border and between end-user units.
The report stressed that the implementation of smart energy systems will significantly change the private and public spheres, as electricity
provision will be linked to data collection and communicated in real time. It called, therefore, for transparent procedures at all levels, involving
all actors, including citizens, businesses, industry, local authorities, distribution system operators (DSOs), transmission system operators
(TSOs), local and regional data protection officials or ombudsmen and the providers of smart grid technologies.

Data protection and privacy: the report emphasised the need for high standards for smart meters in terms of data protection and data privacy.
More specifically, the report called on the Commission to:
reduce the barriers to investment in smart energy systems, particularly by expanding the exemption within the state aid
modernisations (SAM) to allow for public support for all elements of regional and local smart energy systems, including cross-sectoral
investments and operations;
urges for smart energy systems to be included as a category in the future Commission regulation declaring certain categories of aid
compatible with the internal market and adapting the regulations on other block exemption categories which interact with the
development of smart energy systems;
agree upon a unified classification system to determine whether an organisation is to be deemed a transmission operator, a
distribution operator or a combined operator;
assess whether it is necessary to bring forward proposals, in line with the third internal energy market package, for the development
and promotion of smart grids (these proposals should be integrated into a streamlined regulatory framework in accordance with the
principles laid down by the Commission);
establish a transnational network for regions with smart energy systems.

2013/2128(INI) - 04/02/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 571 votes to 87, with 22 abstentions, a resolution on the local and regional consequences of the
development of smart grids.
A number of best practice examples, such as the Burgenland region, the Energy Valley in the Netherlands, the regenerative model region of
Harz in Germany, Host?tín in the Czech Republic, the Orkney Micro Renewables project in Scotland, as well as pilot project cities and
communities under the Commissions CONCERTO initiative or the CO-POWER initiative for the efficient use of energy and decentralised
energy production show that local communities and citizens can become prosumers (producer-consumer).
In the light of these examples, Parliament made the following recommendations:
New opportunities for the regional economy: Members welcomed a paradigm shift for the regions in the way energy is produced and
consumed, moving from an inflexible traditional model, which functions on a base load logic, to variable, decentralised and local production,
