Commission response to text adopted in
plenary

2013/2134(INI) - 09/07/2013 Resolution/conclusions adopted by Council
In the framework of the European Semester, the Council issued:
recommendations to 23 Member States on the economic and employment policies set out in their national reform programmes, and
opinions on their fiscal policies, as presented in their stability/convergence programmes;
a specific recommendation on the economic policies of the Member States of the euro area.
Adoption of the texts, generally endorsed by the European Council on 27 and 28 June, concludes the 2012 European Semester monitoring
exercise.
In accordance with the "comply or explain" principle introduced in 2011 in the "six-pack" reform of policy monitoring, the Council issued
explanations in cases where its country-specific recommendations do not comply with those proposed by the Commission (see doc 11336/13).
In setting out the priorities for this year's European Semester, the European Council emphasised the need to accelerate efforts to support
growth as a matter of priority whilst pursuing growth-friendly fiscal consolidation.
Within the period 2013-2014, the Member States of the eurozone are invited to:
take responsibility for the aggregate policy stance in the euro area in order to ensure the good functioning of the euro area to increase
growth and employment, and to take forward the work on deepening Economic and Monetary Union;
ensure that the Eurogroup monitors and coordinates fiscal policies of the euro area Member States and the aggregate fiscal stance for
the euro area as a whole to ensure a growth friendly and differentiated fiscal policy;
building on the recapitalisation and the restructuring of the past years, promote further balance-sheet repair among banks as a means
to reverse fragmentation in the single market and improve the flow of credit to the real economy, particularly SMEs;
coordinate ex ante the major economic reform plans of the Member States whose currency is the euro;
promote further adjustment in the euro area, ensuring a correction of external and internal imbalances;
take the necessary steps for an effective implementation of the Macroeconomic Imbalances Procedure.
In line with the Annual Growth Survey 2013, it is crucial for the euro area Member States to take collective and significant measures in order to
tackle the social consequences of the crisis and the rising unemployment levels.
The Council recommends:

that bold action should be taken along the lines of the Compact for Growth and jobs and the EU Youth Guarantee to tackle youth
unemployment;
further reforms to facilitate access to employment, prevent early withdrawals from the labour market, reduce the cost of labour, combat
labour market segmentation and support innovation are recommended.

2013/2134(INI) - 08/10/2013 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs adopted an own-initiative report Elisa FERREIRA (S&D, PT) on the European Semester for
economic policy coordination: implementation of 2013 priorities.
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, exercising its powers as an associated committee under Rule 50 of the Rules of Procedure,
was also consulted and gave its opinion on the report.
Whilst welcoming the country-specific recommendations made by the Commission, Members feel that the former need to be more precisely
defined and improved for some Member States.
They consider that urgent action is required in many areas, inter alia in:
·

restoring lending to the real economy and SMEs, which involves developing alternative resources of financing,

·

making the business environment more competitive,

·

fighting tax fraud, tax evasion and aggressive tax planning,

·

restoring the sustainability of public finances and

·

seeking effective European solutions to unemployment and thus establishing a fully integrated labour market and also significantly
enhancing the social dimension of EMU.

The report welcomes the Commissions statement that deficit countries need to boost their competitiveness and that surplus countries need to
boost, where possible, their demand in a proportionate and sustainable way in order to contribute to the stability and growth of the eurozone.
The committee believes that the EU economy as a whole needs to boost its competitiveness in the global economy. It stresses that the EU
cannot compete on costs alone, but needs to invest more in research and development, education and skills, and resource efficiency.
The Commission is asked to:
·

submit as a matter of urgency legislative proposals with the aim of creating a genuine convergence process within the EU Semester,
based on Europe 2020 objectives, such as a Competitiveness and Convergence Instrument (CCI), as well as provisions on ex-ante
economic policy coordination;

·

develop a genuine European industrial policy, based on enhanced competitiveness and innovation,

·

submit legislative proposals to complete the EMU, which should include a social pillar and set up a social pact for Europe, as
recommended by Parliament in its resolution of 20 November 2012.

Members regret delays in implementing the EUR 120 billion Compact for Growth and Jobs agreed in June 2012, the Project Bond initiative
launched in November 2012 and the EUR 180 billion additional investment by the EIB. They call on the Council and the Commission to
investigate and quickly remove the obstacles preventing full delivery of these initiatives.
Employment and social policies: Members consider the Commissions recognition of the need to reduce taxes on employment in favour of
other sources of income to be a positive development, which will speed up the fiscal consolidation process on a fairer basis.
The report makes the following observations:
·

there must be increased targeting of EU funding on all priorities under the Europe 2020 strategy, in particular through growth and
employment policies, including combating youth unemployment and long-term unemployment, and creating lasting jobs which are
not precarious, and are adequately remunerated;

·

the necessary flexibility that exists on the labour market must not adversely affect the high levels of social protection;

·

labour market reforms must aim at promoting quality in work, improving social risk management, achieving progress in the inclusion
of vulnerable groups in the labour market, reducing in-work poverty, reconciling work and family life, promoting gender equality,
promoting health and safety at work, strengthening the rights of workers with atypical contracts and improving social protection for
self-employed workers.

Members want to see a European Pact for Youth Employment and encourage the Commission to continue the work of the Youth Employment
Action Teams to help the Member States with the highest levels of youth unemployment to re-programme EU structural funding under the
2007-2013 MFF in order to target it at young people.
Internal market: the Commission is asked to make single market governance a priority in its next Annual Growth Survey and in the European
Semester 2014, and, in the next country-specific recommendations, to take full account of the key growth areas identified as the services
sector, the energy sector, the transport sector and the digital single market.
Members call for full and appropriate implementation of the EU Services Directive whilst safeguarding public service obligations.
The Commission is asked, in the meantime, to step up its efforts to enforce single market legislation and to monitor this enforcement.
Regional policies: deeply concerned by the sharp downturn in public and private investment in the productive economy and especially at local
and regional level, Members are convinced that that the Structural and Investment Funds are essential in order to boost public investment.
Member States are urged to do their utmost to decide in a timely manner on their national programming for the Structural Funds and the
Cohesion Fund, in order to avoid delays in using these funds, whose aim is to support growth and job creation.

Womens rights and gender equality: the report stresses that new technology affords both employers and employees new opportunities for
organising work in such a way as to strike a better work-life balance and thus make the labour market more inclusive for women.
The Commission and Member States are asked to bear in mind the objective of gender equality in the national work programmes.
Democratic legitimacy and the European semester: Members stress the need for dedicated respect for parliamentary prerogatives at
European and national level and for those of the Commission as laid down in the Treaties and EU law against the trend of an increasingly
intergovernmental culture of economic-policy making at EU and euro-area level.

2013/2134(INI) - 23/10/2013 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 476 votes to 96, with 25 abstentions, a resolution on the European Semester for economic policy
coordination: implementation of 2013 priorities.
Whilst welcoming the country-specific recommendations made by the Commission, Members felt that the former need to be more precisely
defined and improved for some Member States.
They considered that urgent action is required in many areas, inter alia in:
restoring lending to the real economy and SMEs, which involves developing alternative resources of financing,
making the business environment more competitive,
fighting tax fraud, tax evasion and aggressive tax planning,
restoring the sustainability of public finances and
seeking effective European solutions to unemployment and thus establishing a fully integrated labour market and also significantly
enhancing the social dimension of EMU.
Parliament welcomed the achievements made in several Member States which allowed their deficit procedures to be closed. It also welcomes
the Commissions statement that deficit countries need to boost their competitiveness and that surplus countries need to boost, where possible,
their demand in a proportionate and sustainable way in order to contribute to the stability and growth of the eurozone.
Members welcomed the Commissions statement that already in this years budgetary execution assessment and in the analysis of the national
budgets for 2014, the Commission will try to accommodate, under certain conditions, non-recurrent, public investment programmes with a
proven impact on the sustainability of public finances, while fully respecting the EU fiscal surveillance framework.
Members believed that the EU economy as a whole needs to boost its competitiveness in the global economy. They stressed that the EU
cannot compete on costs alone, but needs to invest more in research and development, education and skills, and resource efficiency.
The Commission is asked to:
submit as a matter of urgency legislative proposals with the aim of creating a genuine convergence process within the EU Semester,
based on Europe 2020 objectives, such as a Competitiveness and Convergence Instrument (CCI), as well as provisions on ex-ante
economic policy coordination;
develop a genuine European industrial policy, based on enhanced competitiveness and innovation that focuses on restoring European
industrial competitiveness and scaling back policies which cause companies to relocate outside the EU;
submit legislative proposals to complete the EMU, which should include a social pillar and set up a social pact for Europe, as
recommended by Parliament in its resolution of 20 November 2012.
Parliament called for closer monitoring of the application of the new prudential rules and the banking sector practices in financing the real
economy, in particular economically viable SMEs. It called for direct banking recapitalisation by the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) to be
available as soon as the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) is in place.
Employment and social policies: Parliament called for increased targeting of EU funding on all priorities under the Europe 2020 strategy, in
particular through growth and employment policies, including combating youth unemployment and long-term unemployment, and creating
lasting jobs which are not precarious, entail the compulsory payment of social security contributions and are adequately remunerated. In this
regard, it should be ensured that the necessary flexibility that is needed on the labour market is balanced with adequate levels of social
protection.
Members want to see a European Pact for Youth Employment and encouraged the Commission to continue the work of the Youth
Employment Action Teams to help the Member States with the highest levels of youth unemployment to re-programme EU structural funding
under the 2007-2013 MFF in order to target it at young people . They welcomed the adoption of the Youth Guarantee by the Council and the
earmarking of EUR 6 billion for the Youth Employment Initiative under the next MFF.
Parliament called for:
specific action to increase the labour participation of women, older workers and workers with disabilities by ensuring that there are
efficient incentives to return to, and stay in, work;
support for the long-term unemployed through positive activation incentives such as personalised guidance and welfare-to-work
programmes;
labour market reforms with adequate levels of social protection which aim to reduce in-work poverty and strengthen the rights of
workers with atypical contracts and improving social protection for self-employed workers.
The resolution recalled the skills mismatches and bottlenecks in many regions and sectors and the inability of certain education and training
systems to cope with market demands and workers needs in this context.
Internal market: the Commission is asked to make single market governance a priority in its next Annual Growth Survey and in the European
Semester 2014, and, in the next country-specific recommendations, to take full account of the key growth areas identified as the services
sector, the energy sector, the transport sector and the digital single market.
Members call for full and appropriate implementation of the EU Services Directive whilst safeguarding public service obligations.

The Commission is asked, in the meantime, to step up its efforts to enforce single market legislation and to monitor this enforcement.
Regional policies: deeply concerned by the sharp downturn in public and private investment in the productive economy and especially at local
and regional level, Members are convinced that that the Structural and Investment Funds are essential in order to boost public investment.
Member States are urged to do their utmost to decide in a timely manner on their national programming for the Structural Funds and the
Cohesion Fund, in order to avoid delays in using these funds, whose aim is to support growth and job creation.
Womens rights and gender equality: Parliament welcomed the country-specific recommendations (CSRs) regarding measures to improve
childcare facilities, to remove disincentives for second earners and to accommodate the need to combine work and private life.
It stresses the importance of gender budgeting with a view to examining all government programmes and policies, their effects on resource
allocation, and their contribution to equality between women and men.
Democratic legitimacy and the European semester: Members stress the need for dedicated respect for parliamentary prerogatives at
European and national level and for those of the Commission as laid down in the Treaties and EU law against the trend of an increasingly
intergovernmental culture of economic-policy making at EU and euro-area level. They urge the Commission to ensure the proper formal
involvement of the European Parliament in all the steps of the European Semester process in order to increase the legitimacy of decisions
which affect all citizens; calls on the Commission to find ways to increase the visibility of the process.
