2013/2074(INI) - 19/08/2013 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Foreign Affairs adopted the report by Ana GOMES (S&D, PT) on corruption in the public and private sectors: the impact on
human rights in third countries.
Members recalled that, according to the World Bank, corruption represents 5% of global GDP (USD 2.6 trillion), with over USD 1 trillion paid in
bribes each year and that it adds up to 10% of the total cost of doing business on a global basis and 25 % of the cost of procurement contracts
in developing countries.
They also noted that each year USD 20-40 billion, corresponding to 20-40% of official development assistance, is stolen from public budgets in
developing countries.
With this in mind, Members believed that the EU can only become a credible and influential leader in the fight against corruption if it addresses
the problems of organised crime, corruption and money laundering within its own borders in an adequate manner.
Although welcoming, in this regard, various initiatives taken at European level including the renegotiation of the Savings Taxation Directive,
meant effectively to end banking secrecy, Members considered that these actions are not sufficiently ambitious and that the EU should follow
the example of the United States in enacting the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012 and adopt similar legislation at EU
level by establishing a common EU list of officials involved in the death of Sergei Magnitsky.
They also called on the Commission to draw up an action plan, with a view to creating a mechanism for listing and imposing similar targeted
sanctions against officials of third countries (including police officers, prosecutors and judges) involved in grave human rights violations and
judicial manipulations against whistleblowers, journalists reporting on corruption and human rights activists in third countries.
Accountability and transparency of external aid and public budgets: Members supported the EUs commitment to embrace and mainstream
throughout its development policies the concept of democratic ownership, that is, the effective and full participation of people in the design,
implementation and monitoring of development strategies and policies of donors and partner governments. Such a policy fosters involvement
of programme beneficiaries and therefore contributes to greater monitoring and accountability in the fight against corruption. To ensure that the
blending facilities expand the effectiveness of development finance, the governance of those instruments needs to be reviewed. They
therefore called on the Commission to impose the highest levels of integrity in the procurement processes for implementation of EU-funded
projects. This approach would benefit all concerned, including associations of land-owners as well as disadvantaged groups.
Members also urged the EU to further transparency by supporting the creation of a global system to track aid pledges, in order to be able to
hold donor countries to their promises of aid and to hold them accountable for the projects, institutions or groups that they support. They
suggested that the Commission publicise the reporting mechanisms within OLAF regarding misuse of EU funds among participants in public
tenders and beneficiaries of EU aid.
Several other measures were proposed such as:
greater transparency on the beneficiaries of funding;
enhanced controls;
initiatives from the international financial institutions (IMF, World Bank) to evaluate the risk of corruption and bolstering transparency
(for example, the Publish What You Pay initiative).
Corruption and development policies: emphasising that the poorest people in developing countries, being heavily reliant on public services, are
hurt disproportionately by petty corruption, Members called for greater consistency in development policies stressing that EU assistance in the
areas of fiscal governance and action on tax fraud needs to be increased under its development funding instruments.

Improving Member States jurisdiction: Members requested the Member States to amend their criminal laws, where necessary, to establish
jurisdiction over individuals of any nationality found on their territory who have committed acts of bribery or embezzlement of public funds ,
regardless of where the crime occurred.
They also urged the Member States, as recommended by the UNCAC, to adopt legislative and other measures to establish intentionally
committed illicit enrichment that is, a significant increase in the assets of a public official that he or she cannot reasonably explain in relation to
his or her lawful income as a criminal offence
Capacity building of anti-corruption institutions: Members called on the EU and the Member States to initiate the development of international
standards on the independence and effectiveness of anti-corruption authorities, drafted intergovernmentally with the aim of final adoption by
the UN General Assembly. They urged the EU and its Member States to foster and show support for the creation of an International
Commission Against Corruption established by an international treaty or by a Protocol to the UNCAC, which would give rise to an international
body of criminal investigators endowed with equivalent powers of national law enforcement and prosecution authorities to investigate and
prosecute crimes of corruption in domestic territories of the signatory States, and being able also to indict individuals in national criminal
courts. They also invited the Member States to support the establishment of a UN Special Rapporteur on financial crime, corruption and
human rights.
Corporate responsibility: Members requested all EU enterprises to fulfil their corporate responsibility to respect human rights in line with the
UN Guiding Principles. They called for the development of more effective transparency and accountability standards for EU technology
companies in connection with the export of technologies that can be used to violate human rights.
They also urged the Commission to propose legislation requiring EU companies to ensure that their purchases do not support perpetrators of
corruption, conflicts and grave human rights violations. They reiterated the need for the EU and the Member States to take appropriate
measures to monitor and eventually sanction companies based on their territory which are involved in corruption in third countries. A public list
of companies which have been convicted of corrupt practices or whose company officials are being indicted for corrupt practices in Member
States or third countries should be published. They also welcomed the agreements reached between the European Parliament and the
Council requiring companies in the extractive sector and loggers of primary forests to disclose payments to governments on a country and
project basis and called for this practice to be extended.
Peace and stability operations: Members stressed that corruption often fuels crime and contributes to conflict and fragility of countries. They
called, therefore, on the UN to take steps to ensure that those who are victimised by peacekeepers have the right to remedy, and to improve
reporting mechanisms and the whistleblower protection policy.
Members also called on the Union and its Member States to support:
the creation of the oversight mechanism of the International Anti-Corruption Code of Conduct;
the creation of an international framework regulating the activities of military and private security companies, that would include
dissuasive sanctions.
International cooperation and assistance: Members recommended that Member States enhance the implementation of Chapters IV
(International Cooperation) and V (Asset Recovery) of UNCAC, especially to grant more efficiency to mutual legal assistance requested by
third countries.
They encouraged the Commission to propose in the next revision of the Cotonou Agreement the respect of good governance as an essential
element of the Agreement and to widen the scope of the definition of corruption, allowing the sanctioning of breaches of the good governance
clause in all serious circumstances, and not only when related to economic and sectoral policies and programmes on which the European
Union is a significant partner in terms of the financial support
Welcoming the initiatives taken in the context of the Arab Spring (recovery of dictators assets), Members called on the Union and its Member
States to provide legal and technical assistance to developing countries that wish to recover stolen assets (or assets accumulated illegally by
dictatorships) that are held in the territory of the European Union.
Lastly, they encouraged the Union to ensure greater vigilance in relation to European arms manufacturers exports and to combat opaqueness
in the arms trade sector, especially in relation to the use of intermediaries and economic/industrial offsets.

2013/2074(INI) - 08/10/2013 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a resolution on corruption in the public and private sectors: the impact on human rights in third countries.
Parliament recalled, according to the World Bank, corruption represents 5% of global GDP (USD 2.6 trillion), with over USD 1 trillion paid in
bribes each year and that it adds up to 10% of the total cost of doing business on a global basis and 25 % of the cost of procurement contracts
in developing countries.
It also noted that each year USD 20-40 billion, corresponding to 20-40% of official development assistance, is stolen from public budgets in
developing countries.
Parliament deplores that from 2000 to 2009, developing countries lost USD 8.44 trillion to illicit financial flows, ten times more than what they
received in foreign aid. It stressed that the money stolen through corruption each year is enough to keep the world's hungry fed 80 times over.
With this in mind, Parliament believed that the EU can only become a credible and influential leader in the fight against corruption if it
addresses the problems of organised crime, corruption and money laundering within its own borders in an adequate manner .
Although welcoming, in this regard, various initiatives taken at European level including the renegotiation of the Savings Taxation Directive,
meant effectively to end banking secrecy, Parliament considered that these actions are not sufficiently ambitious and that the EU should follow
the example of the United States in enacting the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012 and adopt similar legislation at EU
level by establishing a common EU list of officials involved in the death of Sergei Magnitsky. This Council Decision should impose targeted
sanctions on those officials, such as an EU-wide visa ban and a freezing order on any financial assets that they or their immediate family may
hold inside the European Union.

Members also called on the Commission to draw up an action plan, with a view to creating a mechanism for listing and imposing similar
targeted sanctions against officials of third countries (including police officers, prosecutors and judges) involved in grave human rights
violations and judicial manipulations against whistleblowers, journalists reporting on corruption and human rights activists in third countries.
Accountability and transparency of external aid and public budgets: Parliament supported the EUs commitment to embrace and mainstream

tenders and beneficiaries of EU aid.
Several other measures were proposed such as:
greater transparency on the beneficiaries of funding;
enhanced controls;
an extension of the definition of human rights defenders in the EU Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders to include anti-corruption
activists, investigative journalists and, notably, whistleblowers;
initiatives from the international financial institutions (IMF, World Bank) to evaluate the risk of corruption and bolstering transparency
(for example, the Publish What You Pay initiative).
Corruption and development policies: emphasising that the poorest people in developing countries, being heavily reliant on public services, are
hurt disproportionately by petty corruption, Parliament called for greater consistency in development policies stressing that EU assistance in
the areas of fiscal governance and action on tax fraud needs to be increased under its development funding instruments.
Parliament believes that fighting corruption, including tax havens, tax evasion and illicit capital flights, is part of a broader effort to promote
good governance, which is defined as one of the key priorities to enhance the effectiveness of EU development policy.
Improving Member States jurisdiction: Parliament requested the Member States to amend their criminal laws, where necessary, to establish
jurisdiction over individuals of any nationality found on their territory who have committed acts of bribery or embezzlement of public funds ,
regardless of where the crime occurred.
