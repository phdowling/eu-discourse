Summary

2013/2278(IMM) - 12/02/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Legal Affairs unanimously adopted the report by Dimitar STOYANOV (NI, BG) in which it recommended the European
Parliament to waive the immunity of Tadeusz CYMA?SKI (EFD, PL).
To recall, the Republic of Poland has requested the waiver of the parliamentary immunity of Tadeusz Cyma?ski in connection with a request
for authorisation to bring criminal proceedings against a Member of the European Parliament made by the General Inspectorate of Road
Traffic with regard to the offence set out in Article 96(3) of the Polish Code of Minor Offences.

Given that the alleged offence (speeding) does not have a direct or obvious connection with Tadeusz Cyma?skis performance of his duties as
a Member of the European Parliament, nor does it constitute an opinion expressed or a vote cast in the performance of his duties as a
Member of the European Parliament for the purposes of Article 8 of Protocol No 7 on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Union and
that the Members found no evidence of fumus persecutionis, that is to say, a sufficiently serious and precise suspicion that the case has been
brought with the intention of causing political damage to the Member concerned, the committee called on the European Parliament to waive
the immunity of Tadeusz Cyma?ski.
