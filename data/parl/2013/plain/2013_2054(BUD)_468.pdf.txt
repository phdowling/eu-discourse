2013/2054(BUD) - 18/03/2013 Commission draft budget
PURPOSE: to present draft amending budget No 1 to the General Budget 2013 providing for expenditure relating to the accession of Croatia
to the European Union from 1 July 2013.
CONTENT: the draft amending budget No 1 for the year 2013
concerns the incorporation into the 2013 Budget of both the commitment and payment appropriations necessary to cover expenditure related
to the accession of Croatia to the European Union on 1 July 2013, in full respect of the Accession Treaty.
In parallel with this exercise, the Commission is presenting a proposal for the revision of the multiannual financial framework 2007-2013, in
order to accommodate these changes, as foreseen under point 29 of the Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline and sound
financial management.
The increases proposed in DAB No 1 amount to:
EUR 655.1 million in commitment appropriations ,and
EUR 374 million in payment appropriations.
These reflect the financial package agreed at the Accession Conference of 30 June 2011, but exclude heading 5, in line with the Commission's
restricted approach on administrative expenditure, and since the needs related to accession are already included in the 2013 budget.
The Treaty of Accession defines pre-allocated amounts for:
the Transition Facility,
the Schengen Facility,
the Cash-Flow Facility (a temporary instrument to help Croatia between the date of accession and the end of 2014 to improve

cash-flow in the national budget),
the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Fund and the European Fisheries Fund.
The allocation of both the commitment and payment appropriations on the budget lines has been made according to the repartition proposed
by the Treaty of Accession, while taking also into account the possibility to properly implement the additional funding before the end of the
year.
Indicative sectorial allocations: the document provides details of the amounts envisaged for the funding of Croatias participation in the main
European programmes:
the 7th Framework Programme for Research (FP7) in which Croatia has already participated as a candidate country: the additional
commitment appropriations (EUR 37.4 million) will be allocated proportionally to the activities and actions foreseen in the annual 2013
FP7 Work Programmes;
education and lifelong learning: EUR 9.8 million in commitments and EUR 6.4 million in payments.
Croatia and pre-accession assistance: the total commitments outstanding for Croatia under the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA)
amounted to EUR 220 million under the IPA-components 'Transition Assistance and Institution Building' and 'Rural development'. As the
payment claims to be received in 2013 will exceed the availabilities in the 2013 budget, it is proposed to reinforce these two IPA-components
by EUR 86.8 million in payment appropriations. This is especially important as the Treaty of Accession specifies that the amounts of the rural
development for Croatia should stay in Heading 4 even after the accession.

2013/2054(BUD) - 26/06/2013 Council position on draft budget
On 18 March 2013, the Commission submitted to the Council draft amending budget (DAB) No 1/2013 regarding additional commitment (c/a)
and payment appropriations (p/a) necessary to cover expenditure related to the accession of Croatia to the EU on 1 July 2013.
In parallel, it submitted a proposal for a revision of the multiannual financial framework (MFF) 2007-2013 to take account of the expenditure
requirements resulting from the accession of Croatia to the EU.
DAB No 1/2013 proposes to increase c/a by EUR 655.1 million and p/a by EUR 374 million across different headings of the MFF.
The breakdown proposed by the Commission is as follows:
Sub-heading 1a: +EUR 47.2 million in c/a and +EUR 17.6 million in p/a;
Sub-heading 1b: +EUR 449.4 million in c/a and +EUR 149.8 million in p/a;
Heading 2: +EUR 10.2 million in c/a and +EUR 2.6 million in p/a;
Sub-heading 3a: +EUR 42.1 million in c/a and +EUR 41.1 million in p/a;
Sub-heading 3b: +EUR 31.2 million in c/a and +EUR 1.1 million in p/a;
Heading 4: +EUR 86.8 million in p/a;
Heading 6 (Compensation): +EUR 75 million in c/a and p/a.
Heading 5 is excluded from the proposal since the needs related to the accession of Croatia were already included in the 2013 budget.
On 26 June 2013, the Council adopted its position on draft amending budget No 1/2013 as set out in the technical annex to this explanatory
memorandum of the DAB (see 11607/13 ADD 1).

2013/2054(BUD) - 01/07/2013 Budgetary report tabled for plenary, 1st reading
The Committee on Budgets adopted the report by Giovanni LA VIA (EPP, IT) on the Council position on Draft amending budget No 1/2013 of
the European Union for the financial year 2013, Section III Commission.
Members recall that the draft amending budget No 1/2013 aims to incorporate into the 2013 Budget the commitment and payment
appropriations needed to cover expenditure related to the accession of Croatia to the Union as from 1 July 2013. In parallel, the Commission
submitted a proposal for the adjustment of the multiannual financial framework to accommodate these changes.
The proposed increase of EUR 655.1 million in commitments and EUR 374 million in payments, excluding heading 5, since the administrative
expenditure linked to the accession of Croatia is already included in Budget 2013.
Whilst calling on the Council to adopt amending budget No1/2013, Members regret that this Amending budget has been kept separate from
the ongoing political interinstitutional debate on how to settle the issue of outstanding payments from 2012 and from the negotiations on DAB
No 2/2013.
They emphasise the purely technical nature of this Amending budget which is simply the consequence of the unanimous agreement on the
Treaty concerning the accession of the Republic of Croatia to the European Union as the 28th Member State of the Union.
Delayed agreement: Members reiterate their position that the eight-week period provided for by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European
Union to inform the national parliaments of any draft legislative act does not apply to budgetary issues. They regret therefore that despite the
very tight timeframe for the entry into force of this Amending budget, the Council has nevertheless let this period elapse before adopting its
position, thus squeezing the time for adoption by Parliament as foreseen by the Treaty.
Members regret furthermore the difficulty with which, even after the eight weeks deadline had elapsed, the Council reached an agreement on
this revision, which has led to a delay in the availability of the funding for Croatia due as from 1 July 2013.
Members welcome that the Council could eventually agree on a revision without any offsetting of the 2013 ceilings for payments by the
required EUR 374 million. They consider that, given the limited amount concerned and the current shortage of payment appropriations in the
2013 budget, this is the proper way to fulfil the obligation that the Member States took out when signing the Accession Treaty and to respect

the provisions of point 29 of the IIA of 17 May 2006.
Members deplore however that as regards the revision in commitments the Council decided to neglect the political importance of adopting the
Commission's proposal as such, opting instead for an offset of the appropriations required. They denounce that this contradicts the spirit of the
unanimous decision taken when signing the Treaty of Accession as well as of the IIA of 17 May 2006. Such a decision sends a wrong political
signal not only to Croatia but to the other candidate countries as well.
They stress that this decision of the Council is accepted only because it concerns the last 6 months of the current MFF (2007-2013) and that
this should not constitute a precedent for future enlargements that might occur under the next MFF (2014-2020).
Nevertheless, considering the political importance and the legal urgency of ensuring the necessary funding to Croatia, Members call on the
European Parliament to approve, without amendment, Council's position on Draft amending budget No 1/2013.

2013/2054(BUD) - 04/07/2013 Budgetary text adopted by Parliament
The European Parliament adopted by 559 votes to 25, with 16 abstentions, a resolution on the Council position on Draft amending budget No
1/2013 of the European Union for the financial year 2013, Section III Commission.

European Parliament to approve, without amendment, Council's position on Draft amending budget No 1/2013.
