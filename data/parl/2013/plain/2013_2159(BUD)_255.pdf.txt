PURPOSE: to mobilise the Flexibility Instrument to complement the financing of the European Social Fund in 2013.
PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
CONTENT: the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 allows for the mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument to allow the financing of
clearly identified expenditure which could not be financed within the limits of the ceilings available for one or more headings of the multiannual
financial framework.
In accordance with point 27 of the Interinstitutional Agreement, and after having examined all possibilities for re-allocating appropriations under
heading 1b, the Commission proposes to mobilise the flexibility instrument to complement the financing in the general budget of the European
Union for the financial year 2013, beyond the ceiling of heading 1b, of EUR 134 049 037 towards the financing of the European Social Fund to
increase the allocations to France, Italy and Spain for the year 2013 by a total amount of EUR 150 000 000 .
