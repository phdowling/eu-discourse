2013/2196(DEC) - 26/07/2013 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: presentation by the Commission of the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2012, as part of
the 2012 discharge procedure.
Analysis of the accounts of the EU Institutions: Section I - European Parliament.
Legal reminder: the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the year 2012 have been prepared on the basis of the
information presented by the institutions and bodies under Article 129(2) of the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the
European Union. They were prepared in accordance with Title VII of the Financial Regulation and with the accounting principles, rules and
methods set out in the notes to the financial statements.
The objective of the financial statements is to provide information about the financial position, performance and cashflow of a body that is
useful to a wide range of users. The objective is to provide information that is useful for decision making, and to demonstrate the accountability
of the entity for the resources entrusted to it.
1) Purpose: the document helps to bring insight into the EU budget mechanism and the way in which the budget has been managed and spent
in 2012. It recalls that the European Union's operational expenditure covers the various headings of the financial framework and takes different
forms, depending on how the money is paid out and managed. In accordance with the Financial Regulation, the Commission implements the
general budget using the following methods: direct or indirect centralised management (by means of bodies or agencies of public law or other);
decentralised management where the Commission delegates certain tasks for the implementation of the budget to third countries; and, thirdly,
shared management where budget implementation tasks are delegated to Member States, in areas such as agricultural expenditure and
structural actions.
The document also presents the different financial actors involved in the budget process (accounting officers, internal officers and authorising
officers) and recalls their respective roles in the context of the tasks of sound financial management.
Amongst the other legal elements relating to the implementation of the EU budget presented in this document, the paper focuses on the
following issues:
accounting principles applicable to the management of EU spending (business continuity, consistency of accounting methods,
comparability of information ...);
consolidation methods of figures for all major controlled entities (the consolidated financial statements of the EU comprise all
significant controlled entities institutions, organisations and agencies);
the recognition of financial assets in the EU (tangible and intangible assets, financial assets and other miscellaneous investments);
the way in which EU public expenditure is committed and spent, including pre-financing (cash advances intended for the benefit of an
EU organ);
the means of recovery following irregularities detected;
the modus operandi of the accounting system;
the audit process followed by the European Parliament's granting of the discharge.
To recap, the final control is the discharge of the budget for a given financial year. The discharge represents the political aspect of the external
control of budget implementation and is the decision by which the European Parliament, acting on a Council recommendation, "releases" the
Commission from its responsibility for management of a given budget by marking the end of that budget's existence.
The document also details specific expenditure of the institutions, in particular: i) pensions of former Members and officials of institutions; ii)
joint sickness insurance scheme and iii) buildings. For the Parliament, the outstanding contractual obligation relating to building contracts
totalled EUR 434 million in 2011.
Lastly, the document presents a series of tables and detailed technical indicators on (i) the balance sheet; (ii) the economic outturn account;
(iii) cashflow tables; (iv) technical annexes concerning the financial statements.
2) Implementation of appropriations under Section I of the budget for the financial year 2012: the document comprises a series of detailed
tables, the most important concerning the implementation of the budget. Concerning the European Parliament's expenditure, the table on the
financial and budgetary implementation of this institution is presented as follows (information drawn from the Report on budgetary and financial
management - Section European Parliament).
- Budget: Parliaments final appropriations totalled EUR 1 717 868 121, i.e. 19,62 % of heading V of the Multiannual Financial Framework;
Commitments totalled EUR 1 693 038 015, or 98.6 % of final appropriations;
Payments totalled EUR 1 387 580 140, or 82 % of commitments entered into.
3) Budgetary implementation - conclusions: in more general and political terms, the financial year 2012 was chiefly marked by action to bring
about new structural improvements in order to give Parliament all the resources it needs to play its role in the legislative process to the full
and enable it to capitalise to the full on the enhanced powers conferred on it by the Treaty of Lisbon.

Parliament also:
fully accommodated the 18 additional Members provided for by the Treaty of Lisbon, continued preparations for the accession of
Croatia;
made major changes in the area of information and communication policy with a view to the 2014 elections;
continued to implement multiannual programmes to rationalise and modernise key sectors of its Administration.
As regards Europarl TV, the report stated that it should be adjusted to the ready-to-broadcast-programmes to better match the needs of the
media partners and be progressively integrated into Parliaments website and social media platforms.
It should also be noted that progress has been made in the establishment of the House of European history, the completion of the building
work on the Trèves I Building and the lack of success as regards the tender procedure for the Konrad Adenauer project (LU) and the
continuation of the paperless programme".

2013/2196(DEC) - 24/03/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by C?t?lin Sorin IVAN (S&D, RO) in which it called on the European Parliament to
grant discharge to its President in respect of the implementation of the European Parliament budget for the financial year 2012.
Added value of Parliament's discharge procedure: Members highlighted the added value of the parliamentary procedure leading up to the
annual Parliament discharge. They pointed out that this resolution remains principally focussed on the budget implementation and discharge
for the financial year 2012 and that its main goal is to ensure that taxpayers' public money is used in the best possible w ay while highlighting
where improvements can be made.
Parliament's 2012 budgetary and financial management: Members noted that the Union general budget for 2012 totalled EUR 148.2 billion
million in commitment appropriations, of which Parliament's budget accounted for EUR 1.718 billion (20% of the amount set aside for the 2012
administrative expenditure of the Union institutions as a whole). They noted that authorised appropriations in Parliament's final budget for 2012
represented a 1.9% increase over the 2011 budget and that 99% of the final current appropriations were committed, with a cancellation rate of
1%.
Parliament's report on budgetary and financial management: Members noted that Parliament decided to conduct an end-of-year "mopping-up"
transfer from various budget lines amounting to EUR 45 000 000 in unspent funds intended for the second instalment of the acquisition of the
Trebel building in Brussels (EUR 35 000 000) and the construction of the new KAD building in Luxembourg. They stated that as a result of this,
an estimated EUR 10.4 million in financing charges will be saved over the construction and loan amortisation periods. They deplored,
nevertheless, the fact that Parliament has repeatedly requested that in the interest of budgetary clarity, buildings expenditure be entered in the
budget rather than being financed through a "mopping-up "transferas requested in several previous discharge resolutions.
Court of Auditors' opinions on the reliability of the EP?s 2012 accounts: overall, Members welcomed the fact that the Court of Auditors found
that the testing of transactions indicates that the most likely error present in the population is nil and that the supervisory and control systems
of the administrative expenditure were assessed as effective. They also welcomed the positive opinion as regards the DG?s audits and
insisted on transparency as regards the entire process leading to the discharge procedure to ensure that citizens of the Union are provided
with a true and accurate view of the way that Parliament takes its decisions and uses the resources placed at its disposal.
Code of conduct and conflicts of interest: Members recalled that the Code of Conduct for Parliament's Members with respect to financial
interests and conflicts of interest requires
Members to fully disclose any remunerated activities outside Parliament, the remuneration they receive and any other function they perform
which may give rise to conflicts of interest and that the code expressly prohibits Members from accepting any sum of money or other gift in
exchange for influencing Parliament decisions. They noted that it lays down clear rules on accepting gifts and on former Members engaging in
lobbying. The committee asked that the administration scrutinises at least 15% of these declarations on a regular and annual basis.
The President's political activities: Members called for detailed information on how the President, as a politically neutral figure, has kept his
duties in office separate from his preparations to head the Socialists and Democrats' list in the European elections, in particular with regard to
the staff in his cabinet and in Parliament's information offices and to travel expenses. They considered that in connection with many of those
activities, no distinction has been made between the two roles and called for clear segregation of office holders' functions, following the
Commission's approach, so that Union taxpayers do not have to pay for the election campaigns of European list leaders .
Working places of Parliament: Members recalled that significant historical reasons motivated the seat of the Parliament to be established and
that the question of determination of the seat of a Union institution is the exclusive competence of the Member States. They noted that the
expenditure arising from the geographic dispersion of Parliament constitutes an important identified area of potential savings and welcomed
the Secretary- General?s report of August 2013 regarding the financial impact of the geographic dispersion of the European Parliament. The
report expressed a theoretical net saving when consolidating the three places of work into one, in Brussels, at estimated EUR 88.9 million per
year which represents roughly 5% of Parliament's budget in 2014, 1.03% of the total administrative budget of the Union, and 0.06% of the
overall budget of the Union (the estimated net effect per Union citizen per year of EUR 0.18 if the three places of work of the Parliament were
to be consolidated into one). In addition, 10 703 tonnes of CO2 emissions per year would be saved if Strasbourg (10 235) and Luxembourg
(468) were no longer used as places of work. In this context, Members are looking forward to the publication of the Court of Auditors study to
provide a comprehensive analysis of the potential savings for the Union budget if Parliament had only one working place, as requested in its
resolution of 20 November 2013 on the location of the seats of the European Union?s Institutions.
Management of Parliament's administration: strengthening operational efficiency: Members called on Parliament's responsible bodies to
continue improving, at all possible levels, efficiency in Parliament's daily work. They considered that during the 2009-2014 legislative term, in a
difficult economic and financial context, often random and temporary, although significant, savings were achieved. They believed that
Parliament?s administration should identify additional efficiency measures that carry systematic and definitive structural savings, firstly by
reducing Parliament's budget and secondly by allowing for the redeployment of resources to Parliament's new areas of intervention, notably to
reinforce the scrutiny dimension over the Commission?s implementation of the Union?s policies. They also called on Parliament's
administration to consider increasing the use of the available technologies such as teleconferences and teleworking in order to reduce the
administrative and travelling costs.

In parallel, Members made a series of recommendations aimed towards certain Parliament DGs, in particular the following:
DG Presidency by highlighting difficulties in the appointment of the Director-General for this post;
DG Communication pointing out that: (i) the inconsistency of cash payments to visitors groups although Parliament?s administration
encourages payment by bank transfer or a mix of both methods instead; (ii) the amount of running costs of the "House of European
History" (EUR 800 000/year); (iii) EuroparlTV whose funding amounts to EUR 5 million in 2014 while the project is not a core activity of
Parliament and requests that a cost-benefit analysis be carried out before any new EuroparlTV activities are developed.
DG infrastructure noting that repairing the ceiling support frame in Parliament?s Brussels Chamber will involve costs just above EUR 2
million and acknowledging that the regular on-going inspection and preventive maintenance policy for Parliament?s buildings
introduced in 2012 detected the structural defects in the wooden ceiling beams, thus preventing a major disaster, potentially including
the loss of life and huge damage to the building in question.
DG IT stressing that personal and confidential individual mail-boxes of selected Members, parliamentary assistants and officials have
been compromised after the Parliament has been subject to a man-in-the-middle attack where a hacker has captured the
communication between private smartphones and the public Wi-Fi of the Parliament. In this regard, Members ask that all
parliamentary ICT and telecommunications systems be subject to an independent third party security audit with a view to completing a
clear roadmap towards a more robust ICT security policy in 2015.
Lastly, Members made a series of recommendations on the European Parliament?s policy as regards exceptional negotiated procedures and
on the importance of political groups within the European Parliament. In this regard, they stressed that the political groups are key actors for
Parliament and the Union as a whole as their transnational nature represents a unique model in the world and their role is crucial in order to
guarantee a strong democratic accountability of all Union institutions.

2013/2196(DEC) - 03/04/2014 Final act
PURPOSE: to grant discharge to the European Parliament for the 2012 financial year.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision 2014/542/EU, Euratom of the European Parliament on discharge in respect of the implementation of the

CONTENT: under this Decision and according to Article 318 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the European
Parliament grants its President discharge in respect of the implementation of the European Parliament budget for the financial year 2012.
The Decision is in line with the European Parliaments resolution approved on 3 April 2014 and includes a series of observations which form an
integral part of the discharge Decision (please refer to the summary of the opinion of 3 April 2014).
The resolution recalled, inter alia, that Parliaments budget accounted for EUR 1 718 million which represents 20% of the amount set aside for
the 2012 administrative expenditure of the Union institutions as a whole).

2013/2196(DEC) - 03/04/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
Noting that the Secretary-General certified, on 6 September 2013, his reasonable assurance that Parliament's budget has been implemented
in accordance with the principles of sound financial management and that the control framework put in place provides the necessary
guarantees as to the legality and regularity of the underlying operations, the European Parliament adopted by 458 votes to 102, with 49
abstentions, a decision to grant discharge to its President in respect of the implementation of the European Parliament budget for the financial
year 2012.
In accordance with Article 177(4) of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament, the final vote on the resolution was postponed until
the next plenary session by 431 votes to 154, with 13 abstentions.

2013/2196(DEC) - 16/04/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 365 votes to 190, with 82 abstentions, a resolution accompanying the discharge decision aiming to grant
discharge to its President in respect of the implementation of the European Parliament budget for the financial year 2012.
The decision to grant discharge was adopted on 3 April 2014 (please refer to the summary of the same date). The final vote on the resolution
had been postponed to a later date.
Added value of the discharge procedure: in its resolution, Parliament highlighted the added value of the parliamentary procedure leading up to
the annual Parliament discharge. It pointed out that this resolution remains principally focussed on the budget implementation and discharge
for the financial year 2012 and that its main goal is to ensure that taxpayers' public money is used in the best possible w ay while highlighting
where improvements can be made.
Parliament's 2012 budgetary and financial management: Parliament noted that the Union general budget for 2012 totalled EUR 148.2 billion
million in commitment appropriations, of which Parliament's budget accounted for EUR 1.718 billion (20% of the amount set aside for the 2012
administrative expenditure of the Union institutions as a whole). It noted that authorised appropriations in Parliament's final budget for 2012
represented a 1.9% increase over the 2011 budget and that 99% of the final current appropriations were committed, with a cancellation rate of
1%.
Parliament's report on budgetary and financial management: Parliament noted that Parliament decided to conduct an end-of-year
"mopping-up" transfer from various budget lines amounting to EUR 45 000 000 in unspent funds intended for the second instalment of the
acquisition of the Trebel building in Brussels (EUR 35 000 000) and the construction of the new KAD building in Luxembourg. It stated that as

a result of this, an estimated EUR 10.4 million in financing charges will be saved over the construction and loan amortisation periods. It
deplored, nevertheless, the fact that Parliament has repeatedly requested that in the interest of budgetary clarity, buildings expenditure be
entered in the budget rather than being financed through a "mopping-up" transfer as requested in several previous discharge resolutions.
Court of Auditors' opinions on the reliability of the EPs 2012 accounts: overall, Parliament welcomed the fact that the Court of Auditors found
that the testing of transactions indicates that the most likely error present in the population is nil and that the supervisory and control systems
of the administrative expenditure were assessed as effective. It also welcomed the positive opinion as regards the DGs audits and insisted on
transparency as regards the entire process leading to the discharge procedure to ensure that citizens of the Union are provided with a true and
accurate view of the way that Parliament takes its decisions and uses the resources placed at its disposal.
Code of conduct and conflicts of interest: Parliament recalled that the Code of Conduct for Parliament's Members with respect to financial
interests and conflicts of interest requires Members to fully disclose any remunerated activities outside Parliament, the remuneration they
receive and any other function they perform which may give rise to conflicts of interest and that the code expressly prohibits Members from
accepting any sum of money or other gift in exchange for influencing Parliament decisions . It noted that it lays down clear rules on accepting
gifts and on former Members engaging in lobbying. The committee asked that the administration scrutinises at least 15% of these declarations
on a regular and annual basis.
Members daily subsistence allowance: in a series of amendments adopted in plenary, Members stated that they believed Parliament to be the
only European public institution that pays an allowance intended to meet the costs of office administration into private and personal bank
accounts without requiring any receipts to be kept or the auditing of the expenditure. Parliament suspected that Members would be deeply
critical of any other body that similarly failed to supervise the use of public money. It called therefore on the Secretary-General to propose light
touch arrangements to ensure that the General Expenditure Allowance is used for the purpose intended and cannot provide a supplementary
private income for Members. It requested an evaluation of the daily subsistence allowance for Members concerning its amount and use and
requested that the Bureau revise this implementing measure accordingly to ensure that this allowance is used in as cost-efficient a manner as
possible.
The President's political activities: Parliament called for detailed information on how the President, as a politically neutral figure, has kept his
duties in office separate from his preparations to head the Socialists and Democrats' list in the European elections, in particular with regard to
the staff in his cabinet and in Parliament's information offices and to travel expenses. It considered that in connection with many of those
activities, no distinction has been made between the two roles and called for clear segregation of office holders' functions, following the
Commission's approach, so that Union taxpayers do not have to pay for the election campaigns of European list leaders .
Awards, prizes and other issues: Parliament considered prizes not to be a core activity of Parliament and requested that a cost-benefit
analysis be carried out before any new prize initiatives are developed. Plenary also suggested, where appropriate, for Members' air travel
within Europe, the use of economy class tickets should be encouraged.
It also noted that some requests made in the annual discharge reports endorsed by Parliament's plenary are not met. It insisted that plenary
requests made in the annual discharge reports are fully implemented.
Working places of Parliament: Parliament recalled that significant historical reasons motivated the seat of the Parliament to be established and
that the question of determination of the seat of a Union institution is the exclusive competence of the Member States. It noted that the
expenditure arising from the geographic dispersion of Parliament constitutes an important identified area of potential savings and welcomed
the Secretary-Generals report of August 2013 regarding the financial impact of the geographic dispersion of the European Parliament. The
report expressed a theoretical net saving when consolidating the three places of work into one, in Brussels, at estimated EUR 88.9 million per
year which represents roughly 5% of Parliament's budget in 2014, 1.03% of the total administrative budget of the Union, and 0.06% of the
overall budget of the Union (the estimated net effect per Union citizen per year of EUR 0.18 if the three places of work of the Parliament were
to be consolidated into one). In addition, 10 703 tonnes of CO2 emissions per year would be saved if Strasbourg (10 235) and Luxembourg
(468) were no longer used as places of work. In this context, Members are looking forward to the publication of the Court of Auditors study to
provide a comprehensive analysis of the potential savings for the Union budget if Parliament had only one working place, as requested in its
resolution of 20 November 2013 on the location of the seats of the European Unions Institutions.
Management of Parliament's administration: strengthening operational efficiency: Parliament called on its responsible bodies to continue
improving, at all possible levels, efficiency in Parliament's daily work. It considered that during the 2009-2014 legislative term, in a difficult
economic and financial context, often random and temporary, although significant, savings were achieved. It also believed that its
administration should identify additional efficiency measures that carry systematic and definitive structural savings, firstly by reducing
Parliament's budget and secondly by allowing for the redeployment of resources to Parliament's new areas of intervention, notably to reinforce
the scrutiny dimension over the Commissions implementation of the Unions policies. Members also called on Parliament's administration to
consider increasing the use of the available technologies such as teleconferences and teleworking in order to reduce the administrative and
travelling costs.
In parallel, Parliament made a series of recommendations aimed towards certain Parliament DGs, in particular the following:
DG Presidency by highlighting difficulties in the appointment of the Director-General for this post;
DG for External Policies by recalling that because of general calls for thrift, the interparliamentary delegations might become less able
to maintain Parliaments external relations profile, enabling it to remain as visible as the other Union institutions, especially the
Commission and the Council, and that the effect might be to undermine the parliamentary approach to external policy and the
consolidation of parliamentary diplomacy, especially at times of political instability and danger to democracy (the Arab Spring, conflict
in the Middle East, conflict in Ukraine, run-up to controversial elections, etc.) and by strongly recommending that the appropriate level
of coordination with the EEAS services for the preparation and effective capacity response be ensured to guarantee the security
aspects of Parliament's external delegations and missions;
DG Communication pointing out that: (i) the inconsistency of cash payments to visitors groups although Parliaments administration
encourages payment by bank transfer or a mix of both methods instead; (ii) the amount of running costs of the "House of European
History" (EUR 800 000/year); (iii) EuroparlTV whose funding amounts to EUR 5 million in 2014 while the project is not a core activity of
Parliament and requests that a cost-benefit analysis be carried out before any new EuroparlTV activities are developed;
DG infrastructure noting that repairing the ceiling support frame in Parliaments Brussels Chamber will involve costs just above EUR 2
million and acknowledging that the regular on-going inspection and preventive maintenance policy for Parliaments buildings
introduced in 2012 detected the structural defects in the wooden ceiling beams, thus preventing a major disaster, potentially including
the loss of life and huge damage to the building in question;

DGIT stressing that personal and confidential individual mail-boxes of selected Members, parliamentary assistants and officials have
been compromised after the Parliament has been subject to a man-in-the-middle attack where a hacker has captured the
communication between private smartphones and the public Wi-Fi of the Parliament. In this regard, Members ask that all
