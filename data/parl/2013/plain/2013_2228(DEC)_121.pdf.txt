PURPOSE: presentation by the Commission of the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2012, as part of
the 2012 discharge procedure.
Analysis of the accounts of the European Railway Agency (ERA).
CONTENT: this Commission document sets out the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2012 as
prepared on the basis of the information presented by the institutions, organisations and bodies of the EU, in accordance with Article 129 (2) of
the Financial Regulation applicable to the EU's General Budget, including the European Railway Agency (ERA).
In 2012, the tasks and budget of this agency were as follows:
description of ERA's tasks: ERA, which is located in Lille-Valenciennes, was created by Regulation (EC) No 881/2004 of the European
Parliament and of the Council. Its aim is to : (i) enhance the level of interoperability of railway systems and; (ii) develop a common
approach to safety in order to contribute to creating a more competitive European railway sector with a high level of safety;
ERA's budget for the 2012 financial year: the Agencys budget for 2012, as presented in the Commission document on the
consolidated annual accounts of the European Union, gives the following figures:
§

- committed : EUR 26 million;
- paid : EUR 25 million;

2013/2228(DEC) - 10/09/2013 Court of Auditors: opinion, report

PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the European Railway Agency (ERA) for the year 2012,
together with the Agencys reply.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit concerned, amongst others, the annual accounts of the European Railway Agency (ERA).
In the Courts opinion, ERAs Annual Accounts fairly present, in all material respects, its financial position as of 31 December 2012 and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions of its Financial Regulation and the
accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
The Court also considers that the transactions underlying the annual accounts of the Agency for the financial year ended 31 December 2012
are, in all material respects, legal and regular.
The report confirms that the Agencys 2012 budget amounted to EUR 25.8 million.
The report also makes a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of the Agency, accompanied by the latters
response. The main observations may be summarised as follows:
The Courts observations:
Audit and internal controls: the Court states that the Agency has suppressed the internal audit capability and has replaced it with an
internal control coordinator. The Agency does not comply with its internal control standard regarding business continuity.
The Agencys reply:
·

audits : the Agency is planning to recruit an internal control coordinator before autumn 2013. This will be a separate function and as
such, the independence of the person exercising this role will be ensured. The Commission Internal audit Service continues to be the
Internal auditor of the Agency today and also for the future. It performs regular internal audits within the Agency.

Lastly, the Court of Auditors report contains a summary of the Agencys activities in 2012. This is focused on the adoption of recommendations
on:
·

safety certification ;

·

safety regulation, including evaluating the way national safety rules are made available, and examination of the transposition of the
Railway Safety Directive in the Member States ;

·

safety assessment, including common safety methods ;

·

technical specifications for interoperability.

It has also drawn up reports on common approaches with regard to vocational competencies and a reference document of national rules for
vehicle authorisation and classification of their equivalence for cross acceptance.

2013/2228(DEC) - 20/03/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Petri SARVAMAA (EPP, FI) in which it recommended the European Parliament to
grant discharge to the Executive Director of the European Railway Agency (ERA) in respect of the implementation of the Agency's budget for
the financial year 2012.
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the Agency for the financial
year 2012 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Members approved the closure of ERAs accounts. They
made, however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is granted, in addition to the general
recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies.
Budget and financial management: Members noted that budget monitoring efforts during the financial year 2012 resulted in a budget
implementation rate of 94.92% and that the payment appropriations execution rate was 85.63%.
Two locations: Members deplored the fact that using two locations (Lille and Valenciennes) to carry out its activities exposes the
Agency to additional costs. They acknowledged the efforts made by the Agency to minimise the negative impact of the decision on its
seat and called for a single location for the Agency, in a place easily accessible by public transport in order to save scare resources
and increase its efficiency.
Members also made a series of observations on transfers, procurement and recruitment procedures as well as comments on internal controls.
Lastly, Members stated that the Agency should review its policy on the prevention and management of conflicts of interests in 2014 on the
basis of Commission's Guidelines on the matter and inform the discharge authority on the assessment results once available.
