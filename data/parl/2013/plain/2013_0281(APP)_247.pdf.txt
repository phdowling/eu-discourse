OJ L 076 20.03.2015, p. 0001 Summary

2013/0281(APP) - 09/08/2013 Initial legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to repeal, from 1 January 2014, Council Decision 2007/124/EC, Euratom establishing for the period 2007 to 2013 the Specific
Programme ?Prevention, Preparedness and Consequence Management of Terrorism and other Security-related risks'.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: under the multiannual framework 2007-13, the General Programme on Security and Safeguarding Liberties was established
with its main objective being to ensure effective operational cooperation in the fight against terrorism, including its consequences, organised
crime and general crime, to support the provision of intelligence on a European scale and to strengthen the prevention of crime and terrorism,
in order to promote secure societies based on the rule of law.
Given that these objectives had different legal bases in the Treaties and fundamentally different legal regimes, the General Programme was
composed of two different legal instruments.
1. Council Decision 2007/125/JHA established the Specific Programme ?Prevention of and Fight against Crime' (?ISEC specific
programme'). The specific programme focused on four thematic areas: crime prevention and criminology, law enforcement, protection
and support to witnesses, and protection of victims.
2. Council Decision 2007/124/EC, Euratom established the Specific Programme ?Prevention, Preparedness and Consequence
Management of Terrorism and other Security related risks' (?CIPS specific programme'). Its general objective was to support Member
States' efforts to prevent, prepare for, and protect people and critical infrastructure against terrorist attacks and other security-related
incidents.
IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken.
LEGAL BASIS: Article 352 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and Article 203 of the Treaty establishing the
European Atomic Energy Community.
CONTENT: within the comprehensive framework of the Internal Security Fund, the instrument for financial support for police cooperation,
preventing and combating crime, and crisis management (?the ISF-Police') will provide financial support for police cooperation, exchange of

and access to information, crime prevention and the fight against cross-border and serious and organised crime, including terrorism, the
protection of people and critical infrastructure against security-related incidents and the effective management of security-related risks and
crises.
Consequently, the ISEC and CIPS specific programmes providing financial support for this policy area under the multiannual framework
2007-13 have to be repealed with effect from 1 January 2014, subject to transitional rules.
As far as the ISEC specific programme is concerned, it is repealed by the Regulation establishing the ISF-Police.
As for the CIPS specific programme, it was not possible to do the same because its repeal requires a separate legal act, due to the different
voting rules under its double legal base (EC/Euratom). However, the final provision concerning the entry into force of this Decision is drafted in
such a way that the repeal of the CIPS specific programme will coincide with the entry into force of the Regulation establishing the ISF-Police.
Therefore, the repeal of the CIPS and ISEC specific programmes will be dealt with in exactly the same way.
The Commission proposes that the Decision establishing the CIPS specific programme be repealed with effect from 1 January 2014.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this proposal does not have any direct implication for the EU budget.

2013/0281(APP) - 12/11/2013 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to repeal, from 1 January 2014, Council Decision 2007/124/EC, Euratom establishing for the period 2007 to 2013 the Specific
Programme Prevention, Preparedness and Consequence Management of Terrorism and other Security-related risks'.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: under the multiannual framework 2007-13, the General Programme on Security and Safeguarding Liberties was established
with its main objective being to ensure effective operational cooperation in the fight against terrorism, including its consequences, organised
crime and general crime, to support the provision of intelligence on a European scale and to strengthen the prevention of crime and terrorism,
in order to promote secure societies based on the rule of law.
Given that these objectives had different legal bases in the Treaties and fundamentally different legal regimes, the General Programme was
composed of two different legal instruments:
Council Decision 2007/125/JHA established the Specific Programme Prevention of and Fight against Crime' (ISEC specific
programme'). The specific programme focused on four thematic areas: crime prevention and criminology, law enforcement, protection
and support to witnesses, and protection of victims;
Council Decision 2007/124/EC, Euratom established the Specific Programme Prevention, Preparedness and Consequence
Management of Terrorism and other Security related risks' (CIPS specific programme'). Its general objective was to support Member
States' efforts to prevent, prepare for, and protect people and critical infrastructure against terrorist attacks and other security-related
incidents.
As for the CIPS specific programme, it repeal requires a separate legal act, due to the different voting rules under its double legal base
(EC/Euratom).
CONTENT: this proposal seeks to repeal Decision 2007/124/EC, Euratom from 1 January 2014.
Within the comprehensive framework of the Internal Security Fund, the instrument for financial support for police cooperation, preventing and
combating crime, and crisis management (the ISF-Police') will provide financial support for police cooperation, exchange of and access to
information, crime prevention and the fight against cross-border and serious and organised crime, including terrorism, the protection of people
and critical infrastructure against security-related incidents and the effective management of security-related risks and crises. The Funds would
therefore take over the CIPS Programme.
As far as the ISEC specific programme is concerned, it is repealed by the Regulation establishing the ISF-Police.
Reporting: N.B.: this new version of the text no longer includes an article requiring Member States to submit to the Commission by 30 June
2015 an evaluation report on the results and impacts of actions co-financed by Council Decision 2007/124/EC, Euratom for the period 2011 to
2013.
However, the article stating that the Commission shall submit to the European Parliament and to the Council, by 31 December 2015, a report
on the results achieved and on quantitative aspects of the implementation of Decision 2007/124/EC, Euratom for the period from 2011 to 2013
has been maintained.

2013/0281(APP) - 04/12/2013 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs adopted, in the framework of a special legislative procedure (Parliaments consent),
the report by Juan Fernando LÓPEZ AGUILAR (S&S, ES) on the draft Council decision repealing Decision 2007/124/EC, Euratom establishing
for the period 2007 to 2013, as part of General Programme on Security and Safeguarding Liberties, the Specific Programme 'Prevention,
Preparedness and Consequence Management of Terrorism and other Security related risks'.

2013/0281(APP) - 17/03/2015 Final act
PURPOSE: to repeal, from 1 January 2014, Council Decision 2007/124/EC, Euratom establishing for the period 2007 to 2013 the Specific
Programme Prevention, Preparedness and Consequence Management of Terrorism and other Security-related risks'.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Council Decision (EU, Euratom) 2015/457 repealing Decision 2007/124/EC, Euratom establishing for the period 2007 to
2013, as part of General Programme on Security and Safeguarding Liberties, the Specific Programme Prevention, Preparedness and
Consequence Management of Terrorism and other Security related risks.
CONTENT: Council Decision 2007/124/EC, Euratom established the Specific Programme Prevention, Preparedness and Consequence
Management of Terrorism and other Security related risks covering the period from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013.
A new regulation providing for financial support for police cooperation, preventing and combating crime, and crisis management as part of the
Internal Security Fund is to be established for the period from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020 by Regulation (EU) No 513/2014 of the
European Parliament and of the Council.
Therefore, Decision 2007/124/EC, Euratom should therefore be repealed with effect from 1 January 2014.
The repeal of the Decision shall not affect the continuation or modification, including the total or partial cancellation, of projects covered by the
Programme until their closure, or the financial assistance approved by the Commission on the basis of Decision 2007/124/EC, Euratom, or any
other legal acts applying to that financial assistance on 31 December 2013.
The Commission shall submit, by 31 December 2015, a report on the results achieved and on quantitative aspects of the implementation of
Decision 2007/124/EC, Euratom for the period from 2011 to 2013.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: the same day as Regulation (EU) No 513/2014.
