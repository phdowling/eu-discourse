Summary

2013/2135(INI) - 27/03/2013 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: to open a debate on the 2030 framework for climate and energy policies (Green Paper).
BACKGROUND: the EU has a clear framework to steer its energy and climate policies up to 2020 . In parallel, the EU has put in place a
regulatory framework to drive the creation of an open, integrated and competitive single market for energy which promotes the security of
energy supplies. While the EU is making good progress towards meeting the 2020 targets, creating the internal market for energy and meeting
other objectives of energy policy, there is a need now to reflect on a new 2030 framework for climate and energy policies.
Early agreement on the 2030 framework is important for three reasons: (i) long investment cycles mean that infrastructure funded in the near
term will still be in place in 2030 and beyond and investors therefore need certainty and reduced regulatory risk; (ii) clarifying the objectives for
2030 will support progress towards a competitive economy and a secure energy system by creating more demand for efficient and low carbon
technologies and spurring research, development and innovation, which can create new opportunities; (iii) while negotiations for a legally
binding international agreement on climate mitigation have been difficult, an international agreement is still expected by the end of 2015, the
EU will have to agree on a series of issues, including its own ambition level, in advance of this date in order to engage actively with other
countries.
This framework for 2030 must be sufficiently ambitious but it must also reflect a number of important changes that have taken place since the
original framework was agreed in 2008/9:
(i) the consequences of the on-going economic crisis; (ii) the budgetary problems of Member States and businesses; (iii) developments on EU
and global energy markets; (iv) concerns of households about the affordability of energy and of businesses with respect to competitiveness; (v)
and the varying levels of commitment and ambition of international partners in reducing GHG emissions.
The 2030 framework must draw on the lessons from the current framework: what has worked, what has not worked and what can be
improved. It should also take into account the longer term perspective which the Commission laid out in 2011 in the Roadmap for moving to a
competitive low carbon economy in 2050, the Energy Roadmap 2050, and the Transport White Paper. The European Parliament has adopted
resolutions on each of the Roadmaps.
CONTENT: this Green Paper gives an overview of the current framework and what has been achieved and then presents the issues where
stakeholder input is sought. The experience and views of stakeholders, backed up where possible with sound evidence, are essential on four
broad issues: targets; other policy instruments; competiveness; and the different capacity of Member States to act.
(1) Targets: fundamental issues for a new 2030 framework for climate and energy policies concern the following issues:
the types, nature and level of targets and how they interact. Should the targets be at EU, national or sectoral level and be legally
binding;
identify inconsistences in the current 2020 targets and ensure that the coherence of potential 2030 targets can be better ensured;
examine the need for sub-sectors such as those set out for transport, agriculture, industry appropriate and, if so, which ones? For
example, is a renewables target necessary for transport, given the targets for CO2 reductions for passenger cars and light commercial
vehicles;
identify how targets can reflect better the economic viability and the changing degree of maturity of technologies in the 2030

framework;
address the issue of whether having only a GHG emissions target for 2030 would be appropriate, taking into account other objectives
such as security of supply and competitiveness;
assess progress for other aspects of EU energy policy, such as security of supply, which may not be captured by the headline targets.
(2) Coherence of policy instruments: a combination of instruments is likely to be needed to address the different policy goals and market
barriers. These instruments will interact with one another. The 2030 policy framework should, therefore, strike a balance between concrete
implementing measures at EU level and Member States' flexibility to meet targets in ways which are most appropriate to national
circumstances, while being consistent with the internal market.
The main issues to be examined are as follows:
examine if changes are necessary to other policy instruments and how they interact with one another, including between the EU and
national levels;
define how specific measures at the EU and national level should be defined to optimise cost-efficiency of meeting climate and energy
objectives;
avoid fragmentation of the internal energy market particularly in relation to the need to encourage and mobilise investment;
envisage which measures could make further energy savings most cost-effectively;
identify how EU research and innovation policies can best support the achievement of the 2030 framework.
(3) Fostering the competitiveness of the EU economy: one of the fundamental objectives of EU energy policy is to ensure that the energy
system contributes to the competitiveness of the EU economy. Energy and climate policies can drive demand and growth in the low carbon
economy. Issues to be dealt with are:
the elements of the framework for climate and energy policies to be strengthened to better promote job creation, growth and
competitiveness;
the identification of evidence that there is carbon leakage under the current framework and how this problem could be addressed;
the extent to which the EU can influence specific drivers in observed trends in energy costs;
take account of uncertainties about efforts that other developed countries and economically important developing nations will make in
the on-going international negotiations;
enhancing the regulatory certainty for business while building in flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances (e.g. progress in
international climate negotiations and changes in energy markets);
the increase of innovation capacity of manufacturing industry and the role for the revenues from the auctioning of allowances;
the EUs exploitation of the development of indigenous conventional and unconventional energy sources within the Member States to
contribute to reduced energy prices and import dependency;
the EUs contribution to improving security of energy supply internally by ensuring the full and effective functioning of the internal
energy market (e.g. through the development of necessary interconnections), and externally by diversifying energy supply routes.
(4) Acknowledging the differing capacity of Member States: Member States are very diverse in terms of comparative wealth, industrial
structure, energy mix, building stocks, carbon and energy intensity, exploitable renewable resources, and social structure. Individual consumer
groups have different capacities to invest and adapt. This diversity must be taken into account when developing :
concrete steps to be taken to reflect their different abilities to implement climate and energy measures;
mechanisms to promote cooperation and a fair effort sharing between Member States whilst seeking the most cost-effective delivery
of new climate and energy objectives;
the need for new financing instruments or arrangements required to support the new 2030 framework.
The consultation with stakeholders will be open until 2 July 2013.

2013/2135(INI) - 27/01/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy jointly adopted the
report drafted by Anne DELVAUX (EPP, BE) and Konrad SZYMA?SKI (ECR, PL) on a 2030 framework for climate and energy policies.
Investors and industries urgently need a clear long-term framework for EU climate and energy policy with greater levels of certainty, and thus
clear price signals, in order to encourage medium- and long-term sustainable investment, reduce the associated risk and take advantage of
opportunities on the global market for sustainable technologies.
Targets: a multi-faceted approach based on mutually reinforcing, coordinated and coherent policies and ambitious binding targets for the
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy sources and energy efficiency is called for by the Members.
The Commission and the Member States are called upon to:
take greater advantage of the interactions between these three targets, providing investment certainty, and boosting and
strengthening competitiveness and energy security in the EU;
set a binding EU 2030 target of reducing domestic greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40 %; set a binding EU 2030 energy
efficiency target of 40 %; set a binding EU 2030 target of producing at least 30 % of total final energy consumption from renewable
energy sources;
ensure that early agreement on the 2030 framework for climate and energy policies in order for the EU to prepare itself for
international negotiations on a new, legally binding international agreement and provide a clear, legally binding framework and targets
for making the necessary medium- and long-term investment in emissions reduction, energy efficiency and renewable energy.
Coherence of policy instruments: the 2030 framework for climate and energy policies should incorporate instruments available within EU
regional policy in order to achieve the 2030 targets, and that this should include better use of the European Structural and Investment Funds
for the development of decentralised renewable energy projects, clean fuel projects in urban and rural areas and energy efficiency projects.
Energy security: on hydraulic fracturing, when coming forward with legislation on hydraulic fracturing, the Commission is called upon to include

a mandatory environmental impact assessment for both the exploration and extraction of shale gas and to ensure transparency as regards all
data on the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process.
Members proposed appropriate measures within the 2030 framework in order to mobilise stakeholders and the necessary funding as regards
the development of CCS technologies in the EU. The Commission is called upon to give more prominence and support to the great offshore
wind potential of the North Sea as well as to active forestry.
The EU at the international level: the report called for energy agreements with third countries to be concluded at the EU level and for EU
energy policy objectives to be firmly established. Members stressed that the continuation of this policy through the adoption of binding
renewable energy targets for 2030 would enable the EU to compete with China, the US, South Korea, Japan and India for technology
leadership in tomorrow's markets, even in times of economic constraints. The report insisted on the need to build a coherent financial
architecture for climate change. It also called on the Member States and the other parties in the upcoming international negotiations, in
anticipation of a potential binding agreement, to address the issue of carbon leakage at the global level.
Lastly, Members called for better coordination between the Council, the Commission and the European External Action Service so that the EU
can speak with one voice in international organisations and play a more active role, and have greater influence, in promoting sustainable
policies.

2013/2135(INI) - 05/02/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 341 votes to 263, with 26 abstentions a resolution on a 2030 framework for climate and energy policies.
Parliament welcomed the Commission Green Paper on a 2030 framework for climate and energy policies. It expected the European Council to
address these issues with ambitious responses. It regretted, however, that the Commissions communication A policy framework for climate
and energy in the period from 2020 to 2030 is short-sighted and unambitious on a number of levels, specifically as regards the lack of national
targets for renewable energy and of any meaningful new action to incentivise energy efficiency.
Parliament insisted that the Commission should base any legal proposal under full codecision between Parliament and the Council.
Targets: Parliament called for a multi-faceted approach based on mutually reinforcing, coordinated and coherent policies and ambitious
binding targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy sources and energy efficiency.
The Commission and the Member States are called upon to set:
a binding EU 2030 target of reducing domestic greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% compared with 1990 levels
a binding EU 2030 energy efficiency target of 40%, in line with research on cost-effective energy saving potential;
a binding EU 2030 target of producing at least 30% of total final energy consumption from renewable energy sources.
All sectors of the economy will need to contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions if the EU is to deliver its fair share of global efforts.
Parliament stressed the importance of ensuring that early agreement on the 2030 framework for climate and energy policies in order for the
EU to prepare itself for international negotiations on a new, legally binding international agreement and provide Member States and industry
with clear targets so that they can make the necessary medium- and long-term investment in emissions reduction, energy efficiency and
renewable energy.
Members were convinced that the best way of securing the EUs current and future energy needs is a balanced and differentiated energy mix,
which reduces dependence on single sources of energy without creating new forms of dependence, bearing in mind that the Commission
advises reducing our fossil energy dependence.
Coherence of policy instruments: Parliament emphasised the need for a comprehensive analysis of tools and targets, and of their coherence,
so as to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market. It stressed that the greenhouse gas emissions target must be ambitious enough
to provide additional incentives beyond those already existing, and be in line with the reduction levels considered scientifically necessary to
avoid dangerous climate change.
The 2030 framework for climate and energy policies should incorporate instruments available within EU regional policy in order to achieve the
2030 targets, and that this should include better use of the European Structural and Investment Funds for the development of decentralised
renewable energy projects, clean fuel projects in urban and rural areas and energy efficiency projects.
Energy security: Parliament stressed the need to ensure the energy security and eventual self-sufficiency of the EU. One of the priorities in this
regard would be to develop a model of cooperation between the Member States by ensuring the swift completion of the EU internal energy
market, including, in particular, the construction of interconnectors and the elimination of cross-border barriers.
As regards hydraulic fracturing, when coming forward with legislation on hydraulic fracturing, Parliament called on the Commission to include a
mandatory environmental impact assessment for both the exploration and extraction of shale gas and to ensure transparency as regards all
data on the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process.
Members proposed appropriate measures within the 2030 framework in order to mobilise stakeholders and the necessary funding as regards
the development of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies in the EU. They called on the Commission to give more prominence and
support to the great offshore wind potential of the North Sea as well as to active forestry.
The EU at the international level: Parliament called for energy agreements with third countries to be concluded at the EU level and for EU
energy policy objectives to be firmly established. It stressed the need to ensure, as a priority, that developed countries cut their own emissions
first and fast, and provide the necessary financial flows to developing countries for adaptation and mitigation.
It also stressed that the continuation of this policy through the adoption of binding renewable energy targets for 2030 would enable the EU to
compete with China, the US, South Korea, Japan and India for technology leadership in tomorrow's markets, even in times of economic
constraints. The resolution insisted on the need to build a coherent financial architecture for climate change. It also called on the Member
States and the other parties in the upcoming international negotiations, in anticipation of a potential binding agreement, to address the issue of
carbon leakage at the global level.

Lastly, Members called for better coordination between the Council, the Commission and the European External Action Service so that the EU
can speak with one voice in international organisations and play a more active role, and have greater influence, in promoting sustainable
policies.
