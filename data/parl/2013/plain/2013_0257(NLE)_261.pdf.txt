States, of the one part, and Georgia of the other part, concerning the participation of Georgia in Union programmes.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: as part of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), the gradual opening-up of certain Union programmes and agencies to
the participation of ENP partner countries represents one of many measures to promote reform, modernisation and transition in the European
Union's neighbourhood. The Commission outlined this policy aspect more extensively in its Communication on the general approach to enable
European Neighbourhood Policy partner countries to participate in Community agencies and Community programmes.
The Council endorsed this approach in conclusions on 5 March 2007.
Based upon this Communication and those conclusions, the Council, on 18 June 2007, issued directives to the Commission to negotiate
Framework Agreements with Algeria, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Egypt, Georgia, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Moldova, Morocco, the Palestinian
Authority, Tunisia and Ukraine, on the general principles for their participation in Community programmes.
The Joint Communication by the Commission and the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy "A
new response to a changing Neighbourhood", endorsed by Council Conclusions on 20 June 2011, further stressed the EU's intention to
facilitate partner countries' participation in EU programmes.

In December 2012, Georgia expressed its interest to participate in the broad range of programmes open to partner countries of the European
Neighbourhood Policy.
The Council is invited to adopt the following proposed Decision.

date.
According to Article 218(6)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the European Parliament shall be requested to give its
consent to the conclusion of this Protocol.
In parallel, the Commission submits a proposal for a Council Decision on the signature and provisional application of the said Protocol.
The text of the Protocol is attached to this Decision.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implication for the EU budget. Georgia shall contribute financially to the general budget of
the European Union corresponding to the specific programmes in which Georgia participates.
To finance its participation, the country may request assistance under the Regulation establishing a European Neighbourhood and Partnership
Instrument or pursuant to any similar Regulation providing for external assistance of the Union to Georgia.
