prepared on the basis of the information presented by the institutions, organisations and bodies of the EU, in accordance with Article 129 (2) of

2013/2237(DEC) - 10/09/2013 Court of Auditors: opinion, report

PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the European Banking Authoritiy (EBA) for the year
2012, together with the EBAs reply.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit concerned, amongst others, the annual accounts of the European Banking Authority (EBA).
In the Courts opinion, the EBAs Annual Accounts fairly present, in all material respects, its financial position as of 31 December 2012 and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions of its Financial Regulation and the
accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
The Court also considers that the transactions underlying the annual accounts of the Authority for the financial year ended 31 December 2012
are, in all material respects, legal and regular.
The report confirms that the Authoritys 2012 budget amounted to EUR 20.7 million.
The report also makes a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of the Authority, accompanied by the latters
response. The main observations may be summarised as follows:
The Courts observations:
·

internal controls: the EBAs IT core application systems were outsourced to an external IT provider until December 2013. This poses
risks related to the Authoritys limited control and supervision over its IT systems;

·

budgetary management: the Court notes large carry-overs;

·

recruitment procedures: the Court identified weaknesses in the audited recruitment procedures affecting transparency and equal
treatment:

The Authoritys reply:
·

in case of IT related carry-overs, this can be attributed to the start up stage of the Authority;

·

the EBA acknowledges the weaknesses identified by the Court and has promptly implemented the corrective measures. Since
January 2013, candidates are given a score for each of the selection criteria and evidence that the questions and tests have been
set before the date of the examinations is systematically included in the recruitment files.

Lastly, the Court of Auditors report contains a summary of the Authoritys activities in 2012. This is focused on the following:
public consultations on 23 draft regulatory and implementing technical standards;
submission to the Commission of the first draft regulatory technical standards on capital requirements for central counterparties under
European Market Infra-structure Regulation ;
issuance of six Guidelines, four Discussion Papers and 14 Consultation Papers ;
provision of 7 Opinions addressed to the Commission, European Parliament and Council, three comment letters on accounting issues
to the IASB/IFRS Foundation ;
drawing-up expert reports ;
performance of risk analysis, assessment and monitoring, and presenting risk reports to a wide range of stakeholders.

2013/2237(DEC) - 21/03/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Petri SARVAMAA (EPP, FI) in which it recommended the European Parliament to
grant discharge to the Executive Director of the European Banking Authority (EBA) in respect of the implementation of the Authoritys budget
for the financial year 2012.
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the Authority for the financial
year 2012 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Members approved the closure of the Authoritys accounts.
They made, however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is granted, in addition to the
general recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies.
Legality and regularity of transactions: Members noted that the Authority grants staff whose children attend primary or secondary
school a top-up allowance, which amounted to some EUR 76 000 in 2012. They noted that these allowances are not covered by the
Staff Regulations and are, therefore, considered irregular by the Court of Auditors. They acknowledged, however, that this situation is
due to the lack of European Schools in the city where the Authority is based.
Budget and financial management: Members noted that the overall level of appropriations committed was 89%, but carry-overs of
committed appropriations were high at 45% which was mainly due to reasons beyond the Authoritys control, such as the unsuccessful
attempt to find new premises and delays in the implementation of some IT projects for which it was difficult to obtain the information
needed from the predecessor organisation. Improvements should be made in the area of budgetary planning.
Members also made a series of observations on transfers, procurement and recruitment procedures as well as comments on internal controls.
Lastly, they welcomed the adoption of Ethics Guidelines by the Authority and acknowledged that it is finalising the preparation of its conflicts of
interests policy. They called on the Authority to inform the discharge authority of the adoption of that policy.

2013/2237(DEC) - 03/04/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading

The European Parliament adopted a decision concerning the discharge to be granted to the Executive Director of the European Banking
Authority (EBA) in respect of the implementation of the Authoritys budget for the financial year 2012. The vote on the discharge decision
approved the closure of the accounts (in accordance with Annex VI, Article 5(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament.
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the Authority for the financial
year 2012 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Parliament adopted by 506 votes to 77, with 15 abstentions,
a resolution containing a series of recommendations that form an integral part of the discharge decision and as well as the general
recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies.
These recommendations are summarised as follows:
Legality and regularity of transactions: Parliament noted that the Authority grants staff whose children attend primary or secondary
school a top-up allowance, which amounted to some EUR 76 000 in 2012. It noted that these allowances are not covered by the Staff
Regulations and are, therefore, considered irregular by the Court of Auditors. It acknowledged, however, that this situation is due to
the lack of European Schools in the city where the Authority is based.
Budget and financial management: Parliament noted that the overall level of appropriations committed was 89%, but carry-overs of
committed appropriations were high at 45% which was mainly due to reasons beyond the Authoritys control, such as the unsuccessful
attempt to find new premises and delays in the implementation of some IT projects for which it was difficult to obtain the information
needed from the predecessor organisation. Improvements should be made in the area of budgetary planning.
Performance: Parliament requested that the Authority communicate the results and impact its work has on European citizens in an
accessible way, mainly through its website.
Parliament also made a series of observations on transfers, procurement and recruitment procedures as well as comments on internal
controls.
Lastly, it welcomed the adoption of Ethics Guidelines by the Authority and acknowledged that it is finalising the preparation of its conflicts of
interests policy. It called on the Authority to inform the discharge authority of the adoption of that policy.
