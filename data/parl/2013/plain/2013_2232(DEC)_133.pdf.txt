PURPOSE: presentation by the Commission of the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2012, as part of

Analysis of the accounts of the European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA) formerly known as the CFCA.
CONTENT: this Commission document sets out the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2012 as
prepared on the basis of the information presented by the institutions, organisations and bodies of the EU, in accordance with Article 129 (2) of
the Financial Regulation applicable to the EU's General Budget, including the European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA).
In 2012, the tasks and budget of this agency were as follows:

task is to organise the operational coordination of fisheries control and inspection activities by the Member States in order to ensure

EFCA's's budget for the 2012 financial year: the Agencys budget for 2012, as presented in the Commission document on the
consolidated annual accounts of the European Union, gives the following figures:
§

Commitment appropriations :
- committed : EUR 9 million;
- paid : EUR 9 million;
- carried-over : 0.

§

Payment appropriations :
- committed : EUR 11 million;
- paid : EUR 10 million;

2013/2232(DEC) - 10/09/2013 Court of Auditors: opinion, report

PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA) for the
year 2012, together with the Agencys reply.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit concerned, amongst others, the annual accounts of the European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA).
In the Courts opinion, the European Fisheries Control Agencys Annual Accounts fairly present, in all material respects, its financial position as
of 31 December 2012 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions of its
Financial Regulation and the accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
The Court also considers that the transactions underlying the annual accounts of the Agency for the financial year ended 31 December 2012
are, in all material respects, legal and regular.
The report confirms that the Agencys 2012 budget amounted to EUR 9.22 million.
The report also makes a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of the Agency, accompanied by the latters
response. The main observations may be summarised as follows:
The Courts observations:
·

budgetary management: the Court notes that the high level of committed appropriations carried over to 2013 was caused, to a large
extent, by events beyond the Agencys control, such as the late invoicing of the 2012 office rental costs by the Spanish authorities.
On operational expenditure, an important reason for the high level of carry-overs was the considerable workload faced by the
Agency as a result of the large number of IT projects that were either launched or ongoing during 2012. This workload had an impact
on the timeliness of procurement procedures in the case of two IT projects launched in 2012.

The Agencys reply:
carry-overs: the Agency indicates careful consideration will be given to each new project with a view to optimising its lifecycle, in order
to avoid carryover of significant amounts.
Lastly, the Court of Auditors report contains a summary of the Agencys activities in 2012. This is focused on implementation of the Joint
Deployment Plan cod fishery in the North Sea,
Skagerrak, Kattegat and the Eastern Channel and Western Waters and JDP cod and salmon fisheries in the Baltic Sea. The Agency also
carried out:
mapping study on information systems supporting fisheries controls in the EU ;
operation, maintenance, enhancement and development of ICT monitoring capa-bilities: Vessel Monitoring System (VMS), Electronic
Reporting System (ERS), Fishnet ;
support activities to fight Illegal unreported and unregulated fisheries.

2013/2232(DEC) - 21/03/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Petri SARVAMAA (EPP, FI) in which it recommended the European Parliament to
grant discharge to the Executive Director of the European Fisheries Control Agency in respect of the implementation of the Agency's budget
for the financial year 2012.
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the Agency for the financial
year 2012 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Members approved the closure of the Agencys accounts.
They made, however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is granted, in addition to the
general recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies.
Budget and financial management: Members noted that budget monitoring efforts during the financial year 2012 resulted in a budget
implementation rate of 96% and that the payment appropriations execution rate was 83%.
Commitments and carryovers: Members noted, however, that the level of committed appropriations carried over to 2013 was high for
administrative expenditure at 35% and operating expenditure at 46%. This was due to a large extent by events beyond the Agencys
control, such as the late invoicing of the 2012 office rental costs by the Spanish authorities. An other important reason for the high
level of carry-overs was the considerable workload faced by the agency as a result of the large number of IT projects that were either
launched or ongoing in 2012 and this workload had an impact on the timeliness of procurement procedures in the case of two IT
projects launched in 2012.
Members also made a series of observations on transfers, procurement and recruitment procedures as well as comments on internal controls.
Lastly, they acknowledged that the Agency will assess its policy on the prevention and management of conflicts of interests on the basis of the
Commission's Guidelines on the Prevention and Management of Conflicts of Interests in EU Decentralised Agencies. They called on the
Agency to inform the discharge authority of the assessment results once available.

2013/2232(DEC) - 03/04/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading

year 2012 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Parliament adopted by 510 votes to 66, with 16 abstentions,
a resolution containing a series of recommendations that form an integral part of the discharge decision and as well as the general
recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies.
These recommendations are summarised as follows:
Budget and financial management: Parliament noted that budget monitoring efforts during the financial year 2012 resulted in a budget
implementation rate of 96% and that the payment appropriations execution rate was 83%.
Commitments and carryovers: it noted, however, that the level of committed appropriations carried over to 2013 was high for
administrative expenditure at 35% and operating expenditure at 46%. This was due to a large extent by events beyond the Agencys
control, such as the late invoicing of the 2012 office rental costs by the Spanish authorities. An other important reason for the high
level of carry-overs was the considerable workload faced by the agency as a result of the large number of IT projects that were either
launched or ongoing in 2012 and this workload had an impact on the timeliness of procurement procedures in the case of two IT
projects launched in 2012.
Performance: Parliament requested that the Agency communicate the results and impact its work has on European citizens in an
accessible way, mainly through its website.
It also made a series of observations on transfers, procurement and recruitment procedures as well as comments on internal controls.
Lastly, Parliament acknowledged that the Agency will assess its policy on the prevention and management of conflicts of interests on the basis
of the Commission's Guidelines on the Prevention and Management of Conflicts of Interests in EU Decentralised Agencies. It called on the
Agency to inform the discharge authority of the assessment results once available.
