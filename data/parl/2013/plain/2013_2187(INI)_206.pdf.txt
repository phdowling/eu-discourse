2013/2187(INI) - 25/03/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Foreign Affairs adopted the report by Graham WATSON (ADLE, UK) on the role of broadcasting media in projecting the EU
and its values.
European media broadcasting internationally can play an important role in communicating the values of democracy, media freedom and
human rights throughout the world, in explaining different national perceptions, in communicating EU policies, in shaping a genuine European
perspective and in providing audiences with reliable and high-quality information, most significantly by means of a firm and unyielding
commitment to journalistic objectivity.
Governments bear the primary responsibility for guaranteeing and protecting freedom of expression and the media. Members considered that
there is a need to establish a coherent European media broadcasting strategy in the EUs external relations.
Therefore, this report addressed the following recommendations to the Council, the Commission and the European External Action Service:
to understand the importance of free European media, and in particular of financially sustainable and independent public service
broadcasting, in promoting EU democratic values and informing the public about policies and goals in the sphere of the CFSP, notably
by enhancing understanding of the issues that unite and divide Europe and bringing European citizens closer together as regards their
understanding of foreign policy;
to establish a coherent and robust EU media broadcasting strategy in the context of the EUs external relations, thereby promoting
freedom of expression and media pluralism and upholding and strengthening democracy and human rights in Europe and in third
countries;
to define, as part of this strategy, a specific approach to European broadcasting media notwithstanding the independence of the
media and the competence of Member States to confer, define and organise the public service broadcasting remit;
to consider that Euronews, with its broad network of national broadcasters and its wide distribution, has the potential to play an
important role in the media landscape and in stimulating the debate on Europe, including in third countries. In order to play such a role
Euronews should have the means to continue to operate in various languages, including non-European languages;
to direct project-based EU external aid funding towards those broadcasters that already respect and work in accordance with the
highest standards of journalistic independence, accuracy and balance and promote EU values;
to launch a reflection process at EU level with the aim of establishing a worldwide European radio service;
to work towards the creation of an enabling media environment in third countries, along with the development of independent and
professional broadcasting media.

2013/2187(INI) - 02/04/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a recommendation to the Council, the Commission and the European External Action Service of 2 April
2014 on the role of broadcasting media in projecting the EU and its values.
Independent European broadcasting media offer the public in Europe and worldwide a joint vision, support the values enshrined in the EU
Treaties, such as human rights and fundamental freedoms, including freedom of expression, and promote pluralism, independent thought,
cultural diversity, plurality of vision and the fundamental value of fostering non-violent conflict resolution, tolerance and respect, both within the
EU and in the context of its external relations.
Parliament recalled that the EUs provision of initial funding for European Radio for Belarus and of continuous project-based support for
independent broadcasting media in third countries are good examples of promoting freedom of expression and other fundamental rights and
freedoms in the framework of the common foreign and security policy (CFSP).
Governments bear the primary responsibility for guaranteeing and protecting freedom of expression and the media. Parliament considered that
there is a need to establish a coherent European media broadcasting strategy in the EUs external relations.
Therefore, Parliament addressed the following recommendations to the Council, the Commission and the European External Action Service:
to understand the importance of free European media, and in particular of financially sustainable and independent public service
broadcasting, in promoting EU democratic values and informing the public about policies and goals in the sphere of the CFSP, notably
by enhancing understanding of the issues that unite and divide Europe and bringing European citizens closer together as regards their
understanding of foreign policy;
to establish a coherent and robust EU media broadcasting strategy in the context of the EUs external relations, thereby promoting
freedom of expression and media pluralism and upholding and strengthening democracy and human rights in Europe and in third
countries;
to define, as part of this strategy, a specific approach to European broadcasting media notwithstanding the independence of the
media and the competence of Member States to confer, define and organise the public service broadcasting remit. It encouraged
European media broadcasting internationally to: (i) operate in a pluralistic and competitive media environment having immediate
access to first-hand current news, being able to make use of the advantages of the latest technologies and staying at the forefront of
the digital revolution and create authentic and diversified content; (ii) be editorially independent; (iii) adhere to a broadcasting charter

requiring accurate and objective news coverage; (iv) offer a platform for the exchange of opinions and debate pertaining to socially
and/or politically relevant issues; (v) reflect appropriately the diversity of opinions and contexts in the EU.
to consider that Euronews (which receives, since 2005, core funding of EUR 5 million per year from the EU) , with its broad network of
national broadcasters and its wide distribution, has the potential to play an important role in the media landscape and in stimulating the
debate on Europe, including in third countries. In order to play such a role Euronews should have the means to continue to operate in
various languages, including non-European languages; be further strengthened financially and structurally in order to be able to
perform at a level comparable to that of worldwide news channels and to publish on its website an overview of its revenue so as to
provide transparency of its operations;
to direct project-based EU external aid funding towards those broadcasters that already respect and work in accordance with the
highest standards of journalistic independence, accuracy and balance and promote EU values;
to launch a reflection process at EU level with the aim of establishing a worldwide European radio service;
to work towards the creation of an enabling media environment in third countries, along with the development of independent and
professional broadcasting media.
to react swiftly when satellite signals from European media broadcasting internationally are jammed in third countries, and when
third-country governments suspend broadcasting by European media.
