Summary

The European Parliament adopted a resolution the situation match-fixing and corruption in sport.
The resolution was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ALDE, ECR, and Greens/EFA groups.
Noting that a Europol joint investigation team revealed widespread football match-fixing in recent years, with 380 matches in Europe deemed
suspicious, Parliament asks the Commission to develop a coordinated approach to the fight against match-fixing and organised crime , to
include coordinating the efforts of the main stakeholders. Parliament further asks the Commission to:
establish cooperation with third countries to combat the organised crime associated with match-fixing;
identify third countries such as those known as Asian betting havens that raise specific issues as regards betting-related match-fixing
in respect of sports events taking place within the EU and to increase its collaboration with those countries.
Member States are asked to:
explicitly include match-fixing in their national criminal law, and provide for common minimum sanctions;
create a specialised law enforcement unit to serve as a hub for communication and cooperation with the main stakeholders;
set up joint investigation teams and cooperation between prosecution authorities;
set up regulatory bodies and to collect and exchange evidence of match-fixing and sports fraud, both in Europe and beyond, with the
Commission facilitating the exchange of information between these regulatory bodies with regard to illegal or suspicious sports betting
activities.
Lastly, Members urge sports organisations to establish a code of conduct for all staff and officials which includes: (i) a clear prohibition on
manipulating matches, (ii) the associated sanctions (iii) a ban on gambling on own matches; (iv) an obligation to report any approaches
concerning match-fixing, coupled with an adequate whistleblower protection mechanism.
