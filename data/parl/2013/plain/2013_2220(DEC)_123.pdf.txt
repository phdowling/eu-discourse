2013/2220(DEC) - 26/07/2013 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: presentation by the Commission of the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2012, as part of
the 2012 discharge procedure.
Analysis of the accounts of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).
CONTENT: this Commission document sets out the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2012 as
prepared on the basis of the information presented by the institutions, organisations and bodies of the EU, in accordance with Article 129 (2) of
the Financial Regulation applicable to the EU's General Budget, including the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).
In 2012, the tasks and budget of this agency were as follows:
description of EFSA's tasks: EFSA, which is located in Parma, was established by Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European
Parliament and of the Council. Its main aim is to provide scientific opinions and scientific and technical support for the legislation and
policies which have a direct or indirect impact on food and feed safety;
EFSA's budget for the 2012 financial year: the Authoritys budget for 2012, as presented in the Commission document on the
consolidated annual accounts of the European Union, gives the following figures:
§

Commitment appropriations :
- committed : EUR 79 million;
- paid : EUR 78 million;
- carried-over : 0.

§

Payment appropriations :
- committed : EUR 90 million;
- paid : EUR 80 million;
- carried-over : EUR 9 million.

Please refer also to the final accounts of the EFSA.

2013/2220(DEC) - 10/09/2013 Court of Auditors: opinion, report
PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) for the year
2012, together with the Authoritys reply.

CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit concerned, amongst others, the annual accounts of the European Food Safety Authority.
In the Courts opinion, the European Food Safety Authoritys Annual Accounts fairly present, in all material respects, its financial position as of
31 December 2012 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions of its
Financial Regulation and the accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
The Court also considers that the transactions underlying the annual accounts of the Authority for the financial year ended 31 December 2012
are, in all material respects, legal and regular.
The report confirms that the Authoritys 2012 budget amounted to EUR 78.3 million.
The report also makes a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of the Authority, accompanied by the latters
response. The main observations may be summarised as follows:
The Courts observations:
·

audits and internal controls: a number of potential critical risks were identified in the operation of the Authoritys internal controls,
particularly in the areas of data management, business continuity and IT security;

·

budgetary management: the overall level of appropriations committed was 99 %, but the level of committed appropriations carried
over was high with operational expenditure at EUR 5.6 million (30 % of title III appropriations).

The Authoritys reply:
·

audits: as part of its management and internal control procedures the Authority carries out on a regular basis high level risk
assessments so as to identify and adopt adequate mitigation measures to potential risks. This exercise is a key internal control put in
place to increase the likelihood of achieving the Authoritys objectives. The Authority will continue enhancing such preventive
risk-based management approach;
budgetary management: the Authority will continue to improve the monitoring of the budget execution in order to keep the carry-over in
line with the budget execution objectives set for the operational activities

Lastly, the Court of Auditors report contains a summary of the Authoritys activities in 2012. This is focused on the following:
scientific opinions and advice, as well as information on risks relating to food safety;
evaluation of products, substances and claims subject to authorisation
data Collection, scientific cooperation and networking
publications and scientific outputs supported by communication activities.

2013/2220(DEC) - 21/03/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Petri SARVAMAA (EPP, FI) in which it recommended the European Parliament to
grant discharge to the Executive Director of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in respect of the implementation of the Authority's
budget for the financial year 2012.
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the Authority for the financial
year 2012 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Members approved the closure of EFSAs accounts. They
made, however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is granted, in addition to the general
recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies.
Budget and financial management: Members noted that budget monitoring efforts during the financial year 2012 resulted in a budget
implementation rate of 99.30% and that the payment appropriations execution rate was 88%. They acknowledged that the relocation
of the Authority to its new premises generated savings amounting to EUR 3.94 million and that that amount was reallocated to
operational activities.
Commitments and carryovers: Members noted that carryovers were high. They acknowledged that a high amount of carry-overs were
made for reasons beyond the Authoritys control. They recalled that the Authority should respect the principle of annuality.
Prevention and management of conflicts of interests and transparency: Members believed that the procedure for assessing possible
conflicts of interest at the Authority, where declarations of interest are screened by Heads of Unit and are generally assessed on a
case by case basis, is burdensome and is subject to criticism, raising questions about its credibility and effectiveness. They called on
the Authority to come up with a simplified procedure with less uncertainty which would validate and streamline the process and save
both human resources and money without, however, jeopardising the newly set standards for the detection and prevention of conflicts
of interests. Members noted with concern that the Authority applies a less stringent conflicts of interest policy to experts from food
safety organisations (FSOs), as the list which the Authority uses to indicate these FSOs includes institutes that are nominated by
Member States and cofinanced by private or undisclosed partners, creating a possible loophole. They considered that the Authority
should apply a two-year cooling-off period to all material interests related to the commercial agrifood sector , including research
funding, consultancy contracts and decision-making positions in industry-captured organisations. The Authority should ask experts to
declare whether their interests were remunerated or not. Current practice of experts anonymising their interests, for instance by using
the expression private company, should not be accepted by the Authority. They stated that the current declarations of interests forms
could be further improved.
Lastly, Members also made a series of observations on transfers, procurement and recruitment procedures as well as comments on internal
controls.

2013/2220(DEC) - 03/04/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a decision concerning the discharge to be granted to the Executive Director of the European Food Safety
Authority (EFSA) in respect of the implementation of the Authority's budget for the financial year 2012. The vote on the discharge decision
approved the closure of the accounts (in accordance with Annex VI, Article 5(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament.
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the Authority for the financial
year 2012 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Parliament adopted by 510 votes to 70, with 14 abstentions,
a resolution containing a series of recommendations that form an integral part of the discharge decision and as well as the general
recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies.
These recommendations are summarised as follows:
Reliability of the accounts: Parliament noted that the Court of Auditors found, in its annual audit report for 2012, that the validation of
the accounting systems by the Authoritys accounting officer covers the central ABAC and SAP systems, but not the local systems and
the reliability of data exchanges between central and local systems, which represents a risk as to the reliability of accounting data. It
acknowledged that the risk did not materialise in the use of inaccurate data by the Authority's accounting officer; expects the Authority,
however, to integrate its local systems in the validation process by its accounting officer.
Budget and financial management: Parliament noted that budget monitoring efforts during the financial year 2012 resulted in a budget
implementation rate of 99.30% and that the payment appropriations execution rate was 88%. It acknowledged that the relocation of
the Authority to its new premises generated savings amounting to EUR 3.94 million and that that amount was reallocated to
operational activities.
Commitments and carryovers: Parliament noted that carryovers were high. It acknowledged that a high amount of carry-overs were
made for reasons beyond the Authoritys control. They recalled that the Authority should respect the principle of annuality.
Prevention and management of conflicts of interests and transparency: Parliament believed that the procedure for assessing possible
conflicts of interest at the Authority, where declarations of interest are screened by Heads of Unit and are generally assessed on a
case by case basis, is burdensome and is subject to criticism, raising questions about its credibility and effectiveness. It called on the
Authority to come up with a simplified procedure with less uncertainty which would validate and streamline the process and save both
human resources and money without, however, jeopardising the newly set standards for the detection and prevention of conflicts of
interests. It also noted with concern that the Authority applies a less stringent conflicts of interest policy to experts from food safety
organisations (FSOs), as the list which the Authority uses to indicate these FSOs includes institutes that are nominated by Member
States and cofinanced by private or undisclosed partners, creating a possible loophole. Parliament considered that the Authority
should apply a two-year cooling-off period to all material interests related to the commercial agrifood sector , including research
funding, consultancy contracts and decision-making positions in industry-captured organisations. The Authority should ask experts to
declare whether their interests were remunerated or not. Current practice of experts anonymising their interests, for instance by using
the expression private company, should not be accepted by the Authority. It stated that the current declarations of interests forms
could be further improved. In addition, it believed that that list should be revised by excluding organisations which receive more than
50% of their funding from sources other than public sources, in order to avoid undue influence.
Performance: Parliament requested that the Authority communicate the results and impact its work has on European citizens in an
accessible way, mainly through its website.
Lastly, Parliament also made a series of observations on transfers, procurement and recruitment procedures as well as comments on internal
controls.
