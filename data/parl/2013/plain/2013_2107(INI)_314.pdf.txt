Commission response to text adopted in plenary

2013/2107(INI) - 26/09/2013 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Special committee on organised crime, corruption and money laundering adopted the final initiative report by Salvatore IACOLINO (EPP,
IT) on the same subject and proposed recommendations on action and initiatives to be taken.
Members reiterated the substance of its interim report, adopted by resolution of 11 June 2013, the importance of supporting a coherent
uniform regulatory framework on organised crime, corruption and money laundering. The Commission is called upon to launch a European
action plan against organised crime, corruption and money laundering, which should include legislative measures and positive action designed
to combat these criminal activities effectively.
Members urged all Member States to promptly and correctly transpose into their national legislation all existing EU and international legal
instruments concerning organised crime, corruption and money laundering.
Although endorsing the proposals in the 11 June 2013 resolution (please refer to the summary of the resolution), Members made a series of
new general and specific proposals which seek to combat organised crime, corruption and money laundering:
1. A coherent uniform regulatory framework: the Commission should propose and include a list of concrete recommendations for each Member
State and EU institution, highlighting best practice examples in combating corruption. The Commission should ensure the publication of the
next report in 2015 to track progress of the efforts in Member States and EU institutions to fight corruption over time.
2. Strengthen the legislative measure by proposing common judicial standards to strengthen integration and cooperation among Member
States. A legislative proposal should set out a common definition of organised crime, which should include, inter alia, the offence of
participation in a transnational criminal organisation. The Commission is called upon to submit, by the end of 2013, a proposal to harmonise
criminal law on money laundering, providing a common definition of the offence of self-laundering based on Member States best practices.
They insisted on the need for the full application, and the strengthening, of the existing mutual recognition instruments.
3. Seizure of assets: Members called for measures to enhance the current framework on this issue and promote the reuse of seized criminal
assets for social purposes such as redirecting these proceeds to victims and communities which have been devastated by drugs and
organised crime. The Commission is called upon to bring forward a legislative proposal aimed at effectively ensuring the mutual recognition of
seizure and confiscation orders linked to the asset protection measures adopted by the Italian judicial authorities and to the civil law measures
adopted in various EU countries. They called on the Member States to foster administrative, police and judicial cooperation enabling criminal
assets to be traced anywhere in EU territory with a view to their seizure or confiscation, including through full activation of the network of Asset
Recovery Offices.
4. Strengthen judicial and police cooperation at European and international level: Member States are called upon to create national bodies for
investigating and combating criminal and mafia-type organisations, with the possibility of developing with Europol coordination and support
from the Commission a streamline and informal anti-mafia operational network. Members considered that the globalisation of organised crime
requires stronger cooperation among Member States, at EU and international level. Therefore, they encouraged greater interaction between
the EU, the UN, the OECD and the Council of Europe in the fight against organised crime, corruption and money laundering. They also
strongly recommended the need to draw up, without further delay, a European action plan to combat cybercrime.
5. An efficient and corruption-resistant public administration: Members recommended that stronger systems be put in place to bring
transparency and integrity to, and eliminate red tape from, government departments and other public bodies, with this meaning that there must
be full access to information on every aspect of administrative organisation and activity. They encouraged the use of the resources available
for covert operations to enable official corruption to be uncovered more effectively.
6. More accountable politics: Members recommended that Member States provide, in their respective penalty systems, that those convicted by
final judgement of participation in organised crime, money laundering, corruption, or other serious offences, be deemed ineligible for inclusion
on the election lists. Such a penalty should be applied for a period of at least five years and that the same period of disqualification should
apply to government posts at every level. Moreover, they recommended that Member States should require people to forfeit political office or
management and administrative positions once they have been convicted of organised crime, corruption or money laundering offences.
As in the interim report, Members made ??a number of recommendations to ensure:
a more credible criminal justice: Members encouraged Member States to provide for both prison sentences and large fines for all
types of serious offences that harm citizens' health and security. They urged the Member States to provide for punishments offering an
alternative to imprisonment, such as fines or community service, in cases where this is permitted. For Members, penalties should be
proportionate to the sums involved.

more honest companies: in addition to measures of self-regulation and transparency, Members called for a public list of companies
which have been convicted of corrupt practices to be excluded from participating in European public procurement procedures;
more transparent banking system: Members called once again for a common definition of tax havens and especially the abolition of
bank secrecy.
To ensure that crime does not pay, Members called on the Commission to propose an appropriate legislative framework to combat money
laundering linked to gambling and betting, in particular sports betting and betting on animals used in blood sports. They regretted differences in
the legislation as regards euro counterfeiting.
Members recommended that a culture of prevention and cybersecurity be made more widespread, taking an integrated and multidisciplinary
approach with the aim of raising public awareness and promoting research and technical and specialist training, cooperation between the
public and private sectors and the exchange of information both nationally and internationally.
Final recommendations: Members make a series of final recommendations. The main elements may be summarised as follows:
this resolution should be implemented by means of a European action plan for the period 2014-2019 to eradicate organised crime,
corruption and money laundering, which shall provide a roadmap and adequate resources and, with due respect for the principles of
subsidiarity and proportionality;
a definition of organised crime (to include, inter alia, the crime of involvement in a mafia-type organisation), corruption and money
laundering (including self-laundering) should be based, inter alia, on a report on the implementation of the relevant European
legislation;
eliminate tax havens throughout the European Union and put an end to tax evasion and tax avoidance by adopting the origin of wealth
principle recommended by the OECD;
guarantee full access to information on the actual owners of companies, foundations and trusts ( beneficial ownership), also by
adapting and interconnecting Member States' business registries accordingly;
introduce the principle of the legal liability of legal entities in particular of holdings and parent companies for their subsidiaries in
cases of financial crime;
eradicate trafficking in human beings and forced labour, especially as regards minors and women, through tougher sanctions, and
make sure that the victims of trafficking are duly protected and supported;
make sports-rigging a criminal offence in order to strengthen the fight against illegal sports betting;
make vote buying a criminal offence, even where its benefits are intangible and accrue to third parties;
introduce Europe-wide corporate taxation that is as uniform, equal and homogeneous as possible;
strengthen the agreements on judicial and police cooperation between the Member States and between the EU and third countries;
strengthen the fight against environmental crimes and drug trafficking;
provide for economic players convicted by final judgement of organised crime, corruption or money laundering to be excluded from
public procurement procedures anywhere in the European Union;
establish and launch the European Public Prosecutors Office;
recognise the relevant role of investigative journalism in identifying serious crimes;
introduce standard pan-European rules on the protection of witnesses, informers and those who cooperate with the courts;
etc.

2013/2107(INI) - 23/10/2013 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 526 votes to 25, with 87 abstentions, a resolution on organised crime, corruption and money laundering.
Parliament reiterated the substance of its interim report, adopted by resolution of 11 June 2013, the importance of supporting a coherent
uniform regulatory framework on organised crime, corruption and money laundering. The Commission is called upon to launch a European
action plan against organised crime, corruption and money laundering, which should include legislative measures and positive action designed
to combat these criminal activities effectively.
Members urged all Member States to promptly and correctly transpose into their national legislation all existing EU and international legal
instruments concerning organised crime, corruption and money laundering.
Parliament reiterated its call to the Commission to propose common judicial standards to strengthen integration and cooperation among
Member States and to submit, by the end of 2013, a legislative proposal setting out a common definition of organised crime, which should
include, inter alia, the offence of participation in a transnational criminal organisation. It also called on the Commission to criminalise the abuse
and exploitation of the victims of human being trafficking.
Although endorsing the proposals in the 11 June 2013 resolution (please refer to the summary of the resolution), Parliament made a series of
new general and specific proposals which seek to combat organised crime, corruption and money laundering:
1. A coherent uniform regulatory framework: the Commission should propose and include a list of concrete recommendations for each Member
State and EU institution, highlighting best practice examples in combating corruption. The Commission should ensure the publication of the
next report in 2015 to track progress of the efforts in Member States and EU institutions to fight corruption over time.
2. Strengthen the legislative measure by proposing common judicial standards and on the need for the full application, and the strengthening,
of the existing mutual recognition instruments.
3. Seizure of assets: Parliament called for measures to enhance the current framework on this issue and promote the reuse of seized criminal
assets for social purposes. The Commission is called upon to bring forward a legislative proposal aimed at effectively ensuring the mutual
recognition of seizure and confiscation orders to introduce models of non-conviction based confiscation. In this regard, plenary invited Member
States and the Commission to promote international cooperation and support a European programme to encourage the exchange and
dissemination of good practices for the efficient management of confiscated assets. It also called for administrative, police and judicial
cooperation enabling criminal assets to be traced anywhere in EU territory with a view to their seizure or confiscation, including through full
activation of the network of asset recovery offices. Parliament called for the promotion of a zero vision against sexual and labour exploitation.
4. Strengthen judicial and police cooperation at European and international level: Member States are called upon to create national bodies for

investigating and combating criminal and mafia-type organisations, with the possibility of developing with Europol coordination and support
from the Commission a streamline and informal anti-mafia operational network. Members considered that the globalisation of organised crime
requires stronger cooperation among Member States, at EU and international level. Therefore, they encouraged greater interaction between
the EU, the UN, the OECD and the Council of Europe in this area. A European action plan to combat cybercrime was also supported. Plenary
suggested the creation of centralised registers for current bank accounts.
5. Fight against terrorism: Parliament took note of the existing links between organised crime and terrorism, as highlighted by the judicial
authorities and the police in some circumstances in connection with the financing of the illegal activities of terrorist groups via the proceeds of
illicit trafficking at international level and called on the Member States to strengthen their measures to combat such activities. It encouraged the
joint training of anti-crime and anti-terrorism experts.
6. Corruption-resistant public administration: Parliament recommended that stronger systems be put in place to bring transparency and
integrity to, and eliminate red tape from, government departments and other public bodies, with this meaning that there must be full access to
information on every aspect of administrative organisation and activity. It encouraged the use of the resources available for covert operations
to enable official corruption to be uncovered more effectively. Public procurement procedures must be based on the principle of legality and
that, in this regard, the criterion of the economically most advantageous tender should be pursued while ensuring full transparency in the
selection procedure.
Plenary also called on the Commission to submit a proposal for a directive by the end of 2014 on common investigative techniques to combat
organised crime, pursuant to Article 87(2)(c) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.
7. More accountable politics: Parliament recommended that Member States provide, in their respective penalty systems, that those convicted
by final judgement of participation in organised crime, money laundering, corruption, or other serious offences, be deemed ineligible for
inclusion on the election lists. Such a penalty should be applied for a period of at least five years and that the same period of disqualification
should apply to government posts at every level. Moreover, they recommended that Member States should require people to forfeit political
office or management and administrative positions once they have been convicted.
Parliament proposed that all innocent victims of organised crime, especially mafia-type crime, be commemorated, and that special tribute be
paid to those who have died fighting organised criminal groups, by establishing a European Day of Memory and Commitment in
Remembrance of the Innocent Victims of Organised Crime to be held each year, starting from 2014.
It made ??a number of recommendations to ensure:
a more credible criminal justice: Parliament encouraged Member States to provide for both prison sentences and large fines for all
types of serious offences that harm citizens' health and security. It urged the Member States to provide for punishments offering an
alternative to imprisonment, such as fines or community service, in cases where this is permitted. For Members, penalties should be
proportionate to the sums involved;
more honest companies: in addition to measures of self-regulation and transparency, Members called for a public list of companies
which have been convicted of corrupt practices to be excluded from participating in European public procurement procedures;
more transparent banking system: Members called once again for a common definition of tax havens and especially the abolition of
bank secrecy. The EU and the Member States are called upon to urgently and definitively address this issue internally, as well as
externally by raising it with third states and territories, notably those in Europe or with which Member States have very numerous or
suspicious financial transactions. Plenary called on Member States to introduce a requirement for country-by-country reporting on
profit and taxes for all multinational companies, with a view to ending aggressive tax planning.
To ensure that crime does not pay, Parliament called on the Commission to propose an appropriate legislative framework to combat money
laundering linked to gambling and betting, in particular sports betting and betting on animals used in blood sports. They regretted differences in
the legislation as regards euro counterfeiting and called for a traceability system for euro banknotes to be put in place and for the eurozone
countries to stop printing bank notes in denominations of more than EUR 100.
Parliament recommended that a culture of prevention and cybersecurity be made more widespread, taking an integrated and multidisciplinary
approach with the aim of raising public awareness and promoting research and technical and specialist training, cooperation between the
public and private sectors and the exchange of information both nationally and internationally.
