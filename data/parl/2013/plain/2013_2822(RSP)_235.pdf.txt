Summary

The European Parliament adopted a resolution expressing its strong concern about the recent escalation of violence in the eastern Democratic
Republic of Congo, with the resumption of hostilities between the M23 and government troops.
The resolution was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ECR, Greens/EFA, GUE/NGL and ALDE groups. It condemns especially the indiscriminate
shelling by the armed M23 group, and other armed groups, in particular the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), and
demands an immediate end to all human rights abuses including the alarming and widespread sexual and gender-based violence (as referred
to in UN Security Council resolution 1820 (2008) of 19 June 2008), and the unfortunate recruitment of children by armed forces. Furthermore,
Parliament strongly condemns all forms of external support to the M23 group and other disruptive forces in the DRC and demands the
immediate and permanent cessation of such support. Any direct intervention by the DRC's neighbouring countries can only exacerbate the
situation, and Parliament calls on all regional actors concerned to exercise the utmost restraint and to refrain from any acts or statements that
could lead to a further deterioration of the situation. It calls for a thorough investigation by the Expanded Joint Verification Mechanism (EJVM)
into the sources of the mortar shells and bombs from DRC territory landing in neighbouring Rwanda.
Members welcome the mobilisation of an additional EUR 10 million by the Commission to deliver urgently needed relief to 2.5 million people in
the DRC, which brings EU emergency aid to the DRC and the Great Lakes region to EUR 71 million in 2013, making the EU the country's
largest humanitarian donor.
They go on to praise the active steps taken by UN mission in the DRC (MONUSCO) to implement its mandate, in particular the protection of
civilians, and urge the UN Security Council to take all necessary action in line with Security Council resolution 2098 (2013) to protect civilians
in the eastern DRC.
Parliament stresses the role of the Great Lakes countries, particularly following the commitments made in February 2013 in the framework of
the Addis Ababa agreements, to engage in promoting peace, and calls on them, as well as the African Union, to take further steps to fight the
illicit exploitation of natural resources and trade therein, this being one of the reasons for the proliferation and trafficking of arms, which in turn
is one of the major factors fuelling conflicts in the Great Lakes region. The EU and the whole of the international community must step up
cooperation with the DRC in this field.
Parliament wants to see the continuation of the EU military assistance mission (EUSEC) and the EU's police assistance mission (EUPOL), in
order to consolidate peace and security both in the country and in the Great Lakes region. It recommends that during its 24th session the
United Nations Human Rights Council adopt a strong resolution re-establishing some form of monitoring mechanism concerning the human
rights situation in the DRC, and asking the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to submit a report on the situation.
