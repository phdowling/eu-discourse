Summary

2013/2983(RSP) - 12/12/2013 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a resolution on the outcome of the Vilnius Summit and the future of the Eastern Partnership, in particular as
regards Ukraine.
The resolution was tabled by the EPP, S&D, ALDE, Greens/EFA, ECR, and EFD groups.
It welcomed the initialling of Association Agreements, including DCFTAs, with Georgia and Moldova, but deplored the decision by the
Ukrainian authorities, under the lead of President Yanukovych, to withdraw from signing the Association Agreement with the EU . This was a
major missed opportunity in EU-Ukraine relations and for Ukraines aspirations, as evidenced in the ongoing demonstrations by Ukrainian civil
society in the Euromaidan in Kyiv and in other cities all over Ukraine. In this context, Parliament deplored the brutal and unacceptable use of
force by Ukrainian security forces made against peaceful demonstrators, opposition parties and the media, and the violent events of the night
of 9 to 10 December 2013, and expressed its full solidarity with those demonstrating for a European future. Members called for the immediate
and unconditional release of the peaceful protesters arrested in the last few days.
Parliament reaffirmed its strong support for the signing of the Association Agreement as soon as possible, provided that the relevant
requirements were met, and called on the European Council, at its December 2013 meeting, to send a strong political signal that the EU
remained ready to engage with Ukraine. It wanted to see the immediate launch of a new, fully fledged EU mediation mission at the highest
political level, to assist in roundtable talks between the government and the democratic opposition and civil society and to secure a peaceful
outcome to the current crisis.
Reiterating its firm condemnation of the unacceptable political and economic pressure, coupled with threats of trade sanctions, being exerted
by Russia on Ukraine, Parliament called on the Commission to consider possible counter-measures which the EU could evoke when Russia
broke World Trade Organisation (WTO) trade rules for short-sighted political ends.
It urged the EU to:
·

implement a policy of adequate response to these tools and measures used by Russia against Eastern partners, especially with a
view to helping Ukraine acquire energy security, in the light of the ongoing crisis regarding the importing of natural gas from Russia.
Further efforts should be made to include Ukraine fully in the EUs internal energy market;

·

commit to a broad opening towards Ukrainian society, in particular through a swift agreement on a visa-free regime, strengthened
research cooperation, expanded youth exchanges and increased availability of scholarships;

·

support the involvement of international financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, with a view to providing financial assistance to help Ukraine tackle its worsening financial
situation.

Armenia: Parliament regretted the fact that after more than three years of successfully completed negotiations on an Association Agreement,
the Armenian authorities decided instead to join the Customs Union, following Russian pressure. The Armenian authorities are reminded that
the protests and demonstrations against this decision are an expression of the free will of the countrys citizens and they must engage in an
inclusive dialogue with civil society on the countrys future direction.
Azerbaijan: Parliament welcomed the signing of the visa facilitation agreement between the EU and Azerbaijan. It expressed concern about
the crackdown on dissent that has taken place in the country following the presidential elections of October 2013. It also urged the Azerbaijani
parliament to reconsider its decision to suspend its participation in the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly, following the adoption of Parliaments
resolution of 23 October 2013.
Moldova and Georgia: Members welcomed the proposal to allow visa-free travel to the Schengen area for Moldovan citizens holding a
biometric passport, and also welcomed the signing of a framework agreement with Georgia on participation in EU crisis management
operations.
In conclusion, Parliament felt that the outcome and overall context of the Vilnius Summit highlighted the need for the EU to articulate a more
strategic and flexible policy in support of the European choice of its Eastern partners , using the full range of tools at its disposal, such as
macroeconomic assistance, easing of trade regimes, projects to enhance energy security and economic modernisation, and swift
implementation of visa liberalisation, in line with European values and interests. It called for a European Parliament mission to be sent to
Ukraine as soon as possible; welcomes the involvement of the Conference of Local and Regional Authorities of the Eastern Partnership.
