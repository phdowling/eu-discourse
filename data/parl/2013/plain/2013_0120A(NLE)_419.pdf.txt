OJ L 125 26.04.2014, p. 0044 Summary

2013/0120A(NLE) - 01/10/2013 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE : to conclude a Framework Agreement on Comprehensive Partnership and Cooperation between the European Community and its
Member States, of the one part, and
Indonesia, of the other part.
PROPOSED ACT : Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT : the Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND : in November 2004, the Council authorised the Commission to negotiate a Framework Agreement on Partnership and
Cooperation (PCA) with Indonesia. In accordance with the Council Decision of 5 November 2009, the Framework Agreement was signed on 9
November 2009, subject to its conclusion at a later date. It would be the first of its kind between the EU and an ASEAN country.
The PCA should now be approved on behalf of the Union.
IMPACT ASSESSMENT : no impact assessment was undertaken.
LEGAL BASIS : Articles 91, 100, 191(4), 207 and 209, in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European
Union (TFEU).
CONTENT : the draft decision proposes that the Council conclude a Framework Agreement on Comprehensive Partnership and Cooperation
between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and Indonesia, of the other part.
General principles: the Agreement aims to strengthen relations between the EU and Indonesia, and opens a new era in bilateral relations,
based on shared principles such as equality, mutual respect, mutual benefit, democracy, rule of law and human rights. These principles
underpin the internal and international policies of both Parties and constitutes an essential element of the Agreement.
General principles underlying the Agreement include:
·

the fight against climate change and reaching the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) ;

·

good governance and the independence of the judiciary, as well as the fight against corruption ;

·

equality and mutual benefit ;

Cooperation: the Agreement strengthens political, economic and sectoral cooperation across a wide range of policy fields:
·

trade,

·

environment,

·

energy,

·

science and technology,

·

good governance,

·

tourism and culture,

·

migration,

·

counter terrorism and the fight against corruption and organised crime.

It will further enhance cooperation on responding to global challenges, such as questions discussed in the G20.
Also covered are other sectors of common interest: financial services; taxation and customs; macro-economic policy; industrial policy and
SMEs; information society; science and technology; energy; transport and transport safety; education and culture; human rights; environment
and natural resources, including marine environment; forestry; agriculture and rural development; cooperation on marine and fisheries; health;
food safety; animal health; statistics; personal data protection; cooperation on the modernisation of the state and public administration; and
intellectual property rights; migration issues, including legal and illegal migration, and trafficking in human beings.
Cooperation covers, furthermore, countering the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; civil society and strengthening NGOs.
The Agreement includes a clause permitting its extension to new areas of cooperation.
Political dialogue: the PCA will be regarded as a positive example for an inter-cultural/religious dialogue, given that Indonesia is the third most
populous country in Asia and the largest Muslim country in the world.
Institutional framework: the Agreement will also include institutional provisions designed to establish a Joint Committee, composed of
representatives of both sides at the highest possible level in order to ensure the proper functioning and implementation of this Agreement and
resolve differences.
Duration of the Agreement: the Agreement is valid for a period of five years and will be automatically extended for further successive periods
of one year, unless either Party puts forward a written objection.
N.B. : certain provisions of the Agreement concern the readmission of persons illegally resident and therefore fall within the scope of Title V of

Part Three of the Treaty. A separate decision relating to those provisions is to be adopted in parallel to this Decision.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS : the proposal has no implications for the EU budget.

2013/0120A(NLE) - 10/02/2014 Committee interim report tabled for plenary
The Committee on Foreign Affairs adopted the interim report by Ana GOMES (S&D, PT) the draft Council decision on the conclusion of the
Framework Agreement on Comprehensive Partnership and cooperation between the European Community and its Member States, of the one
part, and the Republic of Indonesia, of the other part, with the exception of matters related to readmission.
Members recalled that Indonesia is the worlds fourth most populous nation, the third largest democracy and the largest Muslim majority
country.
Taking account these elements, Members called on the Council to take account of the following recommendations in the framework of this
interim report and before final consent of the Agreement:
the recommendation stressed that the PCA aims to further strengthen relations between the EU and Indonesia, in addition to the
existing cooperation mechanisms, and to cooperate in addressing global challenges, based on the shared principles of equality,
mutual respect, mutual benefit, democracy, active civil society participation, the rule of law, good governance and human rights, by
developing political and economic cooperation in all matters;
Members believed that the relationship between Indonesia and the EU ought to be recognised as strategic and that regular summits
should be held to review bilateral and global developments;
Members urged the EU and Indonesia to make full use of the PCA in order to achieve long-term geostrategic benefits in facing global
security challenges, such as tackling climate change and the proliferation of WMD, piracy;
the recommendation stressed the need to combat corruption.
Human rights: Members stressed the inconsistency of Law 8/1985 and the new Law on Mass Organisations 17/2013 (repealing the former
Law on Associations 8/1985) on civil organisations (the Ormas Bill), which, despite the stated purpose of ensuring tolerance and preventing
violence against society groups, if not revised to conform with international human rights standards, risks imposing unnecessary and
sometimes onerous administrative, legal and financial restrictions on the activities of nongovernmental organisations.
Members called on both national and foreign enterprises operating in Indonesia need to develop their activities in accordance with the
principles of corporate social responsibility.
Freedom of culture: Members noted with regret that the increasingly strong focus on Islamic teachings in the public education system, to the
detriment of the stress on religious, ethnic and cultural plurality and diversity enshrined in the Indonesian motto Bhineka Tunggal Ika (Unity in
Diversity), and expressed their concern as regards acts of violence towards religious minorities and the closure of churches in some parts of
the country.
Death penalty: Members recalled that the abolition of the death penalty is a key objective of the Union's human rights policy and called on the
Indonesian authorities to consider abolishing the death penalty, or at least declaring a moratorium on its application. They also called for the
end of acts of violence against the civilian population in Papua and West Papua.
Members called for further efforts to:
eradicate genital mutilation,
eliminate the worst forms of child labour, and its legal framework to tackle child exploitation;
diversify energy supplies by developing new and renewable forms of energy,
apply the moratorium on the clearing of new forest decided by the Government in 2011,
develop sustainable tourism models,
starting negotiations on visa facilitation with a view to increasing people-to-people exchanges,
modernise the public administration,
reduce plantations of palm oil and rubber,
improve efficiency in asset recovery and fighting terrorism, piracy, organised crime, money laundering and tax havens.

2013/0120A(NLE) - 20/02/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Foreign Affairs adopted the report by Ana GOMES (S&D, PT) on the draft Council decision on the conclusion of the
Framework Agreement on Comprehensive Partnership and cooperation between the European Community and its Member States, of the one
part, and the Republic of Indonesia, of the other part, with the exception of matters related to readmission.
The committee recommended the European Parliament to give its consent to the conclusion of the Agreement.

2013/0120A(NLE) - 26/02/2014 Interim resolution adopted by Parliament
The European Parliament adopted an interim report on the draft Council decision on the conclusion of the Framework Agreement on
Comprehensive Partnership and cooperation between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of
Indonesia, of the other part, with the exception of matters related to readmission.
Parliament recalled that Indonesia is the worlds fourth most populous nation, the third largest democracy and the largest Muslim majority
country.
Taking account of these elements, it called on the Council to take account of the following recommendations in the framework of the consent

of the Agreement:
the recommendation stressed that the PCA aims to further strengthen relations between the EU and Indonesia, in addition to the
existing cooperation mechanisms, and to cooperate in addressing global challenges, based on the shared principles of equality,
mutual respect, mutual benefit, democracy, active civil society participation, the rule of law, good governance and human rights, by
developing political and economic cooperation in all matters;
Parliament believed that the relationship between Indonesia and the EU ought to be recognised as strategic and that regular summits
should be held to review bilateral and global developments;
Parliament urged the EU and Indonesia to make full use of the PCA in order to achieve long-term geostrategic benefits in facing global
security challenges, such as tackling climate change and the proliferation of WMD, piracy;
Parliament stressed the need to combat corruption.
Economic expansion: Parliament highlighted that Indonesia's 15-year process of democratic, political, social and economic transformation,
after 33 years of authoritarian military rule and that Indonesia is urbanising rapidly. It has a fast-rising middle class (of over 70 million), ample
natural resources, the largest economy in Southeast Asia (GDP growing by more than 6% in the last two years), with half of the world's trade
passing its northern maritime border, and an increasing diplomatic presence in regional and global fora, such as the UN, the WTO, the IOC
and the G20, as well as the ASEAN, of which Indonesia is both a founder and its largest member, and recognises the important role played by
Indonesia in the broader region. In this respect, Parliament recognised the important role of Indonesia in the region as a whole.
Human rights: Parliament stressed the inconsistency of Law 8/1985 and the new Law on Mass Organisations 17/2013 (repealing the former
Law on Associations 8/1985) on civil organisations (the Ormas Bill), which, despite the stated purpose of ensuring tolerance and preventing
violence against society groups, if not revised to conform with international human rights standards, risks imposing unnecessary and
sometimes onerous administrative, legal and financial restrictions on the activities of non-governmental organisations.
It called on both national and foreign enterprises operating in Indonesia need to develop their activities in accordance with the principles of
corporate social responsibility.
Freedom of culture: Parliament noted with regret that the increasingly strong focus on Islamic teachings in the public education system, to the
detriment of the stress on religious, ethnic and cultural plurality and diversity enshrined in the Indonesian motto Bhineka Tunggal Ika (Unity in
Diversity), and expressed their concern as regards acts of violence towards religious minorities and the closure of churches in some parts of
the country.
Death penalty: Parliament recalled that the abolition of the death penalty is a key objective of the Union's human rights policy and called on the
Indonesian authorities to consider abolishing the death penalty, or at least declaring a moratorium on its application. They also called for the
end of acts of violence against the civilian population in Papua and West Papua.
Parliament also called for further efforts to:
