2013/0420(NLE) - 06/12/2013 Initial legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude a Protocol to the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Communities and their Member
States, of the one part, and Azerbaijan, of the other part, on a Framework Agreement between the European Union and Azerbaijan on the
general principles for the participation of Azerbaijan in Union programmes.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: as part of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), the gradual opening-up of certain Union programmes and agencies to
the participation of ENP partner countries represents one of many measures to promote reform, modernisation and transition in the European
Union's neighbourhood. The Commission outlined this policy aspect more extensively in its Communication "on the general approach to
enable European Neighbourhood Policy partner countries to participate in Community agencies and Community programmes". The Council
endorsed this approach in conclusions on 5 March 2007.
Based upon this Communication and those conclusions, the Council, on 18 June 2007, issued directives to the Commission to negotiate
Framework Agreements with Algeria, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Egypt, Georgia, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Moldova, Morocco, the Palestinian
Authority, Tunisia and Ukraine, on the general principles for their participation in Community programmes. To date, a number of Protocols
have already been signed with a number of these countries.
In October 2012, Azerbaijan expressed its interest to participate in the broad range of programmes open to partner countries of the European
Neighbourhood Policy.
The text of the Protocol negotiated with Azerbaijan is attached and is the subject of this proposal.
The Protocol should now be approved on behalf of the Union.
CONTENT: the Commission herewith submits a proposal for a Council Decision on the conclusion of the Protocol.
This Protocol contains a Framework Agreement on the general principles for the participation of Azerbaijan in Union programmes. It contains
standard stipulations that are intended to be applied to all European Neighbourhood Policy partner countries with which such protocols are to
be concluded.
The Protocol determines in particular the specific terms and conditions, in particular, the financial contribution and reporting and evaluation
procedures, regarding the participation of Azerbaijan in each particular programme in an agreement between the European Commission and
the competent authorities of Azerbaijan.
The negotiated text also foresees that the Parties shall provisionally apply the provisions of this Protocol from the date of its signature.
According to Article 218(6)(a) of the TFEU, the European Parliament shall be requested to give its consent to the conclusion of this Protocol.
In parallel, the Commission submits a proposal for a Council Decision on the signature and provisional application of the said Protocol.

2013/0420(NLE) - 07/02/2014 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude a Protocol to the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Communities and their Member
States, of the one part, and the Republic of Azerbaijan, of the other part, on a Framework Agreement between the European Union and the
Republic of Azerbaijan on the general principles for the participation of the Republic of Azerbaijan in Union programmes.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent.
CONTEXT: the Protocol to the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the
one part, and the Republic of Azerbaijan, of the other part, on a Framework Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of
Azerbaijan on the general principles for the participation of the Republic of Azerbaijan in Union programmes was signed on behalf of the
Union.
The Protocol should therefore be approved in the name of the European Union.
CONTENT: with this Decision proposal, the Council is invited to approve in the name of the European Union, the Protocol to the Partnership
and Cooperation Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Azerbaijan, of
the other part, on a Framework Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Azerbaijan on the general principles for the
participation of the Republic of Azerbaijan in Union programmes.
For the material content of the Protocol, see the summary of the Commissions initial legislative proposal dated 06/12/2013.

2013/0420(NLE) - 16/06/2016 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Foreign Affairs adopted the report by Norica NICOLAI (ADLR, RO) on the draft Council decision on the conclusion of a
Protocol to the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and
the Republic of Azerbaijan, of the other part, on a Framework Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Azerbaijan on the
general principles for the participation of the Republic of Azerbaijan in Union programmes.
The committee recommended the European Parliament to give its consent to the conclusion of the Protocol.

To recall, the aim of the Protocol is to lay down financial and technical rules enabling Azerbaijan to participate in certain European Union
Programmes open to third countries.
Furthermore, Azerbaijan is an important energy partner for the EU. However, the importance of EU-Azerbaijan relations is not limited to energy
security, and the relevance of this partnership should be considered in the context of all aspects of cooperation envisaged in the framework of
Eastern Partnership. Rule of law, human rights and democracy remain core principles on which relations of the EU with third countries should
be based on. In this context, the framework agreement under consideration aims to promote cooperation in sectors and foster
people-to-people contacts which should be beneficial for the society.

2013/0420(NLE) - 06/07/2016 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 577 votes to 67, with 51 votes, a legislative resolution on the draft Council decision on the conclusion of
a Protocol to the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and
the Republic of Azerbaijan, of the other part, on a Framework Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Azerbaijan on the
general principles for the participation of the Republic of Azerbaijan in Union programmes.
In line with the recommendation made by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the European Parliament gave its consent to the conclusion of the
Protocol.
To recall, the aim of the Protocol is to lay down financial and technical rules enabling Azerbaijan to participate in certain European Union
Programmes open to third countries. The Protocol determines in particular the specific terms and conditions, in particular, the financial
contribution and reporting and evaluation procedures, regarding the participation of Azerbaijan in each particular programme in an agreement
between the European Commission and the competent authorities of Azerbaijan.

2013/0420(NLE) - 18/07/2016 Final act
PURPOSE: to conclude a Protocol to the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Communities and their Member
States, of the one part, and Azerbaijan, of the other part, on a Framework Agreement between the European Union and Azerbaijan on the
general principles for the participation of this country Azerbaijan in Union programmes.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Council Decision (EU) 2016/1210 on the conclusion of a Protocol to the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement
between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Azerbaijan, of the other part, on a Framework Agreement
between the European Union and Azerbaijan on the general principles for the participation of this country in Union programmes.
CONTENT: under this Decision, the Protocol to the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Communities and their
Member States, of the one part, and Azerbaijan, of the other part, on a Framework Agreement between the European Union and Azerbaijan
on the general principles for the participation of this country in Union programmes is hereby approved on behalf of the Union.
The objective of the Protocol is to lay down the financial and technical rules enabling Azerbaijan to participate in certain Union programmes.
The horizontal framework established by the Protocol constitutes an economic, financial and technical cooperation measure which allows for
access to assistance, in particular financial assistance, to be provided by the Union pursuant to those Union programmes. That framework
applies only to those Union programmes for which the relevant constitutive legal acts provide for the possibility of the participation of the
Republic of Azerbaijan. The conclusion of the Protocol therefore does not entail the exercise of powers under the various sectoral policies
pursued by the programmes, which are exercised when establishing the programmes.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 18.7.2016.
