2013/2249(DEC) - 26/07/2013 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: presentation by the Commission of the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2012, as part of
the 2012 discharge procedure.
Analysis of the accounts of the Clean Sky Joint Undertaking.
CONTENT: this Commission document sets out the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2012 as
prepared on the basis of the information presented by the institutions, organisations and bodies of the EU, in accordance with Article 129 (2) of
the Financial Regulation applicable to the EU's General Budget, including the Clean Sky Joint Undertaking.
In 2012, the tasks and budget of the Joint Undertaking were as follows:
description of the tasks of the Joint Undertaking: the Clean Sky Joint Undertaking, which is located in Brussels, was established in
2007 by Regulation (EC) No 71/2008 for the period up to 31 December 2017. The aim of this entity is to accelerate the development,
validation and demonstration of clean air transport technologies in the EU and in particular to create a radically innovative Air
Transport System with the target of reducing the environmental impact of air transport.
budget of the Joint Undertaking for the 2012 financial year: the maximum indicative contribution of the Commission amounts to EUR
800 million, paid out under the 7th Research Framework Programme for research and technological development until 2017. The
cumulative unrecognised share of losses is EUR 48 million (62.89% ownership participation).
Please also consult Clean Sky Joint Undertakings final accounts.

2013/2249(DEC) - 22/10/2013 Court of Auditors: opinion, report
PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the Clean Sky Joint Undertaking for the financial year
2012, together with the Joint Undertakings reply.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.

This audit concerned, amongst others, the annual accounts of the Clean Sky Joint Undertaking.
In the Courts opinion, the Clean Sky Joint Undertakings Annual Accounts fairly present, in all material respects, its financial position as of 31
December 2012 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions of its financial
rules and the accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
It considers that the transactions underlying the annual accounts of the Centre for the financial year ended 31 December 2012 are, in all
material respects, legal and regular.
The report confirms that the resources available to the Joint Undertaking in 2012 amount to EUR 205 364 690 in commitment appropriations.
The report also makes a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of the Joint Undertaking, accompanied by the
latters response. The main observations may be summarised as follows:
Courts comments:
implementation of the budget: the utilisation rate for commitment appropriations was 84%, while the rate for payment appropriations
was 75%. The lower rate for payment appropriations reflects delays in the implementation of the budget, mainly as a result of delays in
the implementation of activities and in the period between the publication of calls for proposals and the signing of grant agreements;
audit procedures: during 2012 the Joint Undertaking further improved its management, administrative, financial and accounting
procedures. One of the main achievements in 2012 was the implementation of the GMT tool, a specific application for managing
financial information relating to the implementation of grant agreements with members. However, the GMT tool still presents some
limitations as regards the completeness of the operational information managed. The Court notes that a certain number of
weaknesses were noted in respect of the ex ante control of cost claims submitted by Clean Sky partners.
Joint Undertakings replies:
implementation of the budget: the JU points out that for the larger part of its operational expenditure, the actual implementation rate for
commitment appropriations was 97% while the rate for PA was 84%. It acknowledges that for the expenditure relating to calls for
proposals, further improvements need to be implemented to enable the JU to close more reports on time and execute higher payment
appropriations overall. Overall the JU has experienced a descending trend in the last calls, by permanently seeking to improve its
workflow and processes for the purpose of decreasing the time to grant;
on internal audits, the JU's management has agreed actions to mitigate the observations issued by the auditors.
As regards the activities of the Joint Undertaking in 2012, the report refers to the Annual Activity Report 2012 which can be found at

2013/2249(DEC) - 20/03/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Petri SARVAMAA (EPP, FI) in which it recommended the European Parliament to
grant discharge to the Executive Director of the Clean Sky Joint Undertaking in respect of the implementation of the Joint Undertaking's budget
for the financial year 2012.
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the Undertaking for the
financial year 2012 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Members approved the closure of the Undertakings
accounts. They made, however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is granted, in
addition to the general recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU
agencies.
Budgetary and Financial Management: Members noted that the Joint Undertaking's final amended budget for the financial year 2012
included commitment appropriations of EUR 205.4 million and payment appropriations of EUR 167.9 million. They are concerned with
the recurring low implementation of the budget of the Joint Undertaking and regretted the EUR 25.7 million cash balance at the end of
the year, representing 15% of the available payment appropriations. For Members, this is at odds with the budgetary principle of
equilibrium. They reminded the Joint Undertaking of the need to implement concrete measures to attain budget equilibrium.
Utilisation rate and carryovers: Members observed that while the utilisation rate for commitment appropriations was 84% overall, the
rate for payment appropriations was 75%. They noted, moreover, that within this, the operational implementation rate was 97% for
commitment appropriations and 84% for payment appropriations. They remained concerned that these rates reflect the significant
delays in the implementation of the activities as compared with the initial plan and called on the Joint Undertaking to continue to
improve its workflows and processes to shorten the period between the publication of calls for proposals and the signing of grant
agreements.
Members also made a series of observations on transfers, procurement and recruitment procedures as well as comments on internal controls.
They invited the Court of Auditors to monitor the Joint Undertaking's policies as regards the management and prevention of conflicts of
interests by drafting a Special Report on the matter by the next discharge procedure.
JTI: Members invited the Court of Auditors to comprehensively analyse the JTIs and the other joint undertakings in a separate report in light of
the substantial amounts involved and the risks notably reputational presented. Members noted that the Joint Undertakings total 2012
forecasted budgeted income amounted to some EUR 2.5 billion or about 1.8% of the Union general budget for the financial year 2012, while
approximately EUR 618 million came from the general budget (cash contribution from the European Commission) and approximately EUR 134
million came from the industrial partners and members of the Joint Undertakings. They recalled that Parliament has previously requested that
the Court of Auditors draw up a special report on the capacity of the joint undertakings, together with their private partners, to ensure added
value and efficient execution of Union research, technological development and demonstration programmes. Members agreed with the Court
of Auditors conclusion that the JTIs have been set up to support long-term industrial investment, in particular research areas but noted that it
has taken on average two years to grant financial autonomy to a JTI, with the Commission usually remaining responsible for one third of the
expected operational lifetime of the JTIs.

2013/2249(DEC) - 03/04/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a decision concerning the discharge to be granted to the Executive Director of the Clean Sky Joint
Undertaking in respect of the implementation of the Joint Undertaking's budget for the financial year 2012.The vote on the discharge decision
covered the closure of the accounts (in accordance with Annex VI, Article 5(1) of Parliaments Rules of Procedure).
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that the 2012 annual accounts of the Joint Undertaking present fairly, in all material respects, its
financial position as of 31 December 2012 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, Parliament adopted by
476 votes to 72, with 16 abstentions, a resolution containing a series of recommendations that need to be taken into account when the
discharge is granted, in addition to the general recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management
and control of EU agencies.
Budgetary and Financial Management: Parliament noted that the Joint Undertaking's final amended budget for the financial year 2012
included commitment appropriations of EUR 205.4 million and payment appropriations of EUR 167.9 million. It was concerned with the
recurring low implementation of the budget of the Joint Undertaking and regretted the EUR 25.7 million cash balance at the end of the
year, representing 15% of the available payment appropriations. For the Parliament, this is at odds with the budgetary principle of
equilibrium. It reminded the Joint Undertaking of the need to implement concrete measures to attain budget equilibrium.
Utilisation rate and carryovers: Parliament observed that while the utilisation rate for commitment appropriations was 84% overall, the
rate for payment appropriations was 75%. It noted, moreover, that within this, the operational implementation rate was 97% for
commitment appropriations and 84% for payment appropriations. It remained concerned that these rates reflect the significant delays
in the implementation of the activities as compared with the initial plan and called on the Joint Undertaking to continue to improve its
workflows and processes to shorten the period between the publication of calls for proposals and the signing of grant agreements.
Audit: Parliament was concerned that while the audit certificates accompanying the cost claims of two beneficiaries were found to
include reservations about the contracts of the staff employed on the project and in one of them, the audit certificate also included
reservations on the indirect cost rates applied, the Joint Undertaking released the payments, underlining that these payments were not
irregular.
Parliament also made a series of observations on transfers, procurement and recruitment procedures as well as comments on internal
controls.
It invited the Court of Auditors to monitor the Joint Undertaking's policies as regards the management and prevention of conflicts of interests
by drafting a Special Report on the matter by the next discharge procedure.
JTI: Parliament invited the Court of Auditors to comprehensively analyse the JTIs and the other joint undertakings in a separate report in light
of the substantial amounts involved and the risks notably reputational presented. Parliament noted that the Joint Undertakings total 2012
forecasted budgeted income amounted to some EUR 2.5 billion or about 1.8% of the Union general budget for the financial year 2012, while
approximately EUR 618 million came from the general budget (cash contribution from the European Commission) and approximately EUR 134
million came from the industrial partners and members of the Joint Undertakings. It recalled that the total Union contribution deemed
necessary for the Joint Undertakings for their period of existence amounts to EUR 11.5 billion.
It recalled that Parliament has previously requested that the Court of Auditors draw up a special report on the capacity of the joint
undertakings, together with their private partners, to ensure added value and efficient execution of Union research, technological development
and demonstration programmes. Parliament agreed with the Court of Auditors conclusion that the JTIs have been set up to support long-term
industrial investment, in particular research areas but noted that it has taken on average two years to grant financial autonomy to a JTI, with
the Commission usually remaining responsible for one third of the expected operational lifetime of the JTIs.

2013/2249(DEC) - 03/04/2014 Final act
PURPOSE: to grant discharge to the Clean Sky Joint Undertaking for the financial year 2012.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision 2014/623/EU of the European Parliament on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of
the Clean Sky Joint Undertaking for the financial year 2012.
CONTENT: with the present decision, the European Parliament grants discharge to the Executive Director of the Clean Sky Joint Undertaking

invited the Court of Auditors to conduct a detailed analysis of the JUs in a separate report in light of the substantial amounts involved and the
risks - notably reputational - presented.
