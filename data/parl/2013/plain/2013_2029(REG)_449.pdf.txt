Summary

2013/2029(REG) - 16/04/2013 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a decision concerning circumstances in which there is a tied vote on intervention in legal proceedings
(interpretation of Rule 159(3)).
Parliament decided to append the following interpretation to Rule 159(3):
Rule 159(3) is to be interpreted as meaning that, where there is a tied vote on a draft recommendation under Rule 128(4) not to intervene in
proceedings before the Court of Justice of the European Union, such a tie does not signify the adoption of a recommendation that Parliament
should intervene in those proceedings. In such a case, the committee responsible is to be deemed not to have expressed any
recommendation.
