Summary

The European Parliament adopted a resolution tabled by the Committee on Foreign Affairs on the 2012 Progress Report on Iceland and the
post-election perspectives.
It took note of the decision of the newly-elected Icelandic Government not to wait for the end of the accession negotiations before holding a
referendum, and looked forward to the review by the Althingi of the assessment of the accession negotiations. Members awaited further
decisions on the way ahead, including a decision on whether or not to hold a referendum on the continuation of accession negotiations. They
offered to help the Althingi to prepare its assessment of the negotiations.
Members stressed that the Union remained fully committed to completing the accession negotiation process, and hoped that the referendum
would be organised in a foreseeable time frame. They also noted that recent public opinion polls showed that a majority of Icelanders wish to
finalise the accession negotiations.
