In 2012, the tasks and budget of this agency were as follows:

2013/2213(DEC) - 10/09/2013 Court of Auditors: opinion, report
PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work
(EU-OSHA) for the financial year 2012, together with the Agencys reply.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit concerned, amongst others, the annual accounts of the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work.
In the Courts opinion, the Agencys Annual Accounts fairly present, in all material respects, its financial position as of 31 December 2012 and
the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions of its financial rules and the
accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
The Court also considers that the transactions underlying the annual accounts of the Agency for the financial year ended 31 December 2012
are, in all material respects, legal and regular.
The report confirms that the resources available to the Agency in 2012 amounted to EUR 16.4 million.
The report also makes a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of the Agency, accompanied by the latters
response. The main observations may be summarised as follows:
The Courts observations:
carry-overs: the Court noted that the Agencys 2012 budget amounted to EUR 15.3 million, out of which EUR 3.2 million (22 %) were
carried over to 2013. The level of committed appropriations carried over is high for title II (infrastructure) at 36 % and for title III
(operational expenditure) at 33 %. The delays mainly result from a decentralised organisation of procurement procedures which
prevents effective monitoring of the implementation of the procurement plan. It states that in 2012, the cancellation rate was high at
9.5% which mainly resulted from frozen recruitment procedures and an anticipated salary increase which had not yet been paid out.
The Agencys replies:
carry-overs: the Agency stated that cancellations were mainly related to ongoing recruitment procedures and posts being frozen as a
precautionary measure until Management will be in a position to assess the impact of budget uncertainties and constraints over the
upcoming period and upcoming Multiannual Financial Framework. As regards the non-paid out salary increases, the appropriations
which could only be carried over for one year had to be cancelled in the absence of a decision by the Court of Justice.
Lastly, the Court of Auditors report contains a summary of the Agencys activities in 2012. This is focused on the following:
European Risk Observatory: implementation and monitoring 6 specific objectives on research on risks related to OSH;
dissemination of working environment information, exchange of good practice at workplace level;
networking and coordination: further development of focal point network, the Governance of the Agency and liaison with European and
International organisations, institutional capacity building in candidate and potential candidate countries.

2013/2213(DEC) - 20/03/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Petri SARVAMAA (EPP, FI) on discharge in respect of the implementation of the
budget of the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work for the financial year 2012, and called on the European Parliament to grant the
Director of the Agency discharge in respect of the implementation of the Agencys budget for the financial year 2012.
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the Agency for the financial
year 2012 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Members approved the closure of the Agencys accounts.
They made, however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is granted, in addition to the
general recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies.
·

Financing, budget and financial management: Members recalled that the budget of the Agency for the financial year 2012 was EUR
15.3 million. They noted at the same time that that the budget monitoring efforts during the financial year 2012 resulted in a budget
implementation rate of 94.64 %.

·

Carryovers: Members saw with concern that EUR 3 200 000 (22 % of the budget) had been carried over to 2013 and, that the high
level of the carryover might be explained by the multiannual nature of certain projects. They also noted the cancellation rate for
certain appropriations was mainly the result of frozen recruitment procedures.

Members also made a series of observations ontransfers, procurement and recruitment procedures as well as comments on internal controls.
Lastly, they asked the Agency to strengthen transparency and prevent conflicts of interests, as well as make publicly available the Declarations
of Interests of certain members.
