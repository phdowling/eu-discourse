2013/2210(DEC) - 10/09/2013 Court of Auditors: opinion, report
PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living
and Working Conditions (EUROFOUND) for the financial year 2012, together with the Foundations reply.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit concerned, amongst others, the annual accounts of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions
(EUROFOUND).
In the Courts opinion, the Foundations Annual Accounts fairly present, in all material respects, its financial position as of 31 December 2012
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions of its financial rules and the
accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
The Court also considers that the transactions underlying the annual accounts of the Foundation for the financial year ended 31 December
2012 are, in all material respects, legal and regular.
The report confirms that the resources made available for the Foundation in 2012 amounted to EUR 21.4 million.
The report also makes a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of the Foundation, accompanied by the latters
response. The main observations may be summarised as follows:
The Courts observations:
budgetary management: the Court notes that the carry-over of committed appropriations for operational expenditure was high at 50%.
A large part of the carry-overs (71%) concern two projects for which the activities were implemented as planned and as set out in the
Annual Work Programme.
The Foundations replies:
budget implementation: the Foundation stresses the multiannual nature of most of Eurofounds research projects. Eurofound will
continue to scrutinise the carry-over of committed appropriations by annually establishing an amount of appropriations to be carried
over on the basis of its Annual work programme (planned carry-overs) and comparing it to the unplanned amount due to delays or
changes in the work programme implementation (unplanned carry-overs).
Lastly, the Court of Auditors report contains a summary of the Foundationss activities in 2012. This is focused on the following:
implementing the Network of European Observatories (NEO);
monitoring and investigating working conditions;
reporting on employment and competitiveness in Europe as well as industrial relations, workplace development and social cohesion;
communication and sharing ideas and experiences: industrial relations and working conditions development in Europe 2011, work
organisation and innovation and workplace development, working conditions in the retail sector, flexicurity;
monitoring social cohesion and quality of life;
internet monitoring.

2013/2210(DEC) - 20/03/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Petri SARVAMAA (EPP, FI) on discharge in respect of the implementation of the
budget of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions for the financial year 2012, and called on the
European Parliament to grant the Director of the Foundation discharge in respect of the implementation of the Foundations budget for the
financial year 2012.
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the Foundation for the financial
year 2012 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Members approved the closure of the Foundations accounts.
They made, however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is granted, in addition to the
general recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies.
·

Financing, budget and financial management: Members recalled that the budget of the Foundation for the financial year 2012 was
EUR 21 .4 million.

·

Carryovers: Members stressed that while the carry-over of committed appropriations is high at 50 %; this corresponds to payment
schedules and reflects the multiannual nature of the Foundations operations.

Members also made a series of observations on transfers, procurement and recruitment procedures as well as comments on internal controls.
They acknowledged from the Foundation that since 2011, the Foundation had established a system of monitoring and reporting potential
conflicts of interest of members of the Governing Board and the relevant forms were published on the Foundation's website. The report
acknowledged, furthermore, that the Foundations Governing Board discussed a comprehensive strategy on the detection and management of
conflicts of interest and that the policy is currently being finalised on this basis. It called on the Foundation to submit the adopted document to
the discharge authority.
Lastly, Members asked the Foundation to strengthen transparency and prevent conflicts of interests, as well as make publicly available the
Declarations of Interests of certain members.
