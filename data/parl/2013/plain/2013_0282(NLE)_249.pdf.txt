OJ L 032 01.02.2014, p. 0001 Summary

2013/0282(NLE) - 14/08/2013 Initial legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to renew the Agreement on cooperation in science and technology between the European Community and Russia.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: the Agreement on cooperation in science and technology between the European Community and the Government of the
Russian Federation was signed in Brussels on 16 November 2000.
This Agreement stipulates that it shall be concluded for an initial period ending on 31 December 2002 and will be renewable by common
agreement between the parties for additional periods of five years.
By its Decision 2009/313/EC of 30 March 2009, the Council concluded the renewal of the Agreement for a further period of five years.
Renewal of the Agreement for five more years would be in the interest of both Parties so as to maintain continuity in the scientific and
technological relations between Russia and the European Union.
This is the aim of this proposal.
IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. However, following a review of the Agreement, jointly conducted by
independent experts from the EU and Russia, a set of recommendations was drawn up by the appointed expert groups. Both sides took note
of the expert groups' recommendation to renew the Agreement in its current form for another five years at a meeting held on 15 February 2013
in Moscow.
LEGAL BASIS: Article 186 in conjunction with point (v) of Article 218(6)(a) of the treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
CONTENT: under this proposal, the renewal of the Agreement on cooperation in science and technology between the European Community
and Russia, for an additional period of five years, is hereby approved on behalf of the European Union.

The content of the renewed Agreement is identical to that of the current Agreement, which expires on 20 February 2014.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the implementation of the Agreement calls for a financial envelope of EUR 550 000 from 2014 to 2019.

2013/0282(NLE) - 16/09/2013 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to renew the Agreement on cooperation in science and technology between the European Community and Russia.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: the Agreement on cooperation in science and technology between the European Community and Russia was signed in
Brussels on 16 November 2000. This Agreement stipulates that it shall be concluded for an initial period ending on 31 December 2002 and will
be renewable by common agreement between the parties for additional periods of five years.
By its Decision 2009/313/EC, the Council concluded the renewal of the Agreement for a further period of five years.
The Parties to the Agreement consider that a renewal of the Agreement would be in their mutual interest. Therefore, it is proposed to renew it.
The content of the renewed Agreement will be identical to the content of the Agreement.
IMPACT ASSESSMENT: following a review of the Agreement, jointly conducted by independent experts from the EU and Russia, a set of
recommendations was drawn up by the appointed expert groups. Both sides took note of the expert groups' recommendation to renew the
Agreement in its current form for another five years at a meeting between representatives from the European Commission and the Ministry of
Education and Science of the Russian Federation held on 15 February 2013 in Moscow.
LEGAL BASIS: Article 186 in conjunction with point (v) of Article 218(6)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
CONTENT: with the proposed Decision, the Council is called upon to approve, on behalf of the European Union, the renewal of the Agreement
on cooperation in science and technology between the European Community and Russia, for an additional period of five years, on behalf of
the European Union.
The content of the renewed Agreement will be identical to the content of the Agreement, which expires on 20 February 2014.
It should be noted that as a consequence of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon on 1 December 2009, the European Union has
replaced and succeeded the European Community. Therefore any references have been changed to the appropriate wording.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the indicative budgetary implications are estimated at EUR 550 000 in commitments for 2014-2019.

2013/0282(NLE) - 19/12/2013 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading

recommended the European Parliament to give its consent to the renewal of the Agreement on cooperation in science and technology
between the European Community and the Government of the Russian Federation.
Renewal of the Agreement in its current form could also provide a much-needed impetus to the on-going negotiations on a comprehensive
New EU-Russia Agreement, foreseen to replace the existing Partnership and Cooperation Agreement.

2013/0282(NLE) - 15/01/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
