2013/0249(COD) - 17/07/2013 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to amend Regulation (EU) No 99/2013 on the European statistical programme 2013-17 in regard to its financial allocation.
PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an
equal footing with the Council.
BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 99/2013 of the European Parliament and the Council on the European statistical programme 2013-2017
provides the framework and defines the objectives and outputs for the production, development and dissemination of European statistics for
the period from 2013 to 2017.
In its resolution of 13 June 2012 on the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) and own resources, the European Parliament stressed that
the negotiations on the legislative proposals relating to the multiannual programmes would be finalised once an agreement on their financial
envelopes had been reached.
This is why Regulation (EU) No 99/2013 only sets the financial envelope for 2013, covered by the programming period 2007-2013, and invites
the Commission to make a legislative proposal introducing the financial allocation for the period 2014-2017 to the European Parliament and
the Council no later than three months after the adoption of the MFF for the years 2014-2020.
IMPACT ASSESSMENT: an impact assessment was conducted for the proposal for a Regulation on the European statistical programme
2013-17, which included the budget for 2014-2017.
LEGAL BASIS: Article 338(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
CONTENT: this proposal to amend Regulation (EU) No 99/2013 determines the financial allocation for the four years covered by the European

statistical programme 2013-2017 that fall under the programming period 2014 to 2020 of the MFF.
the Union financial envelope for the implementation of the programme for 2013 is set at EUR 57.3 million, covered by the
programming period 2007 to 2013;
the Union financial envelope for the implementation of the programme for 2014 to 2017 is set at EUR 234.8 million, covered by the
programming period 2014 to 2020.
The other provisions of the Regulation on the European Statistical programme 2013-2017 remain unchanged, in particular in regard to the
objectives pursued and the annex, which defines statistical outputs for the five years covered.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: since the specific objectives and statistical outputs for the five-year period are set in the Regulation, the amount
of budget proposed for the period from 2014 to 2017 is EUR 234.8 million , covered by the programming period 2014-2020.

2013/0249(COD) - 21/11/2013 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs adopted the report by Pablo ZALBA BIDEGAIN (EPP, ES) on the proposal for a regulation
of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) No 99/2013 on the European statistical programme 2013-2017.
The committee recommended the European Parliament to adopt its position at first reading taking over the Commission proposal.

2013/0249(COD) - 11/12/2013 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 510 votes to 11, with 35 abstentions, a legislation resolution on the proposal for a regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) No 99/2013 on the European statistical programme 2013-17.
Parliament adopted its position at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure. The text adopted in plenary is the result of a
compromise negotiated between the European Parliament and the Council.
The amended Regulation provides for the Union financial envelope for the implementation of the programme for 2013 to be set at EUR 57.3
million, covered by the programming period 2007 to 2013. The Union financial envelope for the implementation of the programme for 2014 to
2017 should be EUR 234.8 million, covered by the programming period 2014 to 2020.
The Commission should implement the Union financial support in accordance with the Financial Regulation and adopt its decision on annual
appropriations in compliance with the prerogatives of the European Parliament and of the Council.

2013/0249(COD) - 17/12/2013 Final act
PURPOSE: to amend Regulation (EU) No 99/2013 relating to the European statistical programme 2013-17 as regards the financial allocation
for the programme.
LEGISLATIVE ACT: Regulation (EU) No 1383/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) No 99/2013 on
the European statistical programme 2013-17.
CONTENT: Regulation (EU) No 99/2013 provides the framework and lays down the objectives and outputs for the production, development
and dissemination of European statistics for the period 2013 to 2017. The Regulation only sets the financial envelope for 2013, which is
covered by the programming period 2007 to 2013.
Therefore, this amending Regulation provides that:
·

the Union financial envelope for the implementation of the programme for 2013 to be set at EUR 57.3 million, covered by the
programming period 2007 to 2013;

·

the Union financial envelope for the implementation of the programme for 2014 to 2017 should be EUR 234.8 million, covered by the
programming period 2014 to 2020.

The Commission should implement the Union financial support in accordance with the Financial Regulation and adopt its decision on annual
appropriations in compliance with the prerogatives of the European Parliament and of the Council.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 29/12/2013.
