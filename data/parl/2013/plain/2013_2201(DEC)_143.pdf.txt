OJ L 266 05.09.2014, p. 0132 Summary

2013/2201(DEC) - 26/07/2013 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: presentation by the Commission of the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2012, as part of
the 2012 discharge procedure.
Analysis of the accounts of the EU Institutions: Section VI - European Economic and Social Committee.
Legal reminder: the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the year 2012 have been prepared on the basis of the
information presented by the institutions and bodies under Article 129(2) of the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the
European Union. They were prepared in accordance with Title VII of the Financial Regulation and with the accounting principles, rules and
methods set out in the notes to the financial statements.
The objective of the financial statements is to provide information about the financial position, performance and cashflow of a body that is
useful to a wide range of users. The objective is to provide information that is useful for decision making, and to demonstrate the accountability
of the entity for the resources entrusted to it.
Purpose: the document helps to bring insight into the EU budget mechanism and the way in which the budget has been managed and spent in
2012. It recalls that the European Union's operational expenditure covers the various headings of the financial framework and takes different
forms, depending on how the money is paid out and managed. In accordance with the Financial Regulation, the Commission implements the
general budget using the following methods: direct or indirect centralised management (by means of bodies or agencies of public law or other);
decentralised management where the Commission delegates certain tasks for the implementation of the budget to third countries; and, thirdly,
shared management where budget implementation tasks are delegated to Member States, in areas such as agricultural expenditure and
structural actions.
The document also presents the different financial actors involved in the budget process (accounting officers, internal officers and authorising
officers) and recalls their respective roles in the context of the tasks of sound financial management.
Amongst the other legal elements relating to the implementation of the EU budget presented in this document, the paper focuses on the
following issues:
accounting principles applicable to the management of EU spending (business continuity, consistency of accounting methods,
comparability of information ...);
consolidation methods of figures for all major controlled entities (the consolidated financial statements of the EU comprise all
significant controlled entities institutions, organisations and agencies);
the recognition of financial assets in the EU (tangible and intangible assets, financial assets and other miscellaneous investments);
the way in which EU public expenditure is committed and spent, including pre-financing (cash advances intended for the benefit of an
EU organ);
the means of recovery following irregularities detected;
the modus operandi of the accounting system;
the audit process followed by the European Parliament's granting of the discharge.
To recap, the final control is the discharge of the budget for a given financial year. The discharge represents the political aspect of the external
control of budget implementation and is the decision by which the European Parliament, acting on a Council recommendation, "releases" the
Commission from its responsibility for management of a given budget by marking the end of that budget's existence.
The document also details specific expenditure of the institutions, in particular: i) pensions of former Members and officials of institutions; ii)
joint sickness insurance scheme and iii) buildings.
Lastly, the document presents a series of tables and detailed technical indicators on (i) the balance sheet; (ii) the economic outturn account;
(iii) cashflow tables; (iv) technical annexes concerning the financial statements.
2) Implementation of appropriations under Section VI of the budget for the financial year 2012: the document also comprises a series of
detailed tables, the most important concerning the implementation of the budget. Concerning the expenditure of the European Economic and
Social Committee (EESC), the information drawn from the EESCs Annual Activity Report 2012 shows that:
commitments granted to this institution for 2012 were EUR 128.8 million;
amount actually spent: EUR 124.7 million;
the rate of budgetary implementation was 96.8%
3) Budgetary implementation - conclusions: in more general and political terms, the Committees budgetary implementation for the financial
year 2012 was marked by the following:
in the context of the Danish Presidency: promotion of sustainable production and consumption in the EU; 7th Environmental Action
Programme (EAP), follow-up to the 6th EAP; Energy education; the digital market as a driver for growth; people with disabilities: employment
and accessibility;
in the context of the Cypriot Presidency: strengthening the participatory processes and the involvement of local authorities, NGOs and social
partners in the implementation of Europe 2020; getting EU energy islands connected - growth, competitiveness, solidarity and sustainability in
the EU internal energy market; developing a macro-regional strategy for the Mediterranean what benefits for island Member States.
In parallel, internally, the EESCs activities involved:

budgetary consolidation and the management of the budget procedure with a view to the complete autonomy of the Committees
budget;
mid-term evaluation of the cooperation agreement with the Committee of the Regions;
modernisation of member support services and the digitisation of the archives (Mota Project);
creation of a pilot action to strengthen the involvement of civil society in the Committees activities, thanks to the creation of a data
base of civil society organisations.

2013/2201(DEC) - 21/03/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Bogus?aw SONIK (EPP, PL) in which it called on the European Parliament to
grant discharge to the Secretary-General of the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) in respect of the implementation of the
European Economic and Social Committee's budget for the financial year 2012.
Members welcomed the fact that, on the basis of its audit work, the Court of Auditors concluded that the payments as a whole for the year
ended on 31 December 2012 for administrative and other expenditure of the institutions and bodies were free from material error. They
observed that no significant weaknesses had been identified in respect of the audited topics related to human resources and procurement for
the EESC.
Budgetary and financial management: Members noted that in 2012 the EESC budget amounted to EUR 128.816 million, with a utilisation rate
of 96.8%. They stated that the 96.8% budget implementation rate for 2012 is higher than rate for 2011. They noted the rise by 0.2% in the
2012 budget compared to the previous annual budget. They supported the EESC's efforts to limit the budgets of the coming years, thereby
ensuring a flat rate increase.
EESCs framework action: Members also made a series of observations on the daily management of the EESC and called for:
improvements in interinstitutional cooperation to rationalise human resources in the EESC Joint Services and/Committee of the
Regions (CoR ), especially in translation;
continuous monitoring of the staff structure to ensure that the organisation of posts is fully efficient and helps to improve the allocation
of the budget;
the preparation of negotiations on the new administrative cooperation agreement with the CoR, to achieve budget savings between
the two institutions;
increased use of videoconferencing;
further reductions in interpretation costs;
strengthening cooperation with other institutions to develop a unified methodology of presenting the translation costs;
the modernisation of the IT infrastructure.

2013/2201(DEC) - 03/04/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a decision concerning the discharge to be granted to the Secretary-General of the European Economic and
Social Committee (EESC) in respect of the implementation of the Agencys budget for the financial year 2012.
In its resolution accompanying the discharge decision, adopted by 518 votes to 81 with 6 abstentions, Parliament concluded, with the Court of
Auditors, that the payments as a whole for the year ended on 31 December 2012 for administrative and other expenditure of the institutions
and bodies were free from material error.
Parliament also noted with satisfaction that in its 2012 annual report, the Court of Auditors observed that no significant weaknesses had been
identified in respect of the audited topics related to the human resources and the procurement for the European Economic and Social
Committee (EESC).
Budgetary and financial management: Parliament noted that in 2012 the EESC budget amounted to EUR 128.816 million, with a utilisation rate
of 96.8%. It stated that the 96.8% budget implementation rate for 2012 is higher than rate for 2011. It noted the rise by 0.2% in the 2012
budget compared to the previous annual budget. It supported the EESC's efforts to limit the budgets of the coming years, thereby ensuring a
flat rate increase.
EESCs framework action: Parliament also made a series of observations on the daily management of the EESC and called for:
improvements in interinstitutional cooperation to rationalise human resources in the EESC Joint Services and/Committee of the
Regions (CoR ), especially in translation;
continuous monitoring of the staff structure to ensure that the organisation of posts is fully efficient and helps to improve the allocation
of the budget;
the preparation of negotiations on the new administrative cooperation agreement with the CoR, to achieve budget savings between
the two institutions;
increased use of videoconferencing;
further reductions in interpretation costs;
the modernisation of the IT infrastructure.
Lastly, Parliament called for the rationalisation of human resources in the Joint Services (EESC/CoR) and in translation. It found the on-going
contacts between the EESC, the CoR and Parliament in this matter a positive contribution to the rationalisation of resources.
