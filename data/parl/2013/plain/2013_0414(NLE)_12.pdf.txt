2013/0414(NLE) - 22/01/2014 Initial legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to conclude a Cooperation Agreement on a Civil Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) between the European Community
and its Member States and Morocco.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act.
BACKGROUND: the European Commission, on the basis of a negotiating mandate from the Council, conducted negotiations and initialled the

allows for closer cooperation with Morocco in the area of satellite navigation. It will implement a number of elements of the European satellite
navigation programmes.

Reason for the Agreement: Morocco has know-how in space technology and applications. It would like to develop the use of satellite
radionavigation on its territory and in the surrounding region (western Mediterranean and West Africa), focusing on applications specific to this
region. Moroccan and European firms have had industrial cooperation links in the space sector for several years, providing a solid foundation
on which to build and extend cooperation in this field which is of great importance for both parties.
Sector cooperation: the sectors for cooperation in satellite navigation and timing envisaged by the agreement are:
scientific research,
industrial manufacturing,
training, application,
service and market development, trade,
radio-spectrum issues,
integrity issues,
standardisation and certification.
The agreement is expected to reinforce the joint activities in these sectors to the benefit of the citizens, industries and the cientific communities
of the parties
Territorial provisions: Bulgaria and Romania are to become parties to the agreement by the conclusion of a protocol in accordance with Art
6(2) of the Act concerning the conditions of accession of the Republic of Bulgaria and Romania and the adjustments to the treaties on which
the European Union is founded.
Croatia shall also become a party in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Treaty.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the Agreement has no financial impact on the EU budget.
