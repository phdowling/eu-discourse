Commission response to text adopted in plenary

Summary

2013/2852(RSP) - 23/10/2013 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a resolution tabled by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and
Home Affairs on the e-Justice Action Plan 2014-2018.
It recalled that the first multiannual European e-Justice Action Plan covered the 2009-2013 period and sought to make justice and the legal
system more accessible to citizens, and to improve the mutual understanding of practitioners and administrations by providing electronic tools
for information and cooperation. The time has now come to decide on the e-Justice Action Plan for 2014-2018. Members considered that the
EUs Justice Programme 2014-2020 should allow for the funding of successful European and national e-Justice projects, which should have
real European added value for citizens. It believed that legislative work, e-Justice projects and financial programme planning should be
streamlined.
Recalling also that the e-Justice Portal was launched in 2010, Parliament emphasised the importance of the portal for the aim of building a true

European judicial culture by hosting online tools for judicial training and it called on the Member States and the Commission to extend the
applications available on the e-Justice Portal.
Members welcomed the development of e-Justice tools to facilitate the use of certain EU instruments, such as the European Payment Order
and the Small Claims Procedure, as well as information systems in the area of Justice and Home Affairs, notably the European Criminal
Records Information System (ECRIS) and the Schengen Information System (SIS) II.
They considered that e-Justice was a means of enabling greater access to legal and judicial information, and to judicial and administrative
proceedings, for both citizens and practitioners, and pointed out that e-Justice systems, by their very nature, tended to decrease the costs of
judicial and administrative proceedings, in particular through automation of the exchange of information, the service of documents and the
translation of certain procedural acts. In view of cost-efficiency considerations, projects should remain voluntary.
