2013/2234(DEC) - 26/07/2013 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: presentation by the Commission of the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2012, as part of
the 2012 discharge procedure.
Analysis of the accounts of the Euratom Supply Agency (ESA).
CONTENT: this Commission document sets out the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2012 as
prepared on the basis of the information presented by the institutions, organisations and bodies of the EU, in accordance with Article 129 (2) of
the Financial Regulation applicable to the EU's General Budget, including the Euratom Supply Agency (ESA).
In 2012, the tasks and budget of this agency were as follows:
description of ESA's tasks: the ESA, which is located in Luxembourg, was established by Council Decision 2008/114/EC, Euratom. Its
main tasks are to: (i) provide expertise, information and advice to the EU on the market in nuclear materials and services and; (ii)
monitor the market in this area.
ESA's budget for the 2012 financial year: the final annual accounts may be found in the document entitled "Annual Accounts 2012 and
Report on Budgetary and Financial Management".
N.B. The European Parliament decided in its vote on the 2012 Budget to restore, after four years, the Budget heading 32.01.06 Euratom
contribution for operation of the Supply Agency. As a result, for 2012, the Agency was granted a subsidy of EUR 98 000 by the Commission,
with a total budget of EUR 140 000 (including financial revenues) for 2012.

2013/2234(DEC) - 10/09/2013 Court of Auditors: opinion, report
PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the Euratom Supply Agency (ESA) for the year 2012,
together with the Agencys reply.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit concerned, amongst others, the annual accounts of the ESA.
In the Courts opinion, the Euratom Supply Agencys Annual Accounts fairly present, in all material respects, its financial position as of 31
December 2012 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions of its Financial

Regulation and the accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
The Court also considers that the transactions underlying the annual accounts of the Agency for the financial year ended 31 December 2012
are, in all material respects, legal and regular.
The report also makes a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of the Agency, accompanied by the latters
response. The main observations may be summarised as follows:
The Courts observations:
·

the Court wishes to draw attention to the fact that between 2008 and 2011, the Agency did not receive its own budget and the
European Commission directly financed and discharged all expenditure. The Court had considered this situation to be at odds with
the Statutes of the Agency. Following the Courts comments, the Commission granted the Agency its own budget amounting to EUR
98 000. Although Article 54 of the Treaty Establishing the European Atomic Energy Community and Article 6 of the Agencys Statutes
provide that it shall have financial autonomy, most of the Agencys expenditure (staff, office space and IT systems) is still financed
directly by the Commission. These provisions are contradictory and go against the financial autonomy required of the Agency.

The Agencys reply: the Agency agrees with the Court of Auditors that the amount of the subsidy allows it to pay only a minor part of its
administrative expenditure, while the main part still needs to be directly financed by the Commission. It does not see a contradiction between
the provisions of its Statutes.
The Court of Auditors report contains a summary of the Agencys activities in 2012 . This consisted of about 270 transactions, including
contracts, amendments and notifications of the front-end activities. The Agency also provided input to the procedure regarding its budget for
2013. The ESA published several reports and the six-monthly Nuclear News Digests.

2013/2234(DEC) - 20/03/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Petri SARVAMAA (EPP, FI) on discharge in respect of the implementation of the
budget of the Euratom Supply Agency for the financial year 2012.
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the Agency for the financial
year 2012 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Members approve the closure of the Offices accounts.
However, they made a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is granted, in addition to the
general recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies.
Recalling that, according to its financial statements, the final budget of the Euratom Supply Agency for the financial year 2012 was EUR
104 000, Members reminded the Commission of the Court of Auditors' observation that between 2008 and 2011, the Agency did not receive its
own budget and the Commission directly financed and discharged all expenditure, a situation which the Court of Auditors considered to be at
odds with the Statutes of the Agency.
They also noted with concern that for 2012, although the Commission granted the Agency its own budget amounting to EUR 98 000 (EUR 104
000 including financial revenue from its own investments), nevertheless, most of the Agencys expenditure was still financed directly by the
Commission. Members called the Commission to provide an explanation for this situation.

2013/2234(DEC) - 03/04/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a decision concerning the discharge to be granted to the Director-General of the Euratom Supply Agency in
respect of the implementation of the Agency's budget for the financial year 2012. The vote on the discharge decision approved the closure of
the accounts (in accordance with Annex VI, Article 5(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament.
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the Agency for the financial
year 2012 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Parliament adopted by 481 votes to 62, with 27 abstentions,
a resolution containing a series of recommendations that form an integral part of the discharge decision and as well as the general
recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies.
These recommendations are summarised as follows:
Financial statements: recalling that the final budget of the Euratom Supply Agency for the financial year 2012 was EUR 104 000,
Parliament reminded the Commission of the Court of Auditors' observation that between 2008 and 2011, the Agency did not receive its
own budget and the Commission directly financed and discharged all expenditure, a situation which the Court of Auditors considered
to be at odds with the Statutes of the Agency. It noted with concern that for 2012, although the Commission granted the Agency its
own budget amounting to EUR 104 000 including financial revenue from its own investments, most of the Agencys expenditure was
still financed directly by the Commission. The Commission is called upon to provide an explanation for this situation.
Budget and financial management: Parliament noted that budget monitoring efforts during the financial year 2012 resulted in a budget
implementation rate of 98.51%.

2013/2234(DEC) - 03/04/2014 Final act
PURPOSE: to grant discharge to the Euratom Supply Agency for the financial year 2012.

integral part of the discharge decision (please refer to the summary of the opinion of 3 April 2014).

Commission directly financed and discharged all expenditure, a situation which the Court of Auditors considered to be at odds with the
Statutes of the Agency.
