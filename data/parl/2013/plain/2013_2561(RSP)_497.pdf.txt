Summary

The European Parliament adopted by 58 votes to 1, with no abstentions, a resolution the situation in Bangladesh.
The resolution was tabled as a joint resolution by the EPP, S&D, ALDE, ECR, GUE/NGL, Greens/EFA Groups and Jaroslav PAKA (EFD, SK).
Parliament is deeply concerned about the recent outbreak of violence in Bangladesh following Bangladeshs International Crimes Tribunal
(ICT) verdicts in January and February 2013 against Abdul Kalam Azad for crimes against humanity committed during the war of
independence in 1971, and against Delwar Hossain Sayeedi, Vice-President of the Jamaat-e-Islami party for charges including persecution of
the Hindu minority. Both were sentenced to death.
Parliament acknowledges the need for accountability for the crimes committed during the 1971 war. Whilst stressing the important role of the
ICT in this matter, Parliament reiterates its strong opposition to use of the death penalty and calls on Bangladesh: (i) to commute all death
sentences; (ii) in view of report irregularities such as the alleged intimidation and forced disappearance of witnesses, to ensure that the ICT
adheres strictly to national and international judicial standards.
Parliament condemns the violence of Jamaat-e-Islami supporters and affiliated parties against law enforcement officers, against those who
support the verdicts of the ICT, and against religious and ethnic minorities. It also expresses concern about the high number of casualties
following violent protests by the Jamaat Party leading to more than 60 deaths, calling on Bangladeshi security forces to use maximum restraint
and avoid lethal force.
All political leaders are asked to de-escalate tensions to avoid further violence.
