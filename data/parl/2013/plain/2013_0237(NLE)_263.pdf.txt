2013/0237(NLE) - 10/07/2013 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to amend Regulation (EC) No 219/2007 on the establishment of a Joint Undertaking to develop the new generation European air
traffic management system (SESAR) as regards the extension of the Joint Undertaking until 2024.
PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to
follow its opinion.
BACKGROUND: the Single European Sky Air Traffic Management Research and Development project (the 'SESAR project') aims to
modernise the air traffic management ('ATM') in Europe and represents the technological pillar of the Single European Sky (SES). It aims by
2030 to provide the Union with a high performance air traffic control infrastructure which will enable the safe and environmentally friendly

development of air transport.
The first phase of the definition process ran from 2004 to 2008 and delivered the first edition of the European ATM Master plan (the 'ATM
Master Plan'). The ATM Master Plan identifies three steps in the SESAR development process: Time Based operations (Step 1), Trajectory
Based Operations (Step 2) and Performance Based Operations (Step 3).
SESAR JU (SJU) was set up by Regulation (EC) No 219/2007 for the purpose of managing the activities of the development process of the
SESAR project under the Unions 2007-2013 financial perspectives. The JUs work programme, covered by the Unions 2007-2013 financial
perspectives, addresses all elements of Step 1 and approximately 80% of Step 2 of the ATM Master Plan. The related activities should be
completed by 2016. The remaining activities of Step 2 and those related to Step 3 should start in 2014 under the Unions 2014-2020 financial
framework.
In accordance with Regulation (EC) No 219/2007, the JU should cease to exist on 31 December 2016. To continue the development of the
activities defined in the ATM Master Plan, it is necessary to extend the duration of the Joint Undertaking until 2024, which reflects the duration
of the Unions 2014-2020 financial framework and allows 4 additional years for completion of projects that would be initiated by the end of that
period.
IMPACT ASSESSMENT: an ex ante evaluation confirms the usefulness and efficiency of an extension of the SJU under the Horizon 2020
framework programme to reach the SES performance objectives.
LEGAL BASIS: Articles 187 and 188 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
CONTENT: as it is necessary to continue research and innovation on air traffic management (ATM) beyond 2016, this legislative proposal
seeks to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 219/2007 to extend the duration of the SJU until 2024.
The proposed amendments also seek to:
entitle the SESAR JU to award grants to its Members and other participants, considering Horizon 2020 Rules for Participation;
remove the limitation of 8 years on the employment contracts of temporary agents and contract agents, which could hinder the
continuity of the employment of experienced staff for a body having a limited duration;
limit the mandate of the Executive Director in place on 1.1.2009 to 31 December 2016 to ensure coherence with the amending Council
Regulation No 1361/2008;
terminate by 31 December 2016 the membership of the current members of the JU who do not contribute to activities that will be
financed by Horizon 2020 under the 2014-2020 financial framework;
clarify the procedure for the award of grants, taking into account the Rules for participation laid down in Horizon 2020;
change the term of office of the Executive Director from 3 years into 5 years, renewable once;
take into account the standard provision on the protection of the Union financial interests and the 2013 Financial Regulation.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the Commission proposes to provide again for a multiannual financial envelope to be imputed into the Union
budget for the period from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020 coinciding with the new multiannual financial framework. It proposes
earmarking an amount of up to EUR 600 million (including EFTA contribution) for the reference period. This amount is indicative because it is
subject to the negotiations currently on-going on the Multi-Annual Financial Framework for the period 2014-2020 and to negotiations with
private partners.
The activities to be carried out under the 2014-2020 Multi Financial Framework cover the highest maturity level of Step 2, for which the
technology and operations are expected to be available by 2016, and the full scope of Step 3 Performance based operations of the ATM
Master Plan.
It should be noted that the SJUs work programme financed under the Unions 2007-2013 financial perspectives is proceeding and is managed
so as to complete its activities by 31.12.16, while new activities will be gradually phased in from 2014 onwards.

2013/0237(NLE) - 29/01/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Industry, Research and Energy adopted, in the framework of a special legislative procedure (Parliament consultation), the
report by Britta THOMSEN (S&D, DK) on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 219/2007 on establishment of a
Joint Undertaking to develop the new generation European air traffic management system (SESAR) as regards the extension of the Joint
Undertaking until 2024.
The committee approved the Commission proposal subject to the following amendments:
SESAR Joint Undertaking: Members stipulated that SESAR should follow the research and innovation objectives established in Horizon 2020.
In order to take account of the duration of the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014-2020), all calls for
proposals should be launched by 31 December 2020.
Scope of work: Members introduced a new article which aims to clarify the scope of activities of the SESAR Joint Undertaking, in particular
with respect to the relevant Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) covered by its research programme. The rules of participation also call for a
greater consideration of the TRL-concept to stipulate funding levels, which is taken up in this article with a view to the funding rates used in
indirect actions.
Unions financial contribution: the maximum Union contribution covering the costs under the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020
should be EUR 570 million (compared to the EUR 600 million as proposed by the Commission), including contributions from the countries of
the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), paid from the budget appropriations allocated to Horizon 2020 and in particular from the specific
objective "Smart, green and integrated transport" under the Horizon 2020 priority "Societal challenges".
The Commission could oppose the use of the Union contribution for purposes that it considers to be contrary to the principles of Horizon 2020.
Internal audit: the Joint Undertaking shall be free to organise its own internal audit capability.
Evaluation: the Commission should organise independent evaluations of the implementation of this Regulation, the results obtained by the

Joint Undertaking, that focus in particular on the impact and effectiveness of these concrete results achieved under the given term, in
accordance with the ATM Master Plan. The evaluations should also cover the working methods, as well as the general financial situation of the
Joint Undertaking. The results of those evaluations should be presented to the European Parliament and to the Council.
The results of the 2017 independent interim evaluation of the Joint Undertaking shall be taken into account in the interim evaluation of Horizon
2020.
In order to respond to unforeseen situations or to new developments and needs the Commission may, following the interim evaluation of
Horizon 2020, review, within the annual budgetary procedure, the budget of the Joint Undertaking.
Rules of participation: in accordance with the principles of transparency and non-discrimination, Members called for calls for proposals
organised by the Joint Undertaking shall be published on the web-based Horizon 2020 Participant Portal.
Conflict of interest: the report introduced new provisions as regards a rigorous policy on conflicts of interest requiring parties to declare the
absence or presence of such conflicts of interest and defining a procedure to deal with them as all too often declarations of interest are made
but not acted upon.

2013/0237(NLE) - 15/04/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 613 votes to 45, with 8 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the proposal for a Council regulation
