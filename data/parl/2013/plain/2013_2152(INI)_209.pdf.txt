Summary

2013/2152(INI) - 29/11/2013 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Foreign Affairs adopted the own-initiative report by Eduard KUKAN (EPP, SK) on the Annual Report on Human Rights in
the World 2012 and the European Union's policy on the matter.
General points: Members considered human rights to be at the centre of the EUs relations with all third countries, including its strategic
partners. EU human rights policy needs to be consistent in complying with the Treaty obligations, ensuring coherence between internal and
external policies and avoiding double standards in external policies.
Accordingly, Members called for the adoption of EU Foreign Affairs Council Conclusions on human rights and strategic partners that would
establish a common threshold in terms of the human rights concerns . They called on the Vice-President of the Commission / High
Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security (VP/HR), the EU Special Representative for Human Rights and the EEAS to
pursue these commitments and mainstream human rights and democracy in the EUs relations with its partners.
Recognising that EU institutions and all Member States should take a firm and coherent approach to human rights abuses worldwide,
Members called for close cooperation on the EU Strategic Framework on Human Rights and Democracy with Council.
The 2012 EU Annual Report: recalling the main objectives of the annual report as well as the actions taken by the EU to promote human rights
and democracy worldwide, Members called for use to be made of Parliaments achievements and potential, including the numerous studies
and analyses carried out by Parliament. They encouraged the VP/HR and the EEAS to report on the EU action taken on Parliaments
resolutions, including on urgency resolutions. They also welcomed the EU Annual Report on Human Rights and Democracy in the World in
2012, as it showed the efforts that the EU is deploying to promote the mainstreaming of human rights, gender equality, democracy and good
governance in development policies and instruments.
Members discussed the content of the report as follows:
EU Policy Framework: the report underlines the need for a general consensus and enhanced coordination of the EUs human rights policy
between the EU institutions and the Member States. It stressed that credibility requires adequate resourcing of dedicated human rights
policies and regretted the fact that economic, social and cultural rights remain largely neglected by the EUs human rights policy. Noting that
the current Action Plan would be concluded at the end of 2014, Members expected the VP/HR and the EEAS to engage in a timely review and
consultations with the Member States, the Commission, Parliament and civil society, leading to a new Action Plan that would take effect in
2015.
Members also made some recommendations on the following points :
·

the EU Special Representative for Human Rights should enhance the visibility, mainstreaming, coherence, consistency and
effectiveness of EU human rights policy ;

·

EU Guidelines on Human Rights should involve more involvement with the European Parliament regarding their definition and
implementation ;

·

human rights dialogues with third countries should be more meaningful and effective;

·

human rights country strategies and human rights focal points should entail transparency regarding the contents of the country
strategies;

·

human rights in the EUs trade policy should include legally binding and non-negotiable human rights clauses in the EUs international
agreements concluded with third countries, with Parliament withholding its consent to international agreements when serious
breaches of human rights occur;

·

human rights in EU development policies should include extensive impact assessments of EU development cooperation projects.

European Union policy on transition processes : Members noted that the Union should give its full support to countries that have dislodged
authoritarian regimes and are undergoing a transition to democracy by supporting civil society as a crucial actor. Considers the EUs external
financial instruments an important tool for promoting and defending EU values abroad, including the European Instrument for Democracy and

Human Rights (EIDHR).
They welcomed the creation of the European Endowment for Democracy (EED), and recommended :
·

an enlargement process as a means of supporting democratisation and enhancing human rights protection;

·

a Neighbourhood Policy differentiating between the Southern and Eastern dimensions of the Neighbourhood Policy in order to target
the specific needs of each country in the light of the deteriorating human rights situation in Ukraine, Belorussia, Egypt and especially
in Syria ;

·

peace-building measures following crisis periods, through utilising all international bodies such as the ICC. Members welcomed the
launch in January 2014 of the EU Aid Volunteers initiative, which would create opportunities for more than 8 000 EU and non-EU
citizens to be trained for and deployed to humanitarian operations worldwide;

·

measures for trapped transition countries, where human rights defenders are particularly vulnerable, such as Russia, Cuba, China,
North Korea or the Sahel;

·

following up on the Election Observation Missions;

·

measures in support of freedom of expression, with emphasis on the right of free access to the internet as a form of free expression.

EU support for universal human rights: Members supported fully the affirmative position taken by the EU regarding the promotion and
protection of all human rights, as well as the pledge to speak out against any attempt to undermine respect for the universality of human rights.
They reiterated their full support for the indivisibility and universality of human rights.
Members particularly expressed support for the UN human rights system and for the International Criminal Court (ICC). They called on the EU
Member States to fully implement the Rome Statute by aligning national legislation with all Statute obligations and to comply with the ICCs
requests for assistance and cooperation at all stages of the Courts proceedings.
Once again, Members reiterated their univocal opposition to capital punishment, and considered implementation of a universal moratorium
with a view to the global abolition of the death penalty to be a central objective of the EUs policy on human rights.
Lastly, they called for :
European companies to ensure that their activities respect human rights standards, including when operating outside the EU ;
effective and strong measures in the fight against all forms of discrimination, including with regard to LGBT persons ;
reaffirmation of the principles of freedom of conscience and religion, condemning the blasphemy laws in Afghanistan, Bangladesh,
Egypt, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia which allow for imprisonment and the death penalty;
the rights and empowerment of women and children, condemning again all forms of violence against women including domestic
violence, genital mutilation, sexual abuse of young girls, early and forced marriages, feminicides and other gender-based human rights
violations.)

The resolution also reiterated its view that the country reports should be further strengthened and should reflect the implementation of the
human rights country strategies and thus refer to specific benchmarks based on a set of indicators to assess both positive and negative
trends.
Parliament discussed the content of the report as follows:
EU Policy Framework: Parliament underlined the need for a general consensus and enhanced coordination of the EUs human rights policy
between the EU institutions and the Member States. It stressed that credibility requires adequate resourcing of dedicated human rights

and consultations with the Member States, the Commission, Parliament and civil society, leading to a new Action Plan that would take effect in
2015.
Members also made some recommendations on the following points :

the EU Special Representative for Human Rights should enhance the visibility, mainstreaming, coherence, consistency and
effectiveness of EU human rights policy, in particular on womens rights and the rights of all minorities, and to strike the right balance
between silent and public diplomacy in carrying out his mandate;
EU Guidelines on Human Rights should involve more involvement with the European Parliament regarding their definition and
implementation and the correct implementation of the human rights of LGBTI persons;
human rights dialogues with third countries should be more meaningful and effective;

strategies;

pro-European processes in Ukraine and condemns the recent use of force against peaceful public demonstrations in Kiev;
peace-building measures following crisis periods, through utilising all international bodies such as the ICC. Parliament welcomed the
launch in January 2014 of the EU Aid Volunteers initiative, which would create opportunities for more than 8 000 EU and non-EU
citizens to be trained for and deployed to humanitarian operations worldwide;
urgent need to bring about a fair and lasting solution to the conflict in the Middle East with a view to achieving a two-State solution an
