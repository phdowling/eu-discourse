OJ L 169 07.06.2014, p. 0108 Summary

2013/0245(NLE) - 10/07/2013 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to prolong the Joint Undertaking (JU) in the field of Fuel Cells and Hydrogen (the FCH 2 JU).
PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to
follow its opinion.

BACKGROUND: the framework programme for research and innovation Horizon 2020 encourages public-private partnerships (PPP) in
research and innovation with a view to tackling the major challenges facing Europe.
This proposal provides for a prolongation of the Joint Undertaking in the field of Fuel Cells and Hydrogen launched under the Seventh
Framework Programme (2007-2013). Since its establishment, the FCH 2 JU has demonstrated the potential of hydrogen as an energy carrier,
and of fuel cells as energy converters, to offer a pathway for clean systems that reduce emissions, enhance energy security, and stimulate the
economy. The interim evaluation of the FCH JU has shown that the JU has served as a platform for creating of a solid partnership, for
leveraging public and private funding and for the strong involvement of industry, in particular SMEs.
Although the FCH sector has reached an advanced stage of innovation it is still a premature and vulnerable one. The existence of a joint
undertaking in the field of fuel cells and hydrogen is needed in order to:
address two key challenges for the EU - to ensure the energy security of supply and to boost/maintain competitiveness;
tackle a series of obstacles to effective research and innovation in this area; industry on its own cannot invest in view of these
obstacles, and hence public support is needed;
counteract the fragmentation of the Member States programmes and achieve the coordinated, long-term, large-scale, transnational,
cross-sectoral effort required;
help industry to set a long-term research and innovation agenda, create the necessary critical mass, leverage private investment,
provide stable funding, facilitate knowledge sharing, reduce risk, lower costs and reduce time to market.
IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the proposal is accompanied by a summary of the impact assessment.
LEGAL BASIS: Articles 187 and Article 188 (first paragraph) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
CONTENT: the proposal seeks to create a joint undertaking in the field of Fuel Cells and Hydrogen 2 (the FCH 2 JU) for a period running from
1 January 2014 to 31 December 2024. The FCH 2 JU replaces and succeeds the previous FCH JU launched under the seventh framework
programme.
The general objective of the proposed continuation of the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen (FCH) JU in Horizon 2020 is to contribute to implementing
an optimal research and innovation programme at EU level and to develop a strong, sustainable and globally competitive fuel cells and
hydrogen sector in the Union, in particular to:
reduce the production cost of fuel cell systems to be used in transport applications, while increasing their lifetime to levels competitive
with conventional technologies;
increase the electrical efficiency and the durability of the different fuel cells used for power production, while reducing costs, to levels
competitive with conventional technologies;
increase the energy efficiency of production of hydrogen from water electrolysis while reducing capital costs, so that the combination
of the hydrogen and the fuel cell system is competitive with the alternatives available in the marketplace;
demonstrate on a large scale the feasibility of using hydrogen as a competitive energy storage medium for electricity produced from
renewable energy sources.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the EU budget, totalling up to EUR 700 million at current prices (including EFTA), will come from the Secure,
clean and efficient energy and the Smart, green and integrated transport Horizon 2020 societal challenges budget.
The administrative costs of the FCH 2 Joint Undertaking shall not exceed EUR 40 million and shall be covered in cash, on an annual basis,
divided equally between the Union and the Members other than the Union. The Union shall contribute with 50%, the Industry Grouping with
43% and the Research Grouping with 7%.

2013/0245(NLE) - 06/02/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Industry, Research and Energy adopted, in the framework of a special legislative procedure (consultation of Parliament),
the report by Vladko Todorov PANAYOTOV (ADLE, BG) on the proposal for a Council regulation on the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen 2 Joint
Undertaking.
The committee approved the Commission proposal subject to the following amendments:
FCH 2 Joint Undertaking: in order to take account of the duration of the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation
(2014-2020), all calls for proposals should be launched by 31 December 2020.
Objectives: the Joint Undertaking should have the following objectives:
·

contribute to the implementation of the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, and in particular at least three of the specific
objectives under part III "Societal Challenges;

·

contribute to the objectives of the Joint Technology Initiative on Fuel Cells and Hydrogen, through dissemination and capacity
building across the Member States;

·

increase the energy efficiency of production of hydrogen from water electrolysis and from renewable energy sources while reducing
capital and operational costs.

·

strengthen the connection between demonstration projects and results and translation of those research results into pilot applications
and attractive market solutions;

·

contribute to developing denser infrastructure and to increasing public awareness and acceptance by transferring the knowhow and
expertise of the stronger performing Member States to the weaker performing Member States by way of demonstrations and pilot
projects and by WestEast centres,

·

support development of advanced technologies for recovery of metals, critical for the development and deployment of FCH
technologies from Union sources, including technological by-products and waste, and

·

reduce the use of the "critical raw materials", as defined by the Commission, by identifying relevant substitutes where technically
feasible and economically justifiable.

Scope of activities: Members inserted a new article to clarify the scope of activities of the Joint Undertaking, in particular with respect to the
relevant Technology Readiness Levels covered by its research programme. The Rules on Participation also call for a greater consideration of
the Technology Readiness Levels concept in relation to funding levels, which is taken up in this article with a view to the funding rates used in
indirect actions.
Financial contribution: the maximum Union contribution, including contributions from countries of the European Free Trade Association
(EFTA), to the FCH 2 Joint Undertaking to cover administrative costs and operational costs should be EUR 665 million (rather than EUR 700
million in the Commission proposal). The contribution should be paid from the appropriations in the general budget of the Union allocated to
the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme and in particular from appropriations allocated to the specific objectives "Secure, Clean and Efficient
Energy and "Smart, green and integrated transport".
Additional activities carried out by private members: while the additional activities to be carried out by private members are a welcome addition
to the leverage effect of the JTI, they should not be subject to auditing. Additional activities should be planned and carried-out accordingly,
determined clearly as in-kind contributions, and reported on annually.
Evaluation: by 30 June 2017 the Commission shall organise an independent interim evaluation of the Joint Undertaking. The results of the
independent interim evaluation should be taken into account in the interim evaluation of Horizon 2020.
In order to respond to unforeseen situations or to new developments and needs the Commission may, following the interim evaluation of
Horizon 2020 review the budget of the Joint Undertaking within the annual budgetary procedure.
Rules for participation and dissemination: work plans may provide for justified additional conditions according to specific policy requirements or
to the nature and objective of the action, inter alia, that coordinators shall be constituent entities of a Member of the FCH 2 Joint
Undertaking other than the Union. This should under no condition and throughout the programme raise undue conditions or restrain that willing
entities can become a constituent entity of a Member. The principles of openness and transparency shall apply throughout the duration of the
FCH 2 Joint Undertaking.
In accordance with the principles of transparency and non-discrimination, calls for proposals organised by the FCH 2 Joint Undertaking shall
be published on the web-based Horizon 2020 Participant Portal.
Duty to divulge information: the report contains a new provision stating that Members of the staff of the Joint Undertaking, the Executive
Director, and members of the Governing Board shall, without delay, report such fraud as might have come to their knowledge in the
performance of their duties or office in OLAF provided that this disclosure does not render them liable to prosecution.
