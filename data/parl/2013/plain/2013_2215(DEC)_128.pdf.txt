2013/2215(DEC) - 26/07/2013 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE: presentation by the Commission of the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2012, as part of
the 2012 discharge procedure.
Analysis of the accounts of the European Medicines Agency (EMEA).
CONTENT: this Commission document sets out the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2012 as
prepared on the basis of the information presented by the institutions, organisations and bodies of the EU, in accordance with Article 129 (2) of
the Financial Regulation applicable to the EU's General Budget, including the European Medicines Agency (EMEA).
In 2012, the tasks and budget of this agency were as follows:

·

description of the Agency's tasks: the European Medicines Agency, which is located in London, was created by Council Regulation
(EEC) No 2309/93, which was replaced by Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council and its role
is the coordination of the scientific resources made available by the national authorities in order to ensure the evaluation and
supervision of medicinal products for human or veterinary use on the basis of a centralised procedure;

·

the Agency's budget for the 2012 financial year: the Agencys budget for 2012, as presented in the Commission document on the
consolidated annual accounts of the European Union, gives the following figures:
§

Commitment appropriations:
- committed : EUR 226 million;
- paid : EUR 222 million;
- carried over : 0.

§

Payment appropriations:
- committed : EUR 262 million;
- paid : EUR 215 million;
- carried over : EUR 41 million.

See also the final accounts of the EMA.

2013/2215(DEC) - 10/09/2013 Court of Auditors: opinion, report

PURPOSE: presentation of the EU Court of Auditors report on the annual accounts of the European Medicines Agency for the financial year
2012, together with the Agencys reply.
CONTENT: in accordance with the tasks conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court
presents to the European Parliament and to the Council, in the context of the discharge procedure, a Statement of Assurance as to the
reliability of the annual accounts of each institution, body or agency of the EU, and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying
them, on the basis of an independent external audit.
This audit concerned, amongst others, the annual accounts of the European Medicines Agency (EMA).
In the Courts opinion, the Agencys Annual Accounts fairly present, in all material respects, its financial position as of 31 December 2012 and
the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions of its financial rules and the
accounting rules adopted by the Commissions accounting officer.
The Court also considers that the transactions underlying the annual accounts of the Agency for the financial year ended 31 December 2010
are, in all material respects, legal and regular.
The report confirms that resources made available to the Agencys in 2012 amounted to EUR 222.5 million.
The report also makes a series of observations on the budgetary and financial management of the Agency, accompanied by the latters
response. The main observations may be summarised as follows:
The Courts observations:
reliability of the accounts: the Agency noted that it applies differing recognition criteria for fee revenue and associated expenditure.
This is in contradiction with the matching principle. It states that it has not yet validated its accounting system in the area of intangible
fixed assets. Given the considerable investment in the ICT development (2012 investments in ICT development amounted to EUR
11.6 million), this is a crucial part of the whole accounting system;
staff: in 2011 and 2012, the Council refused salary increases for EU staff. The Commission appealed this decision to the Court of
Justice which did not yet rule on the matter. Since the Agency is located in London, the salary increases in question will be paid in
GBP whereas the Agencys accounts are prepared in Euros. Given the fluctuations in the exchange rate over the period concerned,
the possible back pay to staff would lead to an estimated exchange rate loss for the Agency of EUR 2.09 million. The Agency has
included this amount in the calculation of its budgetary outturn account, leading to an equivalent understatement of funds to be paid
back to the Commission;
legality of the operations: in 2012, the Agency issued cascading framework contracts for the provision of services. The procurement
procedure presented some irregularities affecting the principle of transparency;
budgetary management: the rate of committed appropriations carried over was high at 27 %, this primarily relates to the Agencys
planned move to new premises in 2014 (EUR 4 million) and the development of ICT systems (EUR 1.6 million).
The Agencys response:
reliability of the accounts: in light of the Courts observation the Agency will review its accounting policy on recognising fee revenue
and associated expenditure to ensure future compliance with the matching principle;
staff: the Agency states that the amount was included in the Agency's accounts following an instruction from the Accounting Officer of
the EU Commission that all unrealised exchange losses should be included in the budgetary accounts as well as the financial
accounts. The Agency expects to need this money in order to cover the salaries payable in GBP to EMA staff when the 2011 and
2012 rappels are adopted. The Agency is aware that DG BUDG considers the rappel an unforeseeable expenditure, but judges this
position to be untenable because the adaptation of exchange rates and weightings which are part of any rappel is not only
foreseeable, but legally required and long overdue. For the budgetary accounts the Agency applies the same methodology used to
calculate the provision in the financial accounts. The Agency's primary concern is that if these figures are not included in the 2012
budgetary accounts it will find itself returning funds to the Commission when in fact those funds will be needed to pay salary liabilities
once the weighting and applicable exchange rates are adapted to real levels;
legality of operations: the Agency does not share the view of the Court that the principle of transparency was infringed in its tender
procedure. It stated that it will make improvements on the issues highlighted by the Court to ensure even greater transparency in the
future;
budgetary implementation: the Agency noted that it has already substantially reduced its carry over levels as the equivalent carry over
in 2011 was 33% and 36% in 2010 (27% in 2012). The Agency strives by respecting its operational requirements to further reduce its
carry over to a level within tolerable margins of the Financial Regulation.
Lastly, the Court of Auditors report contains a summary of the Agencys activities in 2012. This is focused on the following:
applications for marketing authorisations for 96 medicines for human use ;
pharmacovigilance activities;
mutual recognition procedures and decentralised procedures: started 6991; (ended 6709);
scientific advice finalised;
applications for paediatric investigation plans: 178 relating to 218 indications;
applications for marketing authorisations for 13 medicinal products for veterinary use;
450 inspections;
herbal medicinal product studies;
197 applications for orphan medicinal products (139 favourable opinions);
requests for SME status: 684 requests and 361 applications for fee reduction or deferrals.

2013/2215(DEC) - 21/03/2014 Committee report tabled for plenary, single reading
The Committee on Budgetary Control adopted the report by Petri SARVAMAA (EPP, FI) in which it recommended the European Parliament to
grant discharge to the Executive Director of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in respect of the implementation of the Agency's budget
for the financial year 2012.

Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the Agency for the financial
year 2012 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Members approved the closure of the Agencys accounts.
They made, however, a number of recommendations that needed to be taken into account when the discharge is granted, in addition to the
general recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies.
Reliability of the accounts - legality and regularity of transactions: Members noted that the Agency applies differing recognition criteria
for fee revenues and associated expenditure and that the revenue from application fees is recognised on a straight-line basis over a
set time period. They also regretted that the Agency has not yet validated its accounting system in the area of intangible fixed assets,
which, given the considerable investment in the development of information and communications technology (ICT), is a crucial part of
the whole accounting system. They called on the Agency to inform the discharge authority on progress in this regard within the
framework of the 2012 discharge follow-up. Members also noted with concern that in order to cover higher school fees, the Agency
grants staff whose children attend primary or secondary school a top-up allowance, which amounted to some EUR 389 000 in 2012,
allowances that may be considered irregular. They acknowledged that this situation is due to the lack of European Schools in the city
where the Agency is based.
Budget and financial management: Members noted that the rate of committed appropriations carried over was high for operating
expenses at 27% even though they acknowledged that this relates primarily to the Agencys planned move to a new premises in 2014
(EUR 4 million) and to the development of ICT systems (EUR 1.6 million).
Commitments and carryovers: Members took note that the reduced amount carried over to 2013 in comparison with 2010 and 2011
and stated that this is partly related to the new building project. They reminded the Agency of the importance of respecting the
budgetary principle of annuality.
Members also made a series of observations on transfers, procurement and recruitment procedures as well as comments on internal controls.
Lastly, they acknowledged that the Agency revised its policy on the handling of conflicts of interests by the Scientific Committees' members
and experts which is expected for endorsement by the Management Board in March 2014. They called on it to present that revised policy to
the discharge authority once adopted. Members noted that the Agency works together closely with a variety of patient, healthcare and
consumer organisations in order to take their opinions into account. They called on the Agency to request public disclosure regarding the
funding of any patient, consumer and healthcare organisation it works with, and to carry out a conflict of interests check regarding those
organisations.

2013/2215(DEC) - 03/04/2014 Final act
PURPOSE: to grant discharge to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the financial year 2012.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Decision 2014/591/EU of the European Parliament on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of
the European Medicines Agency for the financial year 2012.
CONTENT: with this Decision, the European Parliament gives discharge to the Executive Director of the European Medicines Agency for the
implementation of the Agencys budget for 2012.
The Decision is consistent with the European Parliaments resolution adopted on 3 April 2014 and includes a series of observations that form
an integral part of the discharge decision (refer to the summary of the opinion of 3 April 2014).
Amongst the main observations made, Parliament highlighted the failures as regards the legality and regularity of operations, without calling
into question its overall management.

2013/2215(DEC) - 03/04/2014 Text adopted by Parliament, single reading
The European Parliament adopted a decision concerning the discharge to be granted to the Executive Director of the European Medicines
Agency (EMA) in respect of the implementation of the Agency's budget for the financial year 2012. The vote on the discharge decision
approved the closure of the accounts (in accordance with Annex VI, Article 5(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament.
Noting that the Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the Agency for the financial
year 2012 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, Parliament adopted by 493 votes to 65, with 20 abstentions,
a resolution containing a series of recommendations that form an integral part of the discharge decision and as well as the general
recommendations that appear in the draft resolution on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies.
These recommendations are summarised as follows:
Reliability of the accounts - legality and regularity of transactions: Parliament noted that the Agency applies differing recognition
criteria for fee revenues and associated expenditure and that the revenue from application fees is recognised on a straight-line basis
over a set time period. It also regretted that the Agency has not yet validated its accounting system in the area of intangible fixed
assets, which, given the considerable investment in the development of information and communications technology (ICT), is a crucial
part of the whole accounting system. It called on the Agency to inform the discharge authority on progress in this regard within the
framework of the 2012 discharge follow-up. Parliament also noted with concern that in order to cover higher school fees, the Agency
grants staff whose children attend primary or secondary school a top-up allowance, which amounted to some EUR 389 000 in 2012,
allowances that may be considered irregular. They acknowledged that this situation is due to the lack of European Schools in the city
where the Agency is based.
Budget and financial management: Parliament noted that the rate of committed appropriations carried over was high for operating
expenses at 27% even though it acknowledged that this relates primarily to the Agencys planned move to a new premises in 2014
(EUR 4 million) and to the development of ICT systems (EUR 1.6 million).
Commitments and carryovers: Parliament took note that the reduced amount carried over to 2013 in comparison with 2010 and 2011
and stated that this is partly related to the new building project. They reminded the Agency of the importance of respecting the
budgetary principle of annuality.

Prevention and management of conflicts of interests and transparency: Parliament welcomed the fact that for the second year in a
row, the Agency held a public workshop on conflicts of interests, aimed at defining the right balance between ensuring the impartiality
and independence of experts involved in the Agency's work and securing the best possible scientific expertise. It stated that the
Agency revised its policy on the handling of conflicts of interests by the Scientific Committees' members and experts which is expected
for endorsement by the Management Board in March 2014. It called on the Agency to present that revised policy to the discharge
authority once adopted. Parliament also noted that the Agency works together closely with a variety of patient, healthcare and
consumer organisations in order to take their opinions into account; calls on the Agency to request public disclosure regarding the
funding of any patient, consumer and healthcare organisation it works with, and to carry out a conflict of interests check regarding
those organisations.
Performance: Parliament requested that the Agency communicate the results and impact its work has on European citizens in an
accessible way, mainly through its website.
Members also made a series of observations on transfers, procurement and recruitment procedures as well as comments on internal controls.
