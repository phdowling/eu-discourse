Summary

The European Parliament adopted a resolution on nuclear threats and human rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
The resolution was tabled by the ALDE, EPP, ECR, S&D, GUE/NGL and Greens/EFA groups.
Parliament recalls the DPRK's launch of 12 December 2012, which used ballistic missile technology, and the nuclear test conducted on 12
February 2013.
Nuclear threats: Members condemn the nuclear tests and missile activities as well as the DPRKs official announcement that the country
reserves its right to carry out a pre-emptive nuclear strike. They urge it to refrain from further provocative actions and sign and ratify the
Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and to rejoin the Non-Proliferation Treaty without delay.
They welcome the further strengthening of sanctions by the Council and the UN Security Council vote of 7 March 2013 following the most
recent nuclear test. Parliament affirms its desire for a diplomatic and political solution to the DPRK nuclear issue, calling on the DPRK to
re-engage constructively with the members of the Six-Party Talks, in order to work towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula. China, in
particular, is asked to exert its influence over the DPRK to ensure that the situation does not escalate further.
Human rights: Parliament expresses its deepest concern over the deteriorating human rights situation in the DPRK, which has been described
by UN Special Rapporteurs for North Korea as being in a category of its own, as egregious, widespread and systematic, and as possibly
amounting to crimes against humanity.
Expressing particular concern about the severity of the food situation the country is facing, Members call on the Commission to maintain
existing humanitarian aid programmes and channels of communication with the DPRK, and to secure their safe delivery to the targeted parts
of the population.
Calling on the DPRK to engage in a meaningful dialogue on human rights with the European Union, Members want the government to declare
a moratorium on all executions, to put an end to extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances, to release political prisoners and to allow
its citizens to travel freely.
