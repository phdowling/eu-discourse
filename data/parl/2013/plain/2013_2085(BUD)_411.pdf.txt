2013/2085(BUD) - 02/05/2013 Non-legislative basic document
PURPOSE : to mobilise the European Union Solidarity Fund to assist Slovenia, Croatia and Austria hit by flooding in 2012.
PROPOSED ACT : Decision of the European and of Council.
CONTENT : the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 allows for the mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund, within an
annual ceiling of EUR 1 billion, over and above the relevant headings of the financial framework. The conditions of eligibility to the Fund are
detailed in Council Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002.
On the basis of the applications for assistance from the Fund by Slovenia, Croatia and Austria, in relation to a flooding in autumn 2012, the
calculation of Solidarity Fund aid based on the estimate of total damage caused is as follows:
Direct damage Slovenia : EUR 359 534 838 ;
Direct damage Croatia : EUR 11 463 479 ;
Direct damage Austria : EUR 9 600 000.
Aid proposed : Slovenia : EUR 14 081 355 ; Croatia : EUR 286 587 ; Austria : EUR 240 000.
Total : EUR 14 607 942.
In the light of the examination of the applications, and considering the maximum possible grant from the Fund as well as the scope for
reallocating appropriations under the heading requiring additional expenditure, the Commission proposes to mobilise the European Union
Solidarity Fund for a total amount of EUR 14 607 942, to be allocated under heading 3b of the financial framework.
By presenting this proposal to deploy the Fund, the Commission initiates the simplified trilogue procedure, as required by Point 26 of the
Inter-institutional Agreement of 17 May 2006, in view of securing the agreement of the two arms of the Budgetary Authority on the need to use
the Fund and the amount required. The Commission invites each arm of the budgetary authority to inform the other arm and the Commission
of its intentions. In case of disagreement by either of the two arms of the Budgetary Authority, a formal trilogue meeting will be convened.
The Commission will present a draft amending budget (DAB) in order to enter in the 2013 budget specific commitment and payment
appropriations, as requested in Point 26 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006.

2013/2085(BUD) - 06/09/2013 Budgetary report tabled for plenary, 1st reading
The Committee on Budgets adopted the report by José Manuel FERNANDES (EPP, PT) on the proposal for a decision of the European

management.
The draft decision aims to mobilise the European Union Solidarity Fund for an amount of EUR 14 607 942 to assist Slovenia, Croatia and
Austria hit by flooding in 2012.

An amending budget will be adopted in parallel in order to enter in the 2013 budget specific commitment and payment appropriations to the
Unions budget (see 2013/2086(BUD).
