2013/0021(NLE) - 30/06/2015 Legislative proposal
PURPOSE: to subject 4-methylamphetamine to control measures.
PROPOSED ACT: Implementing Council Decision.
ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to
follow its opinion.
BACKGROUND: in compliance with Council Decision 2005/387/JHA on the information exchange, risk-assessment and control of new
psychoactive substances, the Scientific Committee of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) assessed the
risks on the new psychoactive substance 4-methylamphetamine. The risk assessment report was subsequently submitted to the Commission
and to the Council on 29 November 2012.
4-methylamphetamine is a synthetic ring-methylated derivative of amphetamine. It has emerged on the illicit amphetamine market where it is
sold and used as the controlled drug, amphetamine.
There has been one report of the substance being detected in a commercial product sold on the internet.
According to the limited data sources available, the acute toxicity of 4-methylamphetamine is similar to that of other stimulants. There have
been a total of 21 fatalities registered in four Member States where 4-methylamphetamine alone, or in combination with one or more
substances, especially amphetamine, has been detected in post-mortem samples.
4-methylamphetamine has been detected in 15 Member States, while one Member State has reported the manufacture of the substance on its
territory. Eight Member States control the substance under drug control legislation. The information available suggests that
4-methylamphetamine is produced and distributed by the same organised crime groups that are involved in the manufacture and trafficking of
amphetamine.
The Risk Assessment Report reveals that there is limited scientific evidence available on the characteristics and risks of 4-methylamphetamine
and points out that further studies are required on the overall health and social risks associated with the substance.
However, the evidence available provides sufficient grounds for subjecting 4-methylamphetamine to control measures across the Union. As a
result of the health risks it poses, as documented by its detection in several reported fatalities, especially when used in combination with other
substances, of its strong resemblance in terms of appearance and effects with amphetamine, of the fact that users may unknowingly consume
the substance, and of its limited medical value or use, 4-methylamphetamine should be subjected to control measures across the Union.
CONTENT: this proposal aims to invite the Member States to subject the new psychoactive substance 4-methylamphetamine to control
measures across the Union.
Decision 2013/129/EU ceases to produce effects from the date of entry into force of this Decision, without prejudice to the obligations of the
Member States relating to the time limit for subjecting 4-methylamphetamine to control measures and criminal penalties in their national laws.
The United Kingdom shall not take part in the adoption of this Decision and is not bound by it or subject to its application.

2013/0021(NLE) - 28/09/2015 Committee report tabled for plenary, 1st reading/single reading
The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs adopted the report by Micha? BONI (EPP, PL) on the draft Council implementing
decision on subjecting 4methylamphetamine to control measures.

The committee approved the Council draft which seeks to invite the Member States to subject the new psychoactive substance
4-methylamphetamine to control measures across the Union.
In compliance with Council Decision 2005/387/JHA on the information exchange, risk-assessment and control of new psychoactive
substances, the Scientific Committee of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) assessed the risks on the
new psychoactive substance 4-methylamphetamine. The risk assessment report was subsequently submitted to the Commission and to the
Council on 29 November 2012.

2013/0021(NLE) - 06/10/2015 Text adopted by Parliament, 1st reading/single reading
The European Parliament adopted by 649 votes to 6, with 34 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the draft Council implementing decision
on subjecting 4-methylamphetamine to control measures.
In line with the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, the European Parliament approved the Council draft aiming to subject
4-methylamphetamine to control measures.

2013/0021(NLE) - 08/10/2015 Final act
PURPOSE: to subject 4-methylamphetamine to control measures.
NON-LEGISLATIVE ACT: Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1874 on subjecting 4-methylamphetamine to control measures.
CONTENT: the Council adopted an implementing decision on subjecting 4-methylamphetamine to control measures across the Union.
4-methylamphetamine is a synthetic ring-methylated derivative of amphetamine. It has emerged on the illicit amphetamine market where it is
sold and used as the controlled drug, amphetamine.
Decision 2005/387/JHA confers upon the Council implementing powers with a view to giving a quick and expertise-based response at Union
level to the emergence of new psychoactive substances detected and reported by the Member States, by subjecting those substances to
control measures across the Union.
A risk assessment report on 4-methylamphetamine was drawn up in accordance with Decision 2005/387/JHA by a special session of the
extended Scientific Committee of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA).
The report revealed that there is limited scientific evidence available on the characteristics and risks of 4-methylamphetamine and points out
that further studies are required on the overall health and social risks associated with the substance. However, the evidence available provides
sufficient grounds for subjecting 4-methylamphetamine to control measures across the Union.
Decision 2013/129/EU ceases to produce effects as of the day of entry into force of this Decision, without prejudice to the obligations of the
Member States relating to the time limit for subjecting that new psychoactive substance to control measures and criminal penalties in their
national laws.
ENTRY INTO FORCE: 21.10.2015.
