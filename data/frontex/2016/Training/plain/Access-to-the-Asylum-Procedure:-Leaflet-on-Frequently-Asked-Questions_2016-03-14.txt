Access to the Asylum Procedure

1

What is international
protection?
People in need of international protection do not
have basic human rights and physical security
guaranteed in their home countries and they have
been forced to escape from the risk of persecution,
inhuman or degrading treatment or other serious
human rights violations. Therefore, the international
community needs to step in and fulfil its obligation
under international and EU law to grant international
protection to those who lack protection in their
home countries.
The EU asylum acquis provides for two forms of
international protection: refugee status and
subsidiary protection status. Based on the principle
of a uniform status for refugees or for persons eligible
for subsidiary protection, beneficiaries of subsidiary
protection status should be granted the same rights
and benefits as those enjoyed by refugees and should
be subject to the same conditions of eligibility. In
addition, your state may also provide for other forms
of protection, based on humanitarian grounds.
Access to safety and adequate asylum procedure
is an essential element to ensure that persons in
need of international protection enjoy the rights
to which they are entitled. As a first-contact
official, you play a crucial role in ensuring access to
protection for persons in need.

1

2

What is non-refoulement
and who does it apply to?

Non-refoulement refers to the obligation of Member
States to refrain from expelling or returning
any individual in any manner to the frontiers of
territories or to any place where they may face
persecution, the death penalty, torture or other
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,
even if they are in an irregular migratory situation. In
the asylum context, the principle of non-refoulement
entails a requirement to grant individuals seeking
international protection access to the territory and
to fair and efficient asylum procedures to determine if
the person shall be granted international protection
or not.
The prohibition of refoulement is applicable to any
form of forcible removal, including deportation,
expulsion, extradition, informal transfer or
‘renditions’, and non-admission at the border. This
includes also indirect refoulement, which is the
return of a person to a third country where the
risk of refoulement exists. No asylum seeker should
be returned to a third country for determination of
the claim without sufficient guarantees, in each
individual case. These guarantees include that the
person will be readmitted to that country, will enjoy
effective protection against refoulement, will have
the possibility to seek and enjoy asylum and will be
treated in accordance with accepted international
standards.
See Section “‘Key role of first-contact officials”
of the Practical Guide.

3

Who shall be granted
international
protection in the EU?

EU asylum acquis provides for two forms of
international protection: refugee status and
subsidiary protection status. In addition, your
state may also provide for other forms of protection,
based on humanitarian grounds.
•

A refugee is a person who was forced to flee
the country of nationality, or in the case of
stateless persons the country of former habitual
residence, because of a well-founded fear of
being persecuted for reasons of race, religion,
nationality, political opinion or membership of
a particular social group, and is unable or, owing
to such fear, unwilling to return to it.

•

Subsidiary protection is granted to people
who do not qualify as refugees, but are still in
need of international protection. Across the EU,
subsidiary protection is provided to those facing
a real risk of serious harm if returned to their
country. Serious harm consists of:
•

the death penalty or execution

•

torture, inhuman or degrading treatment
or punishment

•

serious and individual threat by reason of
indiscriminate violence in situations of
international or internal armed conflict.

As a first-contact official, your responsibilities include
the proper identification and referral of persons who
may be in need of international protection as well as
other persons with special needs, including children
and victims of human trafficking. Sometimes people

3

may have multiple needs and multiple referrals may
be necessary.
Remember that when you come into contact
with persons who may be in need of international
protection, you are representing not only your
country, but also the EU as a whole.

What is the Common European
Asylum System?
The Common European Asylum System (CEAS) is
a common system based on the full and inclusive
application of the Geneva Convention. It aims to
ensure fair and human treatment of applicants
for international protection, to harmonise asylum
systems and to reduce the differences between
Member States on the basis of binding legislation, as
well as to strengthen practical cooperation between
national asylum administrations and the external
dimension of asylum.
The CEAS is composed of the following legal
instruments, setting out common high standards
and stronger cooperation to ensure that applicants
for international protection are treated equally in an
fair and efficient system — wherever they apply for
international protection:
The recast Asylum Procedures Directive that aims at
fair, quick and good quality asylum decisions.
The recast Reception Conditions Directive that
ensures that there are humane material reception
conditions for asylum seekers across the EU and that
the fundamental rights of the concerned persons are
fully respected.
The recast Qualification Directive that clarifies the
grounds for granting international protection. Its
provisions also foresee a series of rights and integration
measures for beneficiaries of international protection.
The recast Dublin Regulation clarifying the process
of establishing the Member State responsible for
examining the application.
The recast Eurodac Regulation improving the
functioning of the EU asylum fingerprint database.

What is the difference
between a migrant
and a person in need
of international
protection?

“Migrant” is a wide-ranging term that covers persons
who leave one country or region to settle in another.
Some migrants voluntarily decide to move for a
variety of reasons, most of them for reasons that
are not protection-related, for instance because of
family ties or due to economic hardship. Persons in
need of international protection, however, are
forced to flee to save their lives or preserve their
freedom. They have no protection in their country of
origin; in fact it is often their own government that
is threatening to persecute them. If other countries
do not let them in, and do not offer protection, they
may be leaving them exposed to death, persecution
or other serious human rights violations.
Modern migratory patterns are often mixed.
Within mixed migration flows, those who are
in need of protection and those whose reasons
are not protection-related travel alongside each
other, making use of the same routes and means
of transport. Such journeys may be long, hard and
dangerous, often organised in an irregular manner.
Identifying those who may wish to apply for
international protection under those circumstances
is a challenging but extremely important task.

5

5

Is it my duty to decide
whether a person is in
need of international
protection?

No. It is not your responsibility to assess whether
a person is in need of international protection or
if his/her account is credible. A different procedure
will follow at a different place, conducted by officials
of the asylum determination authority, to assess
the application and determine, in accordance with
EU and international law, if the person qualifies for
international protection or not.
Your duty is to identify persons that may wish to
apply for international protection, provide them
with information on the possibility to do so and refer
to the competent authority those who expressed the
wish to apply.
See Section “Key role of first-contact officials”
of the Practical Guide.

6

6

What rights do persons
who may be in need of
international protection
have when I come into
contact with them?

Persons who may be in need of international
protection are entitled to certain rights
regardless of whether they have explicitly
applied for international protection or not. In
many instances, it will be your duty to ensure that
these rights are guaranteed.
As such, the principle of non-refoulement applies to all
persons regardless of whether their status has or has
not been formally determined. Member States have
the obligation to refrain from returning individuals to
any place where they may face persecution as well as
inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment,
including torture, even if they are in an irregular
migratory situation.
Other rights include effective access to asylum
procedure, the right to information in a language
he/she can understand about the possibility to
apply, including access to an interpreter, and the
opportunity to communicate with UNHCR or
other organisations providing legal advice or
counselling to applicants.
Remember that all persons must be treated with full
respect for human dignity and in accordance with
fundamental and human rights, including provision
of emergency healthcare and meeting basic needs.
Vulnerable persons, including children and victims of
trafficking in human beings, must be identified and
referred to appropriate procedures.
See Section “Key role of first-contact officials”
of the Practical Guide.

7

7

What is my
responsibility towards
vulnerable persons?

Vulnerable persons include especially children,
unaccompanied children, disabled people, elderly
people, pregnant women, single parents with
children, victims of human trafficking, persons with
serious illness or mental disorders and persons who
have been subjected to torture, rape or other serious
forms of psychological, physical or sexual violence.
Border-crossing points and detention facilities are
among the primary locations where the special needs
of vulnerable persons may be declared or detected.
As a frontline official, you have the responsibility
to identify the special needs of vulnerable
persons and refer them for further assessment
and/or support to national authorities and other
stakeholders, such as NGOs and UNHCR, which are
specialised and mandated to respond to their needs
in accordance with national legislation and practice.
Make sure you are aware of the national referral
procedures and have the relevant contact details at
hand.
Emergency health considerations and basic needs
should always be addressed immediately and should
take priority over migratory concerns. Family unity
should be preserved to the extent possible and
children should not be separated from their parents
or relatives.
See Section “Pay attention to vulnerabilities”
of the Practical Guide.

8

8

What is my
responsibility towards
a child or a person who
claims to be a child?

In line with the relevant international and European
legal standards and legislation, a child is any human
being below the age of 18 years unless, under
the law applicable to the child, majority is attained
earlier. Even if you are not sure if the person who
claims so is really a child, he/she still must be referred
to the responsible authority for age assessment in
accordance with national legislation and practice.
Children are inherently vulnerable and it is very
important to be particularly sensitive to their
special needs, especially in the case they are
unaccompanied or separated. Unaccompanied
and separated children should be identified and
referred to the responsible authorities as quickly
as possible according to national legislation and
practice and in line with the guarantees provided
by EU law. Make sure you are aware of the national
referral procedures and have the contact details
of specialised child protection services and other
responsible stakeholders at hand.
Always remain observant and pay attention
to possible indications of trafficking. Is there
anything unusual about the situation you see? Is the
child quiet, detached/distant, incoherent, scared,
upset? Is a person waiting for the child or is the child
looking at another adult? At any time, if there is a
reasonable suspicion that the child may be at risk
of trafficking, or is otherwise in need of protection,
the referral mechanism and initial investigation
must apply immediately according to the national
legislation and practice.

9

Remember to communicate in a child-friendly
manner, taking into account the age and maturity
of the child. Keep him/her informed of what is
happening and what is going to happen. Ensure
access to basic services.
The best interests of the child must be a primary
consideration in all actions and decisions
concerning the child. As a general rule, children
should not be separated from their accompanying
parents or relatives, unless there is reasonable
suspicion that it is not in their best interests. In such
case, specialised child protection services should
be informed immediately according to the national
legislation and practice.
The principle of non-refoulement shall be applied. If the
return applies, the safeguards for children stipulated
in Article 10 of the Return Directive shall be observed.
See Section “Unaccompanied or separated children”
of the Practical Guide.
For further information, consult the Frontex
Vega Children Handbook(1).

Children_Handbook.pdf

9

Could a victim of
human trafficking
also be in need
of international
protection?

If there are reasons to believe that a person may
be a victim of human trafficking, he/she should be
referred to the responsible authorities and services
according to national legislation and practice for
relevant assistance and support. Make sure you are
aware of the national referral procedures for victims
of human trafficking and have the relevant contact
details at hand.
However, in some cases, victims of human
trafficking may also be in need of international
protection and shall be given access to the
asylum procedure. In any case, all victims of human
trafficking should be properly informed of their right
to seek asylum.
Be aware that the trafficker may still be around. It
is important that everyone has the opportunity to
speak with you on their own behalf, freely and in
private. Make sure that nobody intervenes and/or
answers questions on behalf of other person apart
from when acting in his/her best interests. Particular
attention to possible indications of trafficking should
be given in case of unaccompanied or separated
children.
In the case of women and girls, the presence of a
female first-contact official should be ensured, if
possible. Women and girls should not be urged to
talk about incidents or crimes related to sexual

11

exploitation or violence. If appropriate, considering
their age, women should be sensitively asked if they
might be pregnant and, if needed, be informed about
available assistance.
See Section “Persons with multiple protection
needs” of the Practical Guide.

12

10

Who can apply
for international
protection?

Everyone has the right to apply for international
protection.
The right to asylum is recognised in the Geneva
Convention, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of
the EU, and other international and European legal
instruments. However, this does not mean that every
person who applies for international protection will
receive it. In every asylum system, some applications
will be rejected and some accepted, but all of them
must be assessed in accordance with European and
international law.
Access to safety and adequate procedures is an
essential element of the effective enjoyment of the
right to asylum. As a first-contact official, you have
a crucial role in identifying those who may wish to
apply for international protection and ensuring their
access to asylum procedure.
See Section “Who may wish to make an
application?” of the Practical Guide.

13

11

Can a person with
fraudulent documents
or without documents
at all also apply
for international
protection?

Yes. Everybody has the right to apply for
international protection regardless of whether
he/she entered the Member State or is present
on its territory illegally, using false or fraudulent
documents or without any documentation at all.
Most persons in need of international protection
are confronted with life-threatening situations of
violence, which rarely give them the opportunity to
gather the requisite documentation to be granted
access to the EU through legal channels.
In accordance with the Geneva Convention and the
Schengen Border Code, applicants for international
protection cannot be penalised on account of their
illegal entry or presence, provided they present
themselves without delay to the authorities. Even
during the investigation of false and fraudulent
documents, the person may apply for international
protection. In this case, the police investigation
shall be stopped and the asylum procedure shall be
initiated.
See Section “Who may wish to make an
application?” of the Practical Guide.

14

12

How do I recognise
that someone
may wish to apply
for international
protection?

Many persons who may be in need of international
protection do not actively apply for asylum in the
country in which they arrive. Many of them may not
know their rights and obligations or may choose
not to ask for protection because of their specific
situation or because of being misinformed by others,
including smugglers, about their options.
Therefore it is important to observe and pay
attention to indications that a person may wish
to apply for international protection.
Indications that a person may wish to apply for
international protection may be revealed in different
ways. You may observe them, ascertain them
through direct contact with the person or with
other persons, deduce them from the documents
the person presents and/or come across them
under other circumstances. In order to detect
the indications quicker and more precisely, pay
particular attention to the following elements:
1.	Who the person is (age; gender; family
status; ethnicity, religion and nationality)
2.	Where the person comes from (country of
origin; general circumstances of arrival)

15

3.	What the person says/fears:






Being killed or executed
Persecution
Torture
War
Return

4.	What the person wants:




Help
Protection
To see a representative of UN/UNHCR/a
lawyer

5.	What can you observe (appearance and
behaviour):





Approaching/avoiding the officer
Fear, stress or unusual silence
Unusual behaviour and/or attitude
Appearance (injuries, scars, clothing,
belongings, etc.)

Provision of information is a key element in ensuring
effective access to the asylum procedure. As a firstcontact official, your role is to make sure that people
who may wish to apply for international protection
are able to do so. Therefore you need to proactively
provide them with information on the right to apply
for asylum, including on the rights and obligations it
triggers.
See Section “Non-exhaustive list of indications”
of the Practical Guide.

16

13

When and how
should I provide
information to
people who may
wish to apply
for international
protection?

As a first-contact official, your role is to make sure
that people who may wish to apply for international
protection are able to do so. Therefore you need to
proactively provide them with information on the
right to apply for asylum, including on the rights and
obligations it triggers. The main purpose of providing
information is to ensure that persons who may be
in need of international protection have effective
access to the asylum procedure.
In general, information on the possibility to apply
for international protection must be provided in
detention facilities and at border-crossing points,
including transit zones, at external borders. However,
it can be understood as a good practice that such
information is provided also at the moment where
people trying to circumvent the border-crossing
points are stopped by the authorities responsible for
border surveillance.
Make sure that you are aware of the information
to be provided based on national legislation and
practice and in accordance with EU law. The
information should be provided in a timely manner
and should be as complete as possible. It is necessary
to communicate in a language understood by the

17

person. If needed, interpretation should be ensured.
Language and communication should be
adapted to the gender, age, physical and mental
state and/or education level of the person in
front of you. In the case of women and girls, the
presence of a female first-contact official and female
interpreter should be ensured, if possible.
See Section “Non-exhaustive list of indications”
of the Practical Guide.

18

14

When does someone
become an applicant
for international
protection?

A person becomes an applicant for international
protection when he/she has made an
application. Under the EU asylum acquis, a person
is considered to make an application when he/
she expresses, in whatever form and to any
authority, the wish to apply for international
protection, or when he/she can be understood to be
seeking international protection. It is not necessary
to use the exact word ‘asylum’ or ‘refugee’. Applicants
for international protection shall be granted all the
rights and obligations attached to this status.
As a first-contact official, you are often the first
representative of your country with whom a person
who may be in need of international protection
comes into contact. In many cases, such persons
will have, for the first time, the chance to express the
wish to apply for international protection to you.
Remember that many persons who may be in need
of international protection fear persecution from
officials in their own country or have been ill-treated
by officials in other countries during their journey.
In many cases they may not approach you directly
or actively apply for asylum. First-contact officials
play a key role in creating an atmosphere of
trust and proactively identifying persons who
may wish to apply for international protection,
providing them with relevant information on
the right to apply for asylum and referring them
to appropriate procedures.
See Section “What to do next if a person
applies for international protection”
of the Practical Guide.

19

15

How do I recognise
that a person
is asking for
international
protection?

As a first-contact official, you will often be the first
representative of your country with whom thirdcountry nationals reaching the EU come into contact
and to whom they have for the first time the chance
to express their wish to apply for asylum.
Be aware that people may express an intention to
apply for international protection in a variety of ways.
Any expression of fear of persecution or serious
harm if refused entry, expressed either verbally
or in writing, qualifies as such a request. It is not
necessary to use the exact word ‘asylum’ or ‘refugee’.
Some of the key words, expressions or messages
that may signal that a person may wish to apply
for international protection include fear of being
killed, persecution, torture, war and/or fear of
being returned. The person may also ask for help,
protection or may want to see the UN, UNHCR
office or a lawyer, etc.
Any person who has expressed the wish to
apply for international protection becomes an
applicant with all the rights and obligations
attached to this status and must be referred to
the responsible authorities for further assessment.
Remember that your judgement at the point of entry
has crucial and critical importance. Consult your
superior whenever you have any doubts about the
intentions of the person in front of you.
See Section “Recognise making of the
application for international protection”
of the Practical Guide.

20

16

What should I do
if a person has
expressed the
wish to apply
for international
protection to me?

As soon as a person has expressed the wish to apply
for international protection, he/she becomes
an applicant and must be referred to the
responsible authorities for further assessment. As
an officer of the authority, which is likely to receive
applications for international protection, you have
the duty to inform the applicant as to where and
how the application should be lodged.
Applicants for international protection are
entitled to certain rights and guarantees
attached to this status, including the right to remain,
the right to basic material reception conditions,
adequate support in case of special procedural
and/or reception needs, the right to receive more
detailed information on the asylum procedure in
the language they understand and guarantees in
case of detention. As a first-contact official, you are
responsible for helping to ensure these rights are
maintained, for example by referring the applicants
to the relevant authorities and organisations.
After an application has been made, it must be
registered.
•

21

If you work for an authority with the
competence to register the application, you
are required to do so within three working
days.

•

If you work for another authority, you should
refer the application to the competent
authority so that it is registered no later
than six working days after the application was
made. It is recommended to keep a written
record that you have received the application,
in accordance with your national legislation and
practice.

Remember that applicants for international
protection must not be penalised on account
of their illegal entry or presence, provided they
present themselves without delay to the authorities.
See Section “What to do next if a person
applies for international protection”
of the Practical Guide.

22

17

What should I do if
there are indications
that someone may be
in need of protection,
but he/she has not
expressed the wish to
apply?

Many persons who may be in need of international
protection do not actively apply for asylum. For
example, they may not know of the right or the
procedures to do so, may be victims of trafficking
or may suffer trauma related to persecution or
the difficult journey. In addition, persons in need
of international protection often lack information
about their rights and obligations, have relatives in
other Member States whom they hope to join, or have
been misinformed by others, including smugglers,
about their options. It is unrealistic to expect them to
have complex knowledge of the asylum and Dublin
procedures, full trust in authorities to directly raise
their fear at borders or in detention, or to know the
right words and expressions that could grant them
access to the procedure.
Provision of information is a key element in
ensuring that persons who may be in need of
international protection have effective access
to the asylum procedure and are able to make
well-informed decisions about whether to apply for
international protection or not.
Remember that it is part of your obligation to
ensure that no person, even if they have not applied
for international protection, is returned to a place
where they may face persecution, inhumane or
degrading treatment or punishment, including

23

torture, even if they are in an irregular migratory
situation. Any returns should follow established
procedures, including the required legal safeguards
and guarantees.
Consult your superior whenever you have any doubts
about the intentions of the person in front of you,
especially if his/her return to the country of origin
or transit would constitute a possible breach of
European or international law.
See Section “What to do next if a person who may
have protection needs does not want to apply for
international protection” of the Practical Guide.

24

18

What if a person
applied for asylum,
but I suspect he/
she is only trying to
abuse the system?

Any person who has expressed the wish to
apply for international protection becomes an
applicant with all the rights and obligations
attached to this status and must be referred
to the responsible authorities for further
assessment.
Remember that it is not your task to assess whether
a person is in need of international protection or if
his/her account is credible. It is the responsibility of
the asylum authority. In every asylum system some
applications will be rejected and some accepted,
but all of them must be assessed in accordance with
European and international law.
Nevertheless, you may wish to consult your superior
or to inform the responsible authority about the
reasons for your doubts.
See Section “Who may wish to make an
application?” of the Practical Guide.

25

19

What happens if
I fail to identify a
person wishing
to apply for
international
protection?

An incorrect identification and failure to refer the
person to the competent authorities may have
serious consequences for the person. He/she may
be returned to a country where his/her life or
freedom would be threatened or where he/
she would face persecution, death, cruel and
inhuman degrading treatment or other serious
human rights violations.
As a first-contact official you have a crucial role in
ensuring access to protection for persons in need.
Consult your superior whenever you have any doubts
about the intentions of the person in front of you.

26

20

Sometimes I feel
exhausted or even
feel angry at the
persons I have to
deal with on a daily
basis. Is this normal?

Every first-contact official needs to perform his/her
tasks under demanding circumstances, frequently
encountering people from different cultures, a
different social background and with different
life experiences. This interesting, but extremely
demanding working environment can have an impact
on your psychological well-being. In the discharge of
your duties, you may experience varied emotions,
ranging from compassion, through indifference, to
rejection of the individuals you deal with every day.
This in turn can affect the effectiveness and quality
of your work, and your ability to take appropriate
decisions and actions.
It is important to be aware of those factors as well as
of your personal circumstances and make a constant
effort to minimise their impact. If needed, don’t
hesitate to ask your colleagues or supervisors for
support or to seek professional counselling.
See Section “Be aware of your personal
circumstances” of the Practical Guide.

he/she would face a risk of persecution, the death penalty,
torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or
punishment. This rule also applies to non-admission at
the border and to any form of forcible removal.

Vulnerable persons must be identified
and adequately supported
Measures taken at border crossing points and in
detention facilities are crucial moment, where the special
needs of vulnerable persons, including children and
victims of trafficking in human beings, may be declared
or detected.

Best interests of the child take precedence
in all actions concerning children
In assessing the best interests of the child, due account,
on a case-by-case basis, must be taken regarding
factors such as safety and security, family reunification
possibilities, the child’s wellbeing and the views of the
child in accordance with his/her age and maturity.

Anyone who may wish to apply for
international protection must be
informed about their right to do so
Information on this right to asylum must be provided
to all persons who may be in need of international
protection to ensure that they have effective access to
the asylum procedure.

Everyone has the right to apply for
international protection
No one can be denied access to the asylum procedure,
even if that person did not fulfil all the entry
conditions.

Any sign or expression of fear can be
understood as a request for international
protection
People may express an intention to apply for
international protection in a variety of ways. Any
expression of fear of persecution or serious harm if
refused entry — verbally or in writing — qualifies as such
a request. It is not necessary to use the word ‘asylum’ or
‘refugee’.

Applicants for international protection
must not be penalised due to their illegal
entry or presence
Those who present themselves without delay to the
authorities must not be penalised as a result of their
illegal entry or presence.

9

Each application must be registered
or referred for registration to the
responsible authority
After an application has been made it must be
registered by the responsible authority. The registration
should be completed as soon as possible, within the
time limits prescribed by law.

10

The principle of non-refoulement must be
ensured, even when a person does not
apply for asylum
Any returns should follow established procedures,
including the required legal safeguards and guarantees.
Nobody can be returned to a country where he/she is
at risk of torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or
punishment, even if he/she is in an irregular migratory
situation.
