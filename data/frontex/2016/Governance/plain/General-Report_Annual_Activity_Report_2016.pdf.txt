Executive Summary
1.

In 2016 Frontex’ mandate was boosted with the adoption of the European Border and Coast Guard
regulation (EU) 2016/1624. Under the new mandate, the role and activities were significantly expanded
(e.g.: rapid reserve pool; return experts’ pools; vulnerability assessment; coast guard function etc.); the
permanent staff will be more than doubled and the Agency will be able to purchase its own equipment
and deploy them in border operations at short notice.
While the “European Border and Coast Guard Agency” replaces the “European Agency for the Management
of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union”, it has
the same legal personality and the same short name: Frontex.

2.

The main operational focus of Frontex in 2016 was on the Central and Eastern Mediterranean areas which
experienced the most significant migratory pressure. Considerable operational resources were also
allocated to the Western Balkan area where migrants that entered the EU in Bulgaria and Greece flowed
into (so-called secondary movements).

3.

The sea border activities of Frontex were performed under the umbrella of five joint operations Poseidon, Triton, Hera, Indalo, Minerva as well as rapid intervention - Poseidon. With a difficult situation
at the external EU borders, especially in the Central Mediterranean and Eastern Mediterranean regions,
2016 marked big increase in operational activity resulting in interception of high number of migrants
(approx.370,000) and consequently high number of persons being thoroughly screened.
2016 saw also an increased cooperation with other players in the security domain such as the cooperation
with EU NAVFOR Med Sofia in the margins of joint operation Triton and the NATO in joint operation
Poseidon.

4.

The land border activities of Frontex were performed under the umbrella of four joint operations – Focal
Points Land, Coordination Points, Flexible Operational Activity 2016 (Border Surveillance and Border
Checks).
The unstable migratory situation in 2016 lead to numerous requests from Member States for increased
support at their external land borders. To this end, Frontex coordinated activities supported, among
others, the enhancement of the operational activities at the mostly affected Bulgarian - Turkish border
with the reinforcement of border surveillance aiming at strengthened control of the migratory flows
arriving to the EU.
Throughout 2016, increased support was provided at the Bulgarian – Serbian and Greek - the Former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia borders with the aim to control the attempts of migrants for secondary
movements towards Serbia. At the same time, Hungarian – Serbian and Croatian-Serbian borders were
supported in order to ensure consistency of the enhanced operational activities in the Western Balkans
area.

5.

Frontex-coordinated joint operations at the international EU airports were performed under the umbrella
of six joint operations – Vega Children, Focal Points Air 2016 – Regular Officers, Focal Points Air 2016
Intermediate Managers and Pegasus.

6.

In 2016 Frontex assisted 232 Return Operation (+251% comparing with the operation assisted in 2015)
returning in total 10,698 people. The budget committed for joint return operations in 2016 was EUR
30,5m. Frontex started supporting Member States in the implementation of national return operations
(NROs) even before the new regulation entered into force. Both the wording and the implementation of
Art. 9 of the former Frontex regulation called for a more flexible approach in accordance with the EU
policy on return. The ED Decision 2016/36 of 23.03.2016 adopted a broader interpretation of JROs,
allowing Frontex to support more MS with NROs, not only frontline MS.
In 2016 Frontex provided a dedicated assistance to specific Member States such as Greece.

7.

The new regulation on the European Border and Coast Guard established new elements in the activities
related to pooling of resources. Frontex had to address these new needs and integrated them with the
old ones.
The first action was to revise the profiles of experts to be made available for the European Border and
Coast Guard Teams. Frontex did it in cooperation with the Member States and the European Commission.
As a result, two new profiles were created: dog handler and European coast guard functions officer.
Besides, three new expert profiles corresponding to the new tasks in the area of return activities were
developed: forced-return monitor, forced-return escort and return specialist. As a consequence, three
return pools, consisting of experts corresponding to these profiles were effectively set up.
Another important development in the area of pooling resources was the establishment of the new
mandatory rapid reaction pools for human and technical resources. The new regulation entered into force
in October, by December Member States confirmed the availability of expected 1500 experts to be placed
at the immediate disposal of Frontex for deployment in case of a rapid intervention.

9

8.

The baseline assessment, the first step of the Common Vulnerability Assessment Methodology, was
officially launched in January 2017, enabling the first assessments to be delivered in April 2017.

9.

With reference to the extended scope of the mandate on processing of personal data in the EBCG
Regulation, Frontex implements new activities on processing of personal data for risk analysis, namely (1)
process personal data on terrorists, (2) enable Frontex staff to collect personal data (3) send collected
and processed personal data back to the host Member State.
The PeDRA Pilot exercise was successfully launched and implemented in a succession of Joint Operations
in Italy, Spain and Greece, from 2 February 2016 until 31 January 2017. Personal data immediately began
to arrive in Frontex, were processed, used for risk analysis and then were transmitted to Europol.

10. Throughout 2016 Frontex has been providing tailored services for the enhanced situational picture at the
EU external borders (earth observation, maritime monitoring, and enhanced weather forecast data).
Frontex handled more than 90 requests from Member States and other partners for activation of services
such as satellite imagery over the Central and Eastern Mediterranean region. These included for example
vessel detection services (providing satellite imagery of specific sea areas) and pre-frontier monitoring
(providing imagery analysis of pre-frontier areas).
11. In 2016, approximately 110 curriculum designers and trainers from Member States and Schengen
Associated Countries were trained in course design and eight Sectoral Qualifications Framework (SQF)
trainers were recruited to support the SQF alignment process.
As a result, some of the Member States have started to review their curricula and align it with Bologna
and Copenhagen principles using SQF.
In 2016, 23 students of the European Joint Master’s in Strategic Border Management (EJMSBM) have
successfully concluded the taught component of the programme and progressed to the dissertation stage.
12. In 2016 Frontex enhanced cooperation with Interpol, IOM, UNHCR, UNODC, ICMPD and other international
actors. This year marked the start of an EU-funded technical assistance project “Regional Support to
Protection Sensitive Migration Management in the Western Balkans and Turkey” in the framework of the
Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA II) and as part of the EU accession processes of the
Programme’s beneficiary countries: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia, Kosovo*, Serbia, Montenegro and Turkey.
13. The Fundamental Rights Officer (FRO) has continued to provide advice and develop new tools serving the
purpose of promotion of fundamental rights in border management activities. In line with the new legal
framework, the Complaints Mechanism was set up.
14. In 2016, Frontex saw a slight increase in requests for access to documents (63 requests) compared with
the year 2015 (60 requests). Applications often contained several and complex sub-requests, amounting
often to a request for a very large number of documents. Overall, the Agency was requested to provide
access to 725 documents. The most common applications for access related to Serious Incident Reports
from Frontex operations. Others included requests for access to Operational Plans, Evaluation Reports
and minutes from several meetings held.
15. In 2016, Frontex’ initially adopted budget of EUR 254.0 m was amended twice resulting in the final budget
of EUR 232.8m. The number of grants issued to co-finance Frontex coordinated operations increased
significantly compared with 2015 and 2014: Frontex issued 1741 grants in 2016 compared with 1323 in
2015 (+32%) and 1073 in 2014 (+62%).
Overall, 1167 procurement procedures were carried out in the course of 2016 compared with 1137 in
2015. These procedures were implemented either by launching own tender procedures or using Framework
contracts in place concluded by the Agency or by the Commission.
16. In light of the extension of Frontex’ mandate and foreseen grow in staff members in the next four years
a first ever Human Resources Strategy was developed and adopted. The strategy serves as guidelines for
HR management in 2016-2019.
In 2016, a total of 134 new employees joined Frontex, there were 54 new posts published and eight
employees were reassigned to other tasks. At the end of 2016 Frontex reached a total of 365 staff
members, out of which 197 temporary agents, 93 contract agents and 75 seconded national experts.
17. During 2016 the audit on "Data Validation and Quality Assurance for the Risk Analysis" was completed. The
final report received on 6 September 2016 and subsequently the Action Plan was developed and sent mid
October 2016.
The provisional accounts and a reporting package were forwarded to the accounting officer of the
Commission and the Court of Auditors on 28 February 2017.
18. In February 2016 Frontex’ Management Board endorsed the Annual Evaluation Plan 2016 with the aim to
carry out four evaluations during the year. As of mid-2016 the preparation and implementation of the

10

EBCG Regulation required shifts of resources in all parts of the organization, therefore the increased
workload allowed to implement only two out of the four initially planned evaluations. (‘Evaluation of the
monitoring and risk analysis function’; ‘Evaluation of Joint Operations and Pilot Projects – Process Design’)
19. The 2016 annual review of the internal control system and organisational performance provided
reasonable assurance to Frontex management as to the level of compliance with all internal controls, on
the correct functioning of the systems in place and on organisational performance.

Introduction
In line with the new European Border and Coast Guard Regulation 1 which entered into force on 6 October 2016,
Article 68(3)(d) thereof stipulates that the Executive Director shall prepare each year the Annual Activity Report
on the Agency's activities and submit it to the Management Board. Article 62(2)(i) of the EBCG Regulation states
that the Management Board shall adopt an Annual Activity Report of the Agency for the previous year and forward
it, by 1 July at the latest, to the European Parliament, to the Council, to the Commission and to the Court of
Auditors.
The first part (Chapter 1 to 3) of the Annual Activity Report contains comprehensive, reliable and easily
understandable information regarding Frontex’ work; it outlines

developments achieved at policy and Agency level;

the situation at the external borders in the course of 2016;

the new and enhanced mandate of the Agency and

the main activities per Strategic Action Areas during 2016.
It also reports on

the cooperation with third countries,

the way how fundamental rights are promoted in the Frontex’ coordinated activities, and

the issue of public access to documents.
Finally, as stated in Article 26 and 28(8) of the EBCG Regulation, it provides a comprehensive comparative analysis
of the results of evaluations of core operation activities with a view to enhancing the quality, coherence and
effectiveness of future activities.
As stated in Article 47 of the Frontex Financial Regulation2 the authorising officer shall report to the Management
Board on the performance of his duties in a form of an Annual Activity Report and submit it for assessment. No
later than 1 July each year the report together with its assessment shall be sent by the Management Board to the
Court of Auditors, to the Commission, to the European Parliament and the Council.
The second part (Chapter 4 to 6) of the document represents such a main instrument of management accountability
and constitutes the basis on which the Executive Director as authorising officer takes his responsibility for the

management of human and financial resources by reference to the general and specific objectives set in
the work programme;

efficiency and effectiveness of the internal control systems, including an overall assessment of the costs
and benefits of controls;

accounts and the report on budgetary and financial management and

indication of the results of the operations by reference to the objectives set, risks associated.
The new EBCG Regulation came into effect as of 6 October 2016. The extended and enhance mandate drives the
need for revision of the current Mission, Vision and Values of the Agency applied during 2016. Nevertheless, the
statements outlined below reflect the former legal framework in place, while a new ‘Mission Statement 2025’ currently under development - will reflect essential changes to strategic and conceptual elements of the new
mandate.

Mission
Frontex supports, coordinates and develops European border management in line with the Treaties including the
Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU as well as other international obligations.
Frontex supports the Member States3 (MS) to achieve an efficient, high and uniform level of border control in
accordance with the relevant EU Acquis in particular the Schengen Border Code.
Frontex coordinates operational and EU measures to jointly respond to exceptional situations at the external
borders.

Frontex develops capacities at Member States and European level as combined instruments to tackle challenges
focusing of migration flows, but also contributing to fight cross border crime and terrorism at the external borders.

Vision
Frontex is the trustworthy European Border Agency, strengthening the European area of Freedom, Security and
Justice.
Frontex is supporting the Members States to keep up their responsibilities by providing operational solidarity,
especially to those facing disproportionate pressures at their external borders.
Frontex applies the concept of Integrated Border Management with a balanced focus on effective border control
and fight against cross border crime. The Agency uses effectively all means including enhanced interagency
cooperation and cooperation with Non EU and Third countries to fulfil its remit.
Frontex promotes the European border guard culture with the full respect and promotion of fundamental rights as
an integral element. Special focus is applied to the right for asylum and international protection and the principle
of non-refoulment.
Frontex builds the capacities and capabilities in the Member States aiming at developing a functioning European
System for Border Guards.
Professional staff and a set of operational and administrative capabilities enable Frontex to add value to the
European Union.
Frontex is the preferred provider of operational support and expertise on border management to Member States,
the Commission and other EU Agencies.
Values
Within a team-work focused framework, enabled by open communication, Frontex’ staff members share and live
the corporate values. Consequently, they perform their activities in a highly professional way. Humanity links
Frontex’ activities with the promotion and respect of fundamental rights as unconditional and integral component
of effective integrated border management resulting in trust in Frontex.

1. DEVELOPMENTS
1.1. The situation at the external borders in 2016
In 2016, a drop in detections reported at the external borders with Turkey and Western Balkan countries led to an
overall decrease in detections of illegal border- crossing at EU level. However, with over half a million detections
(511 371), the figure is still significantly higher than any yearly total between 2010 (104 060) and 2014 (282 933).
This means that the pressure on the external borders of the EU remained exceptionally high in 2016.
The migratory pressure at the EU’s external borders with Turkey has been easing since October 2015. An important
factor in this regard is the EU-Turkey statement, which came into force in March 2016, in which Turkey agreed to
secure its maritime and land borders and accept the return of irregular migrants from Greece. Nevertheless, Greek
Hotspots saw several riots last year resulting in injuries and material damage. Similar security problems and
overcrowding in Bulgaria reflected persistent tensions in reception facilities and the precarious situation of
migrants and refugees.
Never before had detections been so high in the Central Mediterranean area, with 181 459 in 2016, which is 18%
more than in 2015. For the third consecutive year, detections in the Central Mediterranean Sea have exceeded 100
000. Irregular migration via Libya is dependent on the services of the smuggling networks. Therefore, any activity
that would disrupt or deter these groups could significantly curb the flow of irregular migrants into the EU.
The increasing number of vulnerable persons moving through the Central Mediterranean, in particular Nigerian
women, makes it very clear that effective detection of people trafficked for sexual exploitation, forced labour
and other purposes remains a major challenge for border authorities.
The establishment of Hotspots in southern Italy helped to considerably improve the registration of new arrivals.
However, many arriving migrants were also disembarked outside Hotspot areas, which undermined the uniform
application of registration rules.
As in the case of the Central Mediterranean, never before had detections on the Western Mediterranean route
been as high as in 2016, with more than 10 000 detections. This is 46% more than in 2015 on the same route, and
21% more than in 2011, the previous record-breaking year. Most migrants were from Africa, which indicates the
growing pressure of irregular immigration from this continent towards the EU.
In 2016, more than 7 000 people were detected with fraudulent documents at the EU’s external borders. This
represents a decrease of about 15% compared with the previous year. However, as in 2015, the number of people
detected travelling with fraudulent documents within the EU proved higher than at the external borders (almost
11 000 reported in 2016). In addition to the smuggling of migrants, document fraud emerged as a key criminal
activity linked to the migration crisis. Fraudulent documents can be in fact used or re-used for many other criminal
or terrorist activities. This will continue to represent a substantial threat to the security of the EU in 2017.
Within the Schengen free-movement area, several EU Member States and Schengen Associated Countries (Germany,
Austria, France, Sweden, Denmark and Norway) introduced temporary controls at specific border sections. These
controls have been extended until the first months of 2017 amid continued concerns about managing spontaneous
flows and repeated terrorist attacks in several Member States.
Even though Turkey accepted a number of irregular migrants from Greece and a greater number of failed asylum
applicants were returned to Western Balkan countries, the overall number of effective returns at EU level remained
relatively stable in relation to 2015, with 176 223 effective returns reported in 2016 (+0.6%). With regard to returns,
the main issue continued to be linked to the difficulties in obtaining travel documents from countries of origin in
time.
Overall, there is an underlying threat of terrorism-related travel movements. This is mainly due to the fact that
the Syrian conflict has attracted thousands of foreign fighters, including EU citizens, dual-nationality holders and
third country nationals.

1.2. Developments at Policy Level
In 2016, Frontex work was significantly shaped by the dynamic European and international policy environment,
particularly in the EU area of freedom, security and justice.

15

The key milestone for the Agency was the swift adoption of the European Border and Coast Guard Regulation4,
reinforcing the mandate of Frontex.
EU Agenda on Migration
Implementation of the European Agenda on migration was at the forefront of the Agency’s work, informing policy
level discussions and, where relevant, contributing to the implementation of the following initiatives:
Revised proposal for an Entry-Exit System to facilitate and reinforce border check procedures for non-EU
nationals;
The proposed reform of the Common European Asylum System (CEAS), including Dublin Regulation,
European Union Agency for Asylum, Asylum Procedures Regulation, Qualification Regulation, Reception
Conditions Directive and EU Resettlement Framework;
Proposal to adapt and reinforce the Eurodac system, with a view to facilitating returns and helping tackle
irregular migration;
Proposal for a targeted modification to the Schengen Borders Code to make checks on EU citizens against
all relevant databases mandatory. Checks on all third country nationals and EU citizens will now be
mandatory both when entering and when exiting the EU.
Implementation of the EU Action plan against migrant smuggling (2015-2020), EU action plan on return, and the
detailed ‘Back to Schengen Roadmap’ have provided a framework for the Agency’s work in these areas.
-

European Agenda on Security
Implementation of the effective and sustainable Security Union opened a number of new opportunities for
strengthening border security in the EU. Significant efforts have been dedicated to strengthening information
sharing, and making the best use of existing tools, systems, and EU Agencies, including Frontex. Key developments
include:
Proposal for the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS) to strengthen security
checks on visa-free travellers. With ETIAS Central Unit envisaged to be part of Frontex, implementation
of the system, once adopted, will require close interagency cooperation, particularly between eu-LISA,
Frontex, and Europol;
The establishment of the High Level Expert Group on Information Systems and Interoperability, with
participation of Frontex, Europol, eu-LISA and other EU agencies;
Adoption of the EU Passenger Name Records (PNR) Directive and subsequent EU PNR implementation plan;
Proposals to revise the Schengen Information System (SIS), aiming to enhance the ability of the system to
fight terrorism and cross-border crime, improve border and migration management and ensure an
effective information exchange between Member States.
Key areas of attention have been reinforced by Action Plans adopted in February 2016 on strengthening the fight
against terrorist financing, in June on prevention of radicalisation leading to violent extremism, and in December
on strengthening the European response to tackle travel document fraud.
-

EU external relations policies and international mechanisms
-

-

In June, the new EU Global Strategy on Foreign and Security Policy outlined a vision for the EU’s global
role, highlights common ground presents a common way forward.
Building on the European Agenda on Migration, the Council endorsed the Commission’s proposal on the
new results-oriented Partnership Framework with third countries, aiming to mobilise and focus EU action
and resources in the EU’s external work on managing migration. Structured in the form of "compacts", the
renewed partnership envisages measures tailored to the situation and needs of each partner country,
depending on whether they are a country of origin, transit or a country hosting many displaced persons.
Implementation of the EU-Turkey Statement led to substantive decrease of irregular arrivals through the
Aegean Sea, and helped to significantly reduce the number of lives lost at sea.
On the basis of its Global Approach to Migration and Mobility (GAMM), border security continues to be an
important element of the EU’s dialogue with third countries at bilateral, regional and continental levels.
This includes migration policy dialogues through the Khartoum-, Rabat-, Budapest- and Prague Processes,

1.3. Frontex New Mandate
The establishment of a European Border and Coast Guard, as announced by President Juncker in his State of the
Union Speech on 9 September 2015, is part of the measures set out under the European Agenda on Migration to
reinforce the management and security of the EU's external borders. The Schengen area without internal borders
is only sustainable if the external borders are effectively secured and protected.
On 15 December 2015, the European Commission presented a legislative proposal for the creation of the European
Border and Coast Guard, building on existing structures of Frontex, to meet the new challenges and political
realities faced by the EU, both as regards migration and internal security. The European Border and Coast Guard
was approved by the European Parliament and Council in a record time of just nine months.
While the “European Border and Coast Guard Agency” replaces the “European Agency for the Management of
Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union”, it has the same
legal personality and the same short name: Frontex.
The European Border and Coast Guard helps to manage migration more effectively, improve the internal security
of the European Union and safeguard the principle of free movement of persons. The establishment of a European
Border and Coast Guard aims at ensuring a strong management of the EU’s external borders as a shared
responsibility between the Union and its Member States.
Under the new mandate, the role and activities of Frontex were significantly expanded. Frontex’ permanent staff
will be more than doubled and the Agency will be able to purchase its own equipment and deploy them in border
operations at short notice. A rapid reserve pool of at least 1,500 border guards and a technical equipment pool is
at the disposal of the Agency – meaning there should no longer be shortages of staff or equipment for Agency rapid
interventions. The European Border and Coast Guard will ensure the implementation of Union standards of border
management through periodic risk analysis and mandatory vulnerability assessments. The Agency has also been
recognized a clear role in the security of the external borders (fight against cross-border crime, terrorism,
collection of personal data for the purpose of criminal investigation) and in the development of EU coast guard
function. The Agency is tasked with the development of a technical and operational strategy for the European
integrated border management. Its role in the management of irregular migration was increased through an
extended mandate in the field of return and the possibility to collect personal data for the purpose of migration
management.

2. STRATEGIC ACTION AREAS
2.1. Joint Operations and Pilot Projects
The main operational focus of Frontex in 2016 was on the Central and Eastern Mediterranean areas which
experienced the most significant migratory pressure. Considerable operational resources were also allocated to
the Western Balkan area where migrants that entered the EU in Bulgaria and Greece flowed into (so called
secondary movements).
This phenomenon was a continuation of the migration crisis that started in 2015. Since then there has been a
significant increase of resources directed at strengthening Frontex’s capacity to carry out joint operations in the
areas most affected by large flows of irregular migration.
2016 saw a doubling in the number of guest officers deployed to operational areas (from 2,195 Guest Officers in
2015 to 5,218 Guest Officers in 2016) and a 160% increase in the number of man-days spent on operations (from
107,426 in 2015 to 285,823 in 2016), supported by a further 421 coordinating staff from the host countries who
contributed 30,675 man hours to the activities. To add to this, more than double the number of heavy equipment
crew members were also deployed (2,944 in 2016 and 1,200 in 2015) performing almost double the number mandays in the operational areas (129,372 in 2016 and 72,000 in 2015).
In 2016 the number of patrolling hours performed by aerial and maritime means were at the similar level as in
2015 – again approximately 81,000 patrolling hours were performed for sea and land border surveillance purposes.
There were changes in the type of equipment selected with a shift from smaller items of equipment to larger, and
therefore more expensive ones. However, the use of larger equipment enabled larger areas to be patrolled as well
as the deployment of equipment with greater range and handling capacity thereby increasing the relative
efficiency or the activities. Land means (patrol cars, Thermo-Vision Vans and light equipment such as surveillance
cameras and detectors) were deployed for 133,000 operating hours.
The increase in operational activities (including joint operations and return activities) are visible in the budgetary
and staff developments of 2016. The budget was increased to 161,562,000 EUR (which is 175% compared to the
92,009,000 EUR allocated in 2015), this represents almost 70% of the overall budget of the Agency for 2016
(232,757,000 EUR). It was accompanied by a 23% increase in the number of Frontex-staff working on joint
operations and return activities (from 71 to 88).
2016 was thus a year of significant change, challenges, readjustment and a scaling up of the activities being
implemented. At the same time Frontex continued to assist Member States and Schengen Associated Countries
(MS/SAC) develop their own capacity and effectiveness in the area of border control through the exchange of good
practices, expanding its network of contacts both in the MS/SACs and third countries, as well as learning by
example.
In 2016 Frontex developed also a number of new tools for the management of resources and the more precise and
extensive reporting of deployment information.

2.1.1. Sea Borders
The sea border activities of Frontex were performed under the umbrella of five joint operations - Poseidon, Triton,
Hera, Indalo, Minerva as well as rapid intervention - Poseidon. With a difficult situation at the external EU borders,
especially in the Central Mediterranean and Eastern Mediterranean regions, 2016 marked big increase in
operational activity resulting in interception of high number of migrants (approx.370,000) and consequently high
number of persons being thoroughly screened. 2016 saw also an increased cooperation with other players in the
security domain such as the cooperation with EU NAVFOR Med Sofia in the margins of joint operation Triton and
the NATO in joint operation Poseidon.
In total, 369 645 migrants were intercepted during the joint maritime operations. With regard to the geographical
areas: 178,961 migrants were registered in JO Triton in the Central Mediterranean, and 185,944 migrants arrived
to Greece during joint operation Poseidon and rapid intervention Poseidon. It worth to mention that assets cofinanced by Frontex in all joint maritime operations have contributed in rescuing 90 517 persons in distress at sea.
The Hotspot concept was also implemented resulting in increased migrant registration, fingerprinting and screening
procedures.
During 2016, there were 1020 suspected facilitators apprehended, some EUR 243 m. worth drugs and 14 m.
contraband cigarettes seized.
Such a scale of operational and screening activities required deployment of a big number of guest officers and
technical equipment items. Deployed experts performed some 290% more operational man-days compared to 2015.

19

Apart from joint operations in 2016 there were six maritime focal points activated leading to detection of 236
smuggling incidents involving 332 people and one case of drug smuggling. Focal Points Sea was implemented for
182 operational days.
Highlights: Cooperation with Third Countries within Joint Operations
During 2016, in the framework of joint operation Triton, observers from Albania, Moldova, Ukraine and Nigeria
have been deployed in the International Coordination Centre (ICC) to improve cooperation.
These deployments have proven to bring concrete operational results as the example of cooperation with Albanian
authorities via the observer deployed in the ICC. On 29 June 2016, Frontex co-financed German helicopter detected
a fast boat loaded with drugs sailing to the Italian coast. When smugglers realized that they were monitored, they
diverted their route heading to the Albanian coast and threw the cargo of drugs at sea while being constantly
under monitoring by the helicopter. Albanian observer in the ICC contacted with respective Albanian authorities
promptly; a clearance to enter Albanian national airspace was obtained for the German helicopter that allowed to
continue the surveillance activity. As a result, two Italian boats of Guardia di Finanza, on duty at Nufronguarfi
Durres (Albania), intercepted and stopped the boat. Two Albanian smugglers were arrested and 165 kg of marijuana
were recovered from the sea.

Highlights: Poseidon Rapid Intervention and Frontex’ role within the hotspots concept in Greece
Based on the request of Greece, the Poseidon Rapid Intervention (PRI) has been launched for a period of five
months (January-May 2016) aiming to support the requesting Member State in responding to the urgent and
exceptional migration related pressure at the external EU borders within the Eastern Mediterranean region. There
were 2256 officers deployed and 83 technical resources (aerial, maritime and terrestrial assets) from 40 different
border control authorities of 28 Member States.
During the PRI more than 1 600 incidents of illegal border crossings involving more than 166 000 apprehended
irregular migrants were reported. Out of these incidents, more than 900 have turned to Search and Rescue (SAR)
cases resulting to almost 48 000 rescued persons.
In light of the EU-Turkish statement, the readmission activity has been incorporated in the frame of PRI as from
28 March 2016. Readmission activity was led by the Greek authorities with the support in human resources and
transportations means provided by Frontex. Between end March and end May 2016 (the end of the PRI), 441 persons
were readmitted to Turkey through 12 readmission operations. The readmission operations took place from
hotspots areas (Lesvos, Chios, Kos, and Samos) to designated Turkish ports. Pakistan (58%), Afghanistan (14%) and
Bangladesh (9%) were the top-three countries of origin of the readmitted migrants.
Throughout the 2016 the hotspots concept including the EU Regional Task Force (EURTF) cooperation platform has
been developed. In the frame of this concept, five hotspots (Lesvos, Chios, Samos, Kos and Leros) were established,
where the EU agencies, such as Frontex, Europol and European Asylum Support Office (EASO), have been working
closely at the EURTF and on the respective islands. They were bringing support to the national authorities to cope
with the challenging migratory situation in a coordinated manner. The hotspots approach within the Frontex
mandate has been incorporated and implemented via the PRI followed by the joint operation Poseidon.

Highlights: European cooperation on coast guard functions
Interagency cooperation, involving European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) and European Fisheries Control Agency
(EFCA) was enhanced within the umbrella of the Pilot Project “Creation of a European coastguard function”. The
aim of the project was to enhance cooperation of coast guard functions in the EU, as well as to test practical
cooperation among agencies as part of the European Parliament’s Priority Actions.
Following this approach operational plans of all joint maritime operations were amended to incorporate closer
interagency cooperation and develop standard operating procedures.
Joint planning and reporting at operational level optimises the use of available assets and human resources, with
up to now more than 600 aircraft sightings of fishing vessels by the EFCA fisheries inspectors having boarded patrol
vessels and maritime patrol aircraft used for border surveillance.
This has led to an increased detection rate of potential “Illegal, Unreported or Unregulated Activities (IUU)” in the
region. Furthermore, nine possible pollution cases have been detected by maritime patrol aircraft deployed by
Frontex and reported to the respective national authorities for further follow up. Combined regular operational
briefings and trainings are undertaken by the relevant Agencies’ experts in the field.
Supplementing operational cooperation with and between coast guard authorities executing border management
functions, a European Coast Guard Cooperation Network was created bringing together more than 40 different
national authorities from EU Member States (including coast guards, navies, border police, customs and maritime

20

authorities), various EU agencies, other EU bodies and international organisations (UNHCR, Interpol and NATO), as
well as officials from non-EU countries. The 1st meeting of this network was held in Warsaw in November 2016.
Besides reinforced cooperation with EMSA and EFCA, Frontex also provided operational and technical support to
the national authorities responsible for search and rescue (SAR) and for combatting cross-border crime. During
maritime operations coordinated by the Frontex in the Mediterranean Sea in 2016:

2,669 search and rescue cases were registered;

1,020 suspected facilitators were apprehended;

80 tons of hashish worth EUR 120 m., 1.7 tons of cocaine worth EUR 103 m. and 13.8 tons of marihuana
worth EUR 20 m. were seized, mostly in the Western and Central Mediterranean Sea; 14-million
contraband cigarettes worth EUR 3.2 M. were seized.

2.1.2. Land Borders
The land border activities of Frontex were performed under the umbrella of four joint operations – Focal Points
Land, Coordination Points, Flexible Operational Activity 2016 (Border Surveillance and Border Checks).
The unstable migratory situation in 2016 lead to numerous requests from Member States for increased support at
their external land borders. To this end, Frontex coordinated activities supported, among others, the enhancement
of the operational activities at the mostly affected Bulgarian - Turkish border with the reinforcement of border
surveillance aiming at strengthened control of the migratory flows arriving to the EU.
Throughout 2016, increased support was provided at the Bulgarian – Serbian and Greek - the Former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia borders with the aim to control the attempts of migrants for secondary movements towards
Serbia. At the same time, Hungarian – Serbian and Croatian-Serbian borders were supported in order to ensure
consistency of the enhanced operational activities in the Western Balkans area.
Two new Coordination Points were established in Serbia and Montenegro in 2016, thus further enhancing the
operational cooperation between Member States and Third Countries.
In this context intelligence gathering from all border areas ensured continuous monitoring of the situation,
identification of possible risks and threats, increased situational awareness across the mainly affected land border
areas and consequently increased reaction capability of Member States.
Focal Points Land
The new features of this operation for 2016 were the establishment of eight new Focal Points, enhanced exchange
of information between Focal Points and Police and Customs Cooperation Centres and carrying out of a Joint Action
Day Danube co-led by Frontex and Hungary (in the framework of EMPACT).
Coordination Points
This main new feature of this operation for 2016 was the establishment of 2 new coordination points namely Mali
Zvornik (Serbia-Bosnia and Herzegovina border) and Sukobin (Montenegro-Albania border).
Flexible Operational Activities - Border Surveillance
The new features of this operation for 2016 were the enforcement of exit-controls as a new element along the
Bulgaria-Serbia border in order to control the secondary migration routes along the Western Balkans route,
significantly enhanced support provided at the Bulgaria-Turkey border as well as increased support with human
and technical resources via rolling open calls was provided to Hungary, Bulgaria and Greece.
Flexible Operational Activities - Border Checks
This operation constituted a new feature in 2016. Targeted support to specific border-crossing points, previously
provided by Joint Border Check Teams, as from 2016 is being provided in a structured way within the framework
of a joint operation.
Highlights: Cooperation with customs authorities
The concept of information exchange between Police and Customs Cooperation Centres (PCCCs) and Focal Points
have been elaborated and integrated in the framework of joint operation Focal Points 2016 Land between August
and October.
The core idea was to provide local staff of the Member States hosting the operation and guest officers deployed in
this joint operation with the possibility to check relevant information on persons and vehicles in the appointed
PCCCs for the purpose to render more efficient the border check procedure and decrease the response time.
After the positive evaluation of this new product by stakeholders, the continuation is foreseen as part of the joint
operation Focal Points 2017 Land regular activities.

21

2.1.3. Air Borders
Frontex-coordinated joint operations at the international EU airports were performed under the umbrella of six
joint operations – Vega Children, Focal Points Air 2016 – Regular Officers, Focal Points Air 2016 Intermediate
Managers and Pegasus.
The intensity of operational activities at the EU external air borders was enhanced and the number of man-days
of air-border joint operations increased by nearly 9% compared to 2015 reaching the level of almost 9,000.
Apart from joint operations implemented at the international EU airports Frontex initiated a number of pilot
projects aiming at reinforcing border management at the EU external borders (e.g. Reference Manual), and events
aiming at promotion of cooperation between different border management actors (e.g. Heads of Airports
Conference).
Vega Children 2016
The main focus of this operation was the detection of unaccompanied minors. Within the framework of this joint
operation a documentary film was created on the Vega Children activities which will be used for awareness raising
purposes and a promoting effective protection measures for vulnerable persons and groups (children and victims
of trafficking in human beings) at the external air borders.
Focal Points Air 2016 - Regular Officers
Focused on the detection of individuals involved in criminal activities arriving at airports in Member States and
third countries. Provision of enhanced future operational cooperation with the countries involved.
Focal Points Air 2016 – Intermediate Managers
Focused on sharing of knowledge and experience, best practices increased operational cooperation.
Pegasus 2016
The most significant new development in 2016 regarding this operation was the organisation of Joint Action Days
(JAD) Bellerophon, which took place within the framework of the EMPACT5 operational action plan 2016: illegal
immigration.
Alexis 2016
The operation was implemented in two stages. The aim of the first one (Alexis I) was to enhance EU airport border
guard’s document expertise as well as their capabilities to examine EU travel documents and Schengen Visas.
Moreover, officers taking part in this activity could enhance their behavioural and profiling assessment of
passengers for detecting document fraud used for the purpose of smuggling and Trafficking in Human Beings (THB).
The second stage (Alexis II) complemented the first activity by enhancing officers’ capabilities to detect and react
to abuses related to transits from and to third countries in selected airports.
Eurocup 2016
Based on the request of France, 15 Member States, 3 third countries (Albania, Turkey and Ukraine) and 7
participating airports took part in joint operation Eurocup 2016. 28 guest officers and third-country observers were
deployed for the purpose of enhancing security surrounding in connection with 2016 European Football
Championships held in France.
Operational activities led to increased targeted reaction capabilities, better allocation of available resources
(officers with specific knowledge/expertise), and enhanced situational awareness leading to improved focused
recommendations.
Reference Manual
The last version of the Reference Manual library (RM2016) was issued in December and contained contains 10%
more than the previous version, reaching 7014 files. The manual contains information that can enhance first-line
officers’ capability to verify the authenticity of inspected travel documents.
Positive experiences led Frontex to start working on the development of the tool in cooperation with INTERPOL.
The project definition phase started in 2016 and is expected to bring its first fruits in 2017.
Operational Heads of Airports Conference
The Operational Heads of Airports Conference is organised by Frontex on annual basis. Operational commanders
responsible for border control at international airports meet to discuss vital operational issues at stake. The
additional value of the conference was the facilitation of personal contacts and sharing of good practice between
the operational leaders of international airports. The 2016 edition was attended by 132 officials - commanders of
border guard authorities at airports and representatives of different organisations related to passengers handling
and airport security.

Highlights: Joint Operation Eurocup 2016
Frontex was requested to support France in improving border and internal security for the duration of the UEFA
2016 Championship which was held between 10 June and 10 July. It was considered that bringing assistance of
border guards from the qualified Member States and third countries will help maintaining a safe and secure
environment for the players and supporters as well as strengthening external border security measures around the
football matches. Risk analysis undertaken by the French authorities identified a need to deploy officers at the
external air borders to relieve the burden of local border guards.
Seven participating French airports i.e. Paris CDG, Paris Orly, Bordeaux, Lyon, Toulouse, Marseille, and Nice were
supported by 28 guest officers and third country observers from 15 Member States and three third countries
(Albania, Turkey and Ukraine). The officers deployed were being redeployed according to the repositioning of their
national teams and supporters match-by-match.
The operational concept was to deploy a core team (standing team) of officers to Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport
while the other ones (mobile teams) were following the tournament results. These officers strengthened external
border control under the supervision of the local authorities, by providing expertise in document fraud and specific
language needs, with passengers at the border crossing points that may have dissimulated their real intentions.
During the operational phase 23 incidents were processed and validated by Frontex. These incidents related to 38
persons of which 36 were irregular passengers, detection of 16 falsified documents. There were also 23 cases of
irregular migration and two incidents of facilitation or suspected facilitation.
The tournament progressed without any major security problems. The feedback received from the local authorities
concerning the joint operation was very positive with this large-scale deployment being considered to be very
useful to France especially at a time of heightened security.

2.1.4. Returns
New mandate on returns
The new Regulation on the European Border and Coast Guard has broadened the Frontex’ mandate on return as
follows:
Possibility to coordinate or organise returns on Frontex initiative, including through the chartering of
aircraft;
Support Member States in carrying out national return operations, voluntary departure and collecting
return operations;
Provide technical and operational assistance to Member States experiencing particular challenges with
regard to their return systems;
Provide support to the Member States on consular cooperation for the identification of third-country
nationals and the acquisition of travel documents;
Building synergies and connecting Union-funded networks and programmes in the field of return;
Coordinate the use of relevant IT systems;
Organise, promote and coordinate activities enabling the exchange of information and the identification
and pooling of best practices in return matters between the Member States.
Return operations
In 2016 Frontex assisted 232 Return Operation (+251% comparing with the operation assisted in 2015) returning in
total 10,698 people. The budget committed for joint return operations in 2016 was EUR 30,5m.
Frontex started supporting Member States in the implementation of national return operations (NROs) even before
the new regulation entered into force. Both the wording and the implementation of Art. 9 of the former Frontex
regulation called for a more flexible approach in accordance with the EU policy on return. The ED Decision 2016/36
of 23.03.2016 adopted a broader interpretation of JROs, allowing Frontex to support more MS with NROs, not only
frontline MS.
The ‘Collecting Joint Return Operations’ concept (escorts and aircrafts, used to collect irregular migrants in a
Member State and return them to their country of origin, are from the third country of return) was developed
already in 2013. Nevertheless, in 2016 the number of Collecting Return Operations coordinated by Frontex
increased up to 15, more than in the three previous years in total.
In 2016 Frontex provided a dedicated assistance to specific Member States such as Greece. Gap analysis performed
by the Agency indicated that lack of available funding and the absence of a framework contract for charter aircraft
had a direct impact on the effective return of irregular migrants. Alternatives to facilitate Greek participation on
flights and organisation of joint return operations were successfully explored, agreed and implemented. Return
operations organised by other Member States to countries such as Pakistan, Georgia and Nigeria were carried out
in a way to include a stopover in Athens to board on the spot the returnees from Greece.

23

Furthermore, Frontex launched a call for support to Member States and quickly negotiated arrangements with
Denmark, Austria, Belgium and Norway to charter aircrafts for Greece and other Member States in need (e.g. Italy
for flights to Nigeria) to carry out return and readmission operations.
Based on the EU-Turkey statement, Frontex started to assist Greece for the organisation and implementation of
readmission operations to Turkey: from April until December there were 35 operations implemented, 11 conducted
by air to Adana and 24 by ferry.
In 2016 Frontex has implemented the “Rolling Operational Plan” on return support activities by using the newly
developed web-based Frontex Application for Return (FAR) in order to be able to better coordinate return
operations, collect Member States’ needs for assistance, and ensure that Member States’ requests can be
implemented in a more efficient and user-friendly way.
The FAR is incorporated under the Integrated Return Management Application (IRMA) developed by the European
Commission. The inclusion of FAR under IRMA allows Frontex and Member States to actively contribute to achieving
an effective exchange of return related information among all partners as one of the possible measures to increase
the number of returns.
Pre-return Activities
Frontex’s broadened mandate on return led to the establishment of a new Pre-return Activities Network (PRAN);
its first meeting took place in December. The intention of Frontex was to establish the PRAN network as a single
network of communication for all pre-return related activities, such as invitations for meetings, third country
identification missions or activities of EU-led programmes.
Within Flexible Operational Activities in Return, support was provided in particular to Greece, Italy and Bulgaria.
They took shape of deployments of experts to Greece to foster practical cooperation with third-country consular
staff, development of a national return model, and drafting a protocol and internal operational procedures for the
bio-metric identification of Pakistani irregular migrants. Moreover, training of escorts in Greece and Bulgaria were
organised and support of long-term deployments of third-country experts assisting Italy in identification process
was provided.
In 2016 best practices for the organisation of return operations to Nigeria were revised together with the Nigerian
representatives as well.
The phase-in/phase-out process with the EU-funded programmes Eurint and EURLO, supported by COM started in
Q4/2016. The inventory of the programmes and their comparison with the Frontex mandate, its legal and financing
scheme was carried out and the first steps, like co-chairing of the EURLO Steering Group Committee meetings and
Eurint Country Working Groups, were agreed and implemented.

2.2. Management of Pooled Resources
In order to implement all 2016 operational activities Frontex had to coordinate the deployment of appropriate
resources coming from the Member States. This process starts in the preceding year where Member States offer
the resources, needed against the operational plans for the year in question.
The 2016 operational activities received adequate level of support in terms of experts, technical equipment and
deployment of seconded national experts. As operational needs change over the year Frontex was continuously
monitoring the situation, performing gap assessments and publishing a number of calls for contributions. During
the year, the 2017 ABN with the Member States took place and agreements on the level of operational support
were made.
In order to address the lack of operational resources in Frontex coordinated activities a monthly ABN
implementation meeting was established under the chairmanship of the ED or DED. The purpose of this meeting is
to find viable solutions for deploying additional resources in the operational areas based on the gap analysis
performed for the upcoming 3 months.
The new regulation on the European Border and Coast Guard established new elements in the activities related to
pooling of resources. Frontex had to address these new needs and integrated them with the old ones.
The first action was to revise the profiles of experts to be made available for the European Border and Coast Guard
Teams. Frontex did it in cooperation with the Member States and the European Commission. As a result, two new
profiles were created: dog handler and European coast guard functions officer. Besides, three new expert profiles
corresponding to the new tasks in the area of return activities were developed: forced-return monitor, forcedreturn escort and return specialist. As a consequence, three return pools, consisting of experts corresponding to
these profiles were effectively set up.

24

Another important development in the area of pooling resources was the establishment of the new mandatory
rapid reaction pools for human and technical resources. The new regulation entered into force in October, by
December Member States confirmed the availability of expected 1500 experts to be placed at the immediate
disposal of Frontex for deployment in case of a rapid intervention.
With the overarching idea of making operational resources available when and where needed Frontex exploited
framework contracts for aerial surveillance and awarded seven specific contracts for Frontex Aerial Surveillance
Services (FASS) for the purpose of different operations – Poseidon, Triton, as well as Flexible Operational Activity
Western Balkans. In addition, Frontex implemented one aerial surveillance demonstration exercise related to the
launch of the European Border and Coast Guard. Answering to changing political situation decided by the European
Council after entry into force of the EU–Turkey statement in March, Frontex signed as well a contract for
transportation services on land and by sea for the purpose of readmission operations.
Changing migratory situation and arrival of a big number of people at the external EU borders posed also questions
of different than logistical nature. One of them was of health nature. In order to generate awareness on potential
safety and health risks among the participants of Frontex coordinated activities, Frontex issued five health and
safety guidelines on a number of diseases that have been reported or could potentially be encountered in the
operational areas. The Agency taking a wider - organisational safety and health - perspective conducted a
preliminary research and commissioned a study to look into mental health factors and psychological hazards among
officers deployed in Frontex activities in hotspots in Italy.
Highlights: New return experts’ pools
Frontex enhanced mandate in returns, stemming from the provisions of the European Border and Coast Guard
Regulation, required establishment of three new pools of forced-return monitors, forced-return escorts and return
specialists. These experts are to participate in return operations and to be a part of the tailor-made European
return intervention teams constituted by Frontex for deployment under the framework of Migration Management
Support Teams and during return interventions as well as during rapid return interventions.
Frontex had to first develop the profiles and identify knowledge, skills and competences necessary to perform such
work. A joint work of Frontex, member States and the European Commission led to creation of such profiles and
establishment of a pool of experts from the Member States ready to be deployed as already in January 2017, upon
entry into force of the relevant provisions related to return activities.
Frontex assessed the needed number of members of each pool for 600 forced-return escorts, 50 forced-return
monitors and 40 return specialists.

2.3. Risk Analysis
In 2016 the delivery of regular strategic and operational analytical outputs were marked by the change connected
with implementing the enhancements of the mandate included in the Regulation (EU) No 1168/20116 and the
preparation for the establishment of the European Border and Coast Guard Regulation (EU) 2016/1624.
Since early 2016, Frontex has been preparing for the implementation of the new regulation, which has affected
the Agency thoroughly, especially in areas of vulnerability assessment and personal data processing. Frontex has
been tasked to prepare for, and following the adoption of the new regulation to implement the vulnerability
assessment.
The development of methodology and consultations with Member States have been taking place since summer
2016, to enable the adoption of the Common Vulnerability Assessment Methodology in November and subsequent
launch of the Vulnerability Assessment actions.
With reference to the processing of personal data following the necessary preparations concluded during 2015, in
2016 the provisions of 1168/2011 regulation on processing of personal data for risk analysis were implemented
with personal data collecting activities gradually rolled out to cover all sea joint operations. In total over 650 cases
containing personal data with contextual information were transmitted from Frontex to Europol in 2016, including
almost 1900 person descriptions, and 300 person identities along with over 1000 telephone numbers and 400

With reference to the extended scope of the mandate on processing of personal data in 2016/1624 Regulation,
early preparation enabled smooth dialogue with European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) and an amended
positive EDPS opinion in November 2016 allowing Frontex to implement selected new activities on processing of
personal data for risk analysis, namely (1) process personal data on terrorists, (2) enable Frontex staff to collect
personal data (3) send collected and processed personal data back to the host Member State .
The migration crisis in 2015 has generated an increased focus on migration and border security at a political level
and an enhanced demand for Frontex to provide a continuous flow of information about the situation, trends and
analysis about the root causes as well as outlook by policy makers and the media.
As a consequence, in 2016 Frontex has enhanced the production of ad hoc reports and briefing aimed at informing
high level stakeholders such as the European Commission, the Secretariat General of the Council, the EU
Parliament and various platforms of crisis management such as the EU Integrated Political Crisis Response (IPCR),
the Western Balkan and the Hotspots, developed a new line of analytical products and updates such as the Weekly
Analytical Overview.
Specific analytical output has also been tailored for partner EU agencies such as Europol, European External Action
Service (EEAS) and EU NAVFOR Med Sophia, enhancing the fruition of knowledge acquired from the ability to put
into context a wide array of information from different sources in the operational area, human intelligence and
data contributed by the Member States.
It needs to be highlighted that the changes stemming from 2011 and 2016 regulations were implemented in parallel
with regular business as usual activities and other planned enhancements for 2016, such as:
The elaboration of Data Policy for the Risk Analysis Networks with Member States, to complement the
existing guidelines and definitions;
The extension of the European Eastern Borders Risk Analysis Network to Eastern Partnership Countries;
The extension of the Africa Frontex Intelligence Community to new members and observers;
The launch of the new bi-lingual analytical product AFIC Monthly, and inclusion in the standard
deliverables of the AFIC;
The extension of the exchange of information in the Western Balkans Risk Analysis Network to cover crossborder crime, especially firearms;
Two updates of the Handbook on the Common Risk Indicators on Foreign Terrorist Fighters supporting the
operationalisation of common risk indicators in the framework of Joint Operations and beyond;
Response to the increasing needs of current and new stakeholders to be updated on the developments in
the operational area through the upgrade of existing and launch of new dedicated regular and ad hoc
analytical reports;
Increased and effective usage of analytical satellite services for tackling both illegal migration and crossborder crime;
Significant improvements in multisource data management, and most specifically in the automated
processing and advanced statistical analysis of this data.
Developing enhanced situation awareness at the EU external air borders thanks to the use of common indicators
for the reporting within Air Border Risk Analysis network.

Highlights: Development of a dedicated vulnerability assessment methodology
Since the European Commission released the road map ‘Back to Schengen’ in March 2016, Frontex has started
developing methodological proposals on how to conduct Vulnerability Assessment, one of the key novelty and main
challenge entrusted to Frontex.
Through a series of direct consultations with Member States representatives, the proposals were adapted to the
evolution of the legal text of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, which eventually entered into force
in October 2016. These preparations enabled Frontex’ Executive Director to have the management board adopting
the methodology in December 2016, and the creation of the Vulnerability Assessment Network the same month.
This network has been established as a technical forum for discussions on the implementation of the methodology.
At its first meeting, based on scoping work carried out with pilot Member States in September, the network made
preparation for the collection to the unprecedented details of the border crossing points (BCPs), border section
and main surveillance assets.
The baseline assessment, the first step of the methodology, was officially launched in January 2017, enabling the
first assessments to be delivered in April 2017, exactly one year after the challenging concept of vulnerability
assessment was outlined.

Highlights: Processing of personal data for risk analysis (PeDRA)
The PeDRA Pilot exercise was successfully launched and implemented in a succession of Joint Operations in Italy,
Spain and Greece, from 2 February 2016 until 31 January 2017. Personal data immediately began to arrive in
Frontex, were processed, used for risk analysis and then were transmitted to Europol. During the Pilot Exercise a
total of 2 800 interviews were performed and successfully reported from 5 Joint Operations resulting in a vastly
improved understanding of criminal networks involved in human smuggling. The output of the first year of
implementation of PeDRA is an analytical database containing information collected during nearly 3 000 interviews
with migrants newly arrived to the EU. The data are summarised in SAS Visual Analytics for use in risk analysis
processes, and also for business intelligence functions. The second output is a total of 677 cases containing personal
data with contextual information were transmitted from RAU to Europol on the SIENA network. These cases
contained a total of 1 858 person descriptions, and 273 person identities along with 1 093 telephone numbers and
445 addresses. All data arriving at Europol were systematically checked for matches with data already in their
system; during the Pilot Exercise data transmitted by Frontex resulted in 47 hits with the Europol databases,
highlighting potential new areas for investigation.
Alongside the ongoing operational activities, a new unplanned activities were undertaken following the adoption
of the new EBCG regulation: Frontex successfully applied to the EDPS for prior authorisation to implement three
new activities based on Art 47 of 2016/1624.

Highlights: Africa Frontex Intelligence Community
Since 2010 the Africa Frontex Intelligence Community has been a platform for joint analyses and common
knowledge sharing with respect to border security, irregular trans-border movement of people and trans-border
criminality. During 2016 AFIC successfully extended its geographical coverage and now includes also several
countries form East Africa, linked to “Khartoum process”. The Community also implemented one of the
recommendations from previous annual reports and started issuing a new monthly product during 2016. In addition,
it strengthened a sense of ownership of the African Community by organising two key workshops in Africa (in Ghana
and Mauritania), conducted expert field visits in the continent (Aflao border post between Ghana and Togo and
new airport in Nouakchott) and captured further attention from the key policy makers in Europe and Africa. The
European Commission decided to support the ambition of the AFIC to improve its capacities by adopting a decision
in support of the AFIC’s consolidation and expansion with an allocation of EUR 4 million. (The Commission
Implementing Decision on the Annual Action Programme 2016 for Article 5 of the Instrument contributing to
Stability and Peace to be financed from the general budget of the Union).

Highlights: Common Risk Indicators
In the aftermath of the Paris attacks, in November 2015 the Council tasked Frontex to support Member States with
the implementation of the Common Risk Indicators (CRIs) on Foreign Terrorist Fighters. Frontex operationalised
the CRIs developed by Member States and Europol, by including this task as an operational objective in all land
and sea BCP operations and in many air border operations. Also a dedicated CRI handbook, an awareness product
on the CRIs, was tailored by Frontex to be disseminated to guest officers and local staff involved with Frontex
coordinated operations. This CRI handbook was updated once during 2016, at the end of the year it was also
translated into seven EU languages. In addition, the preparation of a separate handbook on risk indicators on
foreign terrorist fighters was launched to be used by border control authorities in the neighbouring regions
(Western Balkans and Eastern Partnership countries).

2.4. Situation Monitoring
To stay on top of the situation, in 2016 Frontex has provided an increased range of situation monitoring products
and services such as:
- Frontex monitored the situation related to cross-border crime and irregular migration delivering over 4,600
situational reports and responding to 1,000 operational information requests;
- PeDRA module was developed in JORA system providing an IT solution for collecting and processing interview
reports including personal data thus supporting information exchange with Europol;
- Operational Media Monitoring products supported stakeholders with an enhanced, tailored situational
awareness. The recipients of the Frontex Daily Newsletters increased by 10%;
- Cooperation with Europol was enhanced with an increasing number of shared products, i.e. daily situational
reports, reports of tracked suspicious vessels;

27

- Cooperation with NATO was established with the exchange of operational information as of October 2016 about
ongoing operational activities in the Eastern Mediterranean;
- Frontex continued to provide operational information to participants of joint operation via Frontex One-StopShop (FOSS) portal. The number of FOSS users increased by 32% compared to 2015;
Important development of 2016 was the initiation of a project introducing Frontex liaison officers to the Member
States who will support Frontex with on-the-spot situation monitoring, liaising with local authorities and enhancing
communication.
In 2016 Frontex tested internal crisis management procedures; the results of the simulation exercise will support
the initiative of the Crisis and Operations Rooms upgrade that has already started.

Highlights: Eurosur Fusion Services and Copernicus Implementation
In 2016 Frontex has been providing tailored services for the enhanced situational picture at the EU external borders
(earth observation, maritime monitoring, enhanced weather forecast data) fused and delivered via the Eurosur
Fusion Services (EFS) and continuous service improvements.
Frontex handled more than 90 requests from Member States (Italy, Greece, Spain, France, Germany, Slovakia, and
Malta) and other partners for activation of services such as satellite imagery over the Central and Eastern
Mediterranean region. The latter were used to improve situational awareness with enhanced reaction capabilities
of the national border authorities. The total budgetary framework dedicated to satellite imagery services
amounted to 6,63 ME in 2016; 4,72 ME contracted under the Frontex–EMSA SLA and 1,91 ME contracted under the
Frontex–SatCen SLA respectively. These included for example vessel detection services (providing satellite imagery
of specific sea areas) and pre-frontier monitoring (providing imagery analysis of pre-frontier areas).
In addition to the frameworks mentioned before, the JORA system was upgraded six times during 2016, bringing,
also for PeDRA, an enhanced vessel tracking tool with an upgraded vessel movements’ simulation module, and
improved meteorological forecasts.
The European Commission’s Copernicus Programme supported EFS delivery. Based on the Delegation Agreement,
Frontex is now entrusted with the Border Surveillance component of Copernicus Security service. This cooperation
enhanced EFS through access to the Copernicus Data Warehouse and the provision of a wider range of satellite
imageries for border surveillance.
Highlights: Enhancing Situational Awareness in the Central Mediterranean
In addition to supporting the situational awareness of the Italian Authorities via the Eurosur Fusion Services (EFS),
Frontex enhanced cooperation with all institutional stakeholders active in the Central Mediterranean area including
the EUBAM Libya.
A tailored Geographic Information System (GIS) platform, based on JORA, was designed and delivered to EUBAM
Libya to support their situation monitoring activities of Libyan border areas. Moreover, Frontex supported EUBAM
Libya activities with tailored situation monitoring products including updates on vessels of suspected illegal
activities tracked by Frontex.
Frontex established regular cooperation with EUNAVFOR MED as well. Information provided by Frontex on vessels
detected through EFS were triggering EUNAVFOR MED activities. EUNAVFOR MED was granted access to Frontex
information exchange platforms and shared its naval assets positions information with Frontex.
Highlights: Enhancing Situational Awareness in the Eastern Mediterranean
Frontex started to provide continuous support to Greek and other European partners in the EU Regional Task Forces
(EURTF) in Piraeus. Further to the permanent presence of a service manager on the spot, Frontex representatives
supported the establishment of a local Information Exchange Office responsible for coordinating information
exchange between the authorities engaged in the EURTF.
Local support on Frontex situation monitoring services was also delivered through tailored trainings for over 100
officers of the Hellenic Police. The trainings were highly appreciated and resulted in an increased availability of
trained EFS users on the ground in various locations, together with an increased capacity to further transmit the
skills and knowledge of EFS.

2.5. Training
Educational Standards
In 2016, approximately 110 curriculum designers and trainers from Member States and Schengen Associated
Countries were trained in course design and eight Sectoral Qualifications Framework (SQF) trainers were recruited
to support the SQF alignment process.
As a result, some of the Member States have started to review their curricula and align it with Bologna and
Copenhagen principles using SQF. The updating process of the Common Core Curriculum (CCC) Basic-Level has
started in the 2016 in parallel with the SQF alignment. The review was done on the basis of recommendations
resulting from the study carried out in the context of the CCC Interoperability Assessment Programme (IAP) during
2015 including a needs analysis involving Member States and professional expertise by experts nominated by
Member States, Schengen Associated Countries and third countries. In 2016, 23 students of the European Joint
Master’s in Strategic Border Management (EJMSBM) have successfully concluded the taught component of the
programme and progressed to the dissertation stage.
Highlights: European Joint Master’s in Strategic Border Management
The EJMSBM is an example of executive management studies tailored to border and coast guard mid/high level
officers in managerial positions. Experienced border and coast guard professionals from all European Union and
high profile academics guide the students throughout this learning experience embedded within the operational
realities.
The students appreciated particularly the modern and diverse methodology and professionalism of teachers, as
well as practical and interactive dimension of seminars and workshops. The Programme has been externally
evaluated and according to the final report of the taught component “the EJMSBM can be considered an example
of an innovative Master’s-level professional programme in its design and delivery”. It was stressed that modules
achieve good balance between theory and practice and many assessments focus on ‘real-world’ issues for
international border guarding. The continuous monitoring, review and improvement process ensures that the
Programme stays operationally relevant in accordance with the highest educational standards.

Pre-Deployment Training
The new elements in the European Border Guard Teams (EBGT) training area were regional profile training courses;
following activities were organized during the year 2016:
-

three Profile training course for Debriefing experts (48 participants),
three profile training courses for screening experts (60 participants),
four second-line airport officer profile training courses (64 participants),
four EBGT land border surveillance officer training courses (72 participants),
three maritime borders surveillance officer training courses (47 participants), and
two courses for advanced document officers (30 participants).

Overall, 19 courses were organised and attended by in total 321 participants.
The Practical Tool on Access to the Asylum Procedure had been developed in close cooperation with European
Asylum Support Office (EASO).
Highlights: Regional profile training courses for screening experts
The novelty in the area of pre-deployment training was launch of the regional training courses for screeners, aimed
at developing key competences and strengthening capacities of officers tasked with nationality assumption and
screening. Three regional courses for screening experts were organised for countries most affected by the current
migration flows.
The 60 successful course participants from the targeted regions are in jobs where screening activities and
nationality assumption is performed regularly, or who have been planned for deployment to Joint Operations as
screening experts. Following the success and based on request from other Member States, also the regional course
for debriefing experts was organized.

Training Support for Border and Coast Guard Functions

29

Training initiatives established in the previous years were maintained and continuously delivered while creating
new initiatives and training opportunities anchored in the emerging border and coast guard environment. Some
examples of new developments relate to the usage of e-learning tools for a wide range of topics (e.g. English for
border guards, Schengen Borders Code) and positively facing the needs of new legal provisions (e.g. courses for
EUROSUR operators, Common Integrated Risk Analysis Model - CIRAM). Focus on quality assurance was enhanced
compared to previous years, introducing qualitative assessment for some of the courses and Sectoral Qualifications
Framework certification systems for the recognition of border guard related competences expected to adopted at
EU level, by the border guard community.
Highlights: Training Support for Border and Coast Guard Functions
Schengen Borders Code eLearning Tool (SBCLT) was officially launched on 8 March 2016, with representatives from
Member States and Schengen Associated Countries at Frontex Headquarters. The SBCLT is a virtual simulation of
border checks on persons at the Schengen external border at an airport. It can be used to improve the knowledge
about the application of the Schengen Borders Code as well as practical skills concerning the performance of border
checks in accordance with the Practical handbook.

Training Networks and Infrastructures
In 2016 Training Needs Assessment (TNA) was carried out resulting in a published TNA 2016 Report. Regular meeting
of national training coordinators - the Annual Training Conference was conducted on Fundamental Rights and Coast
Guard Functions; the Partnership Academies were presented with a new programme and financial scheme.
A pilot grant for Sectoral Qualifications Framework (SQF) alignment was launched. The national training
coordinators were invited to an annual meeting to discuss training needs. The ICT platform was contracted and
the learning management system was officially accepted and upgraded. Educational technology courses were
conducted and guidance was provided for instructional design of e-learning content, with facilitation and
maintenance of applications (V-Aula, Moodle, SBCLT). Frontex training staff received eLearning training and
webinars and courses were created.

Ad hoc Training, Missions and Logistics
In addition to logistics services needed for the training activities held in Frontex headquarters a variety of training
activities have been organised: a training for Libyan Coast Guards under EUNAVFOR MED mandate was conducted
in December 2016 on a vessel on the open sea.
Furthermore, a training event was carried out in cooperation with the European Coast Guard Functions Forum
(ECGFF) with about 50 participants. Another event was held in Split, Croatia on ‘Securing Europe’s External
Borders: European Border and Coast Guard involving around 80 participants.
Highlights: Training of Libyan Coast Guards under EU NAVFOR Med mandate
Frontex is training the Libyan officers on law enforcement at sea. Frontex has contributed to the training package
one under EUNAVFOR MED Sophia7 mandate with a “Law Enforcement” module for 59 Libyans and three tutors.
The training took place aboard the Italian naval vessel San Giorgio in December 2016 and was delivered by nine
Frontex trainers. With the training programme, Frontex is contributing to increasing the border control capacities
of the Libyan Coast Guard and Navy. The topics covered included preparing and planning of law enforcement
operations and combating of smuggling and trafficking of human beings. It also covered the protection of human
rights in all coast guard activities.

EUNAVFOR MED operation Sophia is but one element of a broader EU comprehensive response to the migration issue, which
seeks to address not only its physical component, but also its root causes as well including conflict, poverty, climate change and
persecution.

2.6. Research and Development
Harmonisation of the EU Border Control Capacities
This project aims at harmonising the EU Member States’ border control capacities – including the harmonisation of
technical equipment and working practices where necessary – and identifying future capacity needs with a view to
making the border control more efficient and effective.
Frontex aims to achieve compatibility and interoperability by working closely with Member States and other
stakeholders to develop and implement shared standards and recommendations.
These goals are achieved by examining areas of common practices and by identifying capability needs leading to
the development of successful practices and recommendations in the area of border control which are thereafter
cascaded to the policy makers and EU funded research.
Among other activities in this area Frontex published the Report on Implementation and Operation of Visa
Information System at national level, developed two trainer’s manuals: Automated Border Control (ABC) Systems
for First Line Officers, and Vulnerability Assessment and Testing for Automated Border Control Systems. The latter
two were complemented by an online self-directed training to support training of officers at the national level.
Highlights: ABC solutions
Automated Border Control (ABC) solutions have proven to be an efficient part of the border control process, being
extensively deployed in 16 Member States. The role of ABC will continue to increase significantly, meaning that
EU border guard officers and other professionals need to receive sufficient training and up-to-date information
about the border checks processes using ABC systems, fostering a clear understanding of the complex landscape
of ABC procedures and functionalities and the associated risks, vulnerabilities, and possible mitigation strategies.
In support of these objectives Frontex has developed a diverse set of training tools on ABC systems, targeting
different topical areas and levels of expertise. These training tools consist of high-quality, hardcopy trainer’s
manuals and self-directed online training tools, in support of the delivery of training on ABC systems at the national
level. The trainer’s manuals come complete with additional reference materials and notes to the trainers,
providing them with teaching and assessment methods. The online training tool is an interactive course available
on Frontex Virtual Aula, complete with narration and an online assessment allowing the trainee to assess their
level of progress. This extensive set of training tools cover the following topical areas:


Intermediate training on Automated Border Control Systems for First Line Officers aimed to provide the
participants with an understanding of the principles of ABC systems, the operation of e-Gates, role of
biometrics in identity verification systems and possible vulnerabilities;



Advanced training on Vulnerability Assessment and Testing for Automated Border Control Systems, targeting
the project managers and specialised experts, and is aimed to provide the participants with a deeper
understanding of the methods of assessment, testing, and mitigation of security risks on ABC systems.

This collective effort marks the first time that harmonised training capabilities have been developed in support of
fostering a common, EU-wide understanding of the complex landscape of ABC systems, aligned with the European
educational standards for border guarding. Moreover, it is a testimony to the excellent cooperation between
Frontex, the Portuguese Immigration and Borders Service (SEF), the German Federal Office for Information Security
(BSI), national and international experts, and the joint commitment to safeguarding an efficient and effective
management of ABC systems through the delivery of targeted and harmonised trainings at the national level.
The training tools will be introduced to the Member States in 2017 through targeted “Train the Trainer” Training
sessions, where Member States experts will have the opportunity to receive the training before transposing the
course materials to the national level.
Frontex has been working in the area of ABC since 2007 and since 2010 facilitated the ABC Working Group (WG)
composed of experts from EU Member States and third countries in order to pursue end user harmonisation and to
identify best practices in the area of ABC.

Development and Technical Assistance
Frontex’s activities in the area of development and technical assistance aim to deliver, through the implementation
of pilot projects, innovative solutions (product/technology innovation, process innovations and organisational
innovations) for border management.
The project aims to support the implementation of integrated border management by:
-

maturing new capacities and capabilities,
providing advice, technical support and expertise to internal and external stakeholders,

31

-

fostering cooperation with third countries and international organisations.

The Council Decision (EU) 2015/1523 called upon the European Agencies to provide specific support to Italy and
Greece in the context of the migration crisis. Frontex was invited to work with the respective Member States
authorities to help them in fulfilling their obligations stemming from the EU legislation to swiftly identify, register
and fingerprint incoming migrants.
Against this background, a “Registration Package” inter-agency initiative (involving eu-LISA, EASO and Frontex)
with the goal of developing a flexible solution that would be available upon request to Member States to
complement their existing capacity to perform identification and EURODAC registration of irregular migrants, was
set up. The Agencies agreed on the development of a proof of concept test. The action consisted of testing for a
limited period of time a capacity that includes providing both technical and physical infrastructure (i.e. containers
equipped with office facilities and fingerprinting scanner devices for the EURODAC registration) as well as an
adequate number of staff.
The main agreed objective of the proof of concept test was to fine-tune and gain better understanding on how a
“flexible” solution for the identification and EURODAC registration of irregular migrants could be implemented.
The lessons learnt during the running time of the proof of concept were used as direct input for the “Hot Spot”
development.

Frontex provided also technical assistance for establishing identification and registration capacities for the
management of mixed migration flows to IPA II beneficiary countries (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Kosovo, Serbia, Montenegro and Turkey).
Another important development of 2016 was the establishment of the Working Group on Advanced Traveler
Information. The working group supports Member States in developing their capacities for using Advanced Traveler
Information for the purpose of border control.

Assessment of Technologies
As part of its research and innovation activities, Frontex studies the availability and readiness of technology for
integrated border management. Frontex, in cooperation with the Member States, industry and internal
stakeholders, aims to identify technical solutions that could address operational needs, establish their readiness
to be integrated and tested in a real operational scenario, and then make recommendations for introducing these
solutions in the field.
To test potential solutions and assess their capabilities as well as identify future needs, Frontex organises
demonstrations of technology, conducts technical feasibility studies and runs pilot projects at all types of border.
Out of all activities of 2016 in this area it is worth mentioning the trial of border surveillance technology for land
borders organized in Slovakia.

Highlights: Land Border Surveillance Working Group meeting and Industry Demonstration held in Slovakia.
Key experts from the 12 European countries gathered in September to debate and observe in the real field the
current achievements in the area of border surveillance domain. During the event 12 leading companies
demonstrated a variety of technologies for border surveillance, in principal systems consisting of radars, cameras,
line detection sensors, communication systems, low altitude detection and anti-RPA8 systems.
The main outcome was the report on the Technical Best Practices and Guidelines for Border Surveillance in the
areas of: mobile land border surveillance systems, data sharing and operational communications as well as
technical equipment acquisition process, sensors for line, perimeter and for low flying detection. The technical
requirements for mobile surveillance systems serve as a basis for further development of technical specifications
for acquisition of technical equipment and have been already used for that purpose by several Member States and
one third country (under technical assistance project).

Innovation
Frontex aims to assist the European Commission with the planning and implementation of the European
Programmes for Research and Innovation which relate to border security. Under this project, Frontex provides a
platform for a two-way exchange of information between the developers of border security technologies/initiators
of research projects and their potential end-users.
Keeping up with industry’s and academia’s newest products, services, technologies and developments helps the
border guard community to identify options and opportunities for developing future capacities. It also offers
answers to specific questions and needs, helps everyone involved to understand what the trends are and – especially
for researchers in this field – to see where they are in relation to what has already been done.
The project investigates new ways of setting up and managing research and innovation at EU level, but also the
feasibility of joint procurement between border guard authorities themselves as well as border guard authorities
and Frontex.

2.7. External Relations
In the course of 2016, Frontex maintained an effective cooperation network with third countries (TCs),
international organisations, and relevant EU entities.
Cooperation with EU agencies
The Regulation on the European Border and Coast Guard opened up new possibilities for cooperation with EU
agencies in relation to the coastguard function, resulting in the trilateral working arrangement between Frontex,
the European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA) and the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) on coast guard
functions. The working arrangement was prepared in 2016 with a view to adoption by Frontex Management Board
at the beginning of 2017.
Close cooperation continued with the nine justice and home affairs (JHA) agencies, both through the JHA agencies
network, as well as on bilateral basis. Partnerships with JHA agencies were crucial for the operational activities
related to the hotspot initiatives in Italy and Greece, coordination of operational actions in the context of the EU
Policy Cycle/EMPACT, and regular exchange of border-related situational awareness and operational media
monitoring products. With regards to the engagement with Europol within the framework of EMPACT related air
border actions, Frontex participated in the Global Airline Action Days twice during 2016, attending the Command
Post at Europol HQ on both occasions. Furthermore, a Europol representative was deployed to Budapest during a
Frontex coordinated Joint Action Day (Bellerophon) in September 2016, following attendance at the predeployment briefing held at Frontex HQ.
At bilateral level, cooperation with eu-LISA was strengthened through an annual cooperation plan, whereas regular
exchange with EASO was facilitated through the deployment of EASO Liaison officer to Frontex. A cooperation
agreement with Europol, signed in December 2015, paved the way for regular transmission of personal data from
Frontex to Europol – another cooperation avenue extensively tested throughout 2016.
Cooperation with international organisations
In 2016 Frontex enhanced cooperation with Interpol. Joint activities included the ongoing Dial Doc/Reference
Manual project, tactical inclusion of Interpol officers in Frontex operational activities, close interaction between
Frontex and the Border Management component (IBM Task Force) of Interpol and Interpol’s participation in AfricaFrontex Intelligence Community (AFIC) meetings. Based on this successful cooperation, both entities identified the
need for closer strategic and operational cooperation, possibly leading to a new working arrangement in 2017.
Efforts were made to formalise the cooperation with OSCE with a possible conclusion of a working arrangement
envisaged in 2017. Similarly, possibilities for an intensified cooperation with the International Maritime
Organization (IMO) in the maritime domain, especially in the coast guard functions, and with the World Customs
Organization (WCO) in the customs domain, were explored with a view to future WAs.
The Agency resumed cooperation with EUBAM Libya paving the way for closer action in 2017 and continued close
cooperation with IOM, UNHCR, UNODC, ICMPD and other international actors in various areas of its mandate.

Cooperation with third countries
On the basis of the mandates given by the Management Board, possibilities were explored to negotiate working
arrangements with i.e. Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco and Senegal. In the frames of the ongoing revision of working
arrangements in accordance with the Regulation on the European Border and Coast Guard, updated proposals were
sent to Albania, Serbia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.

33

Frontex participated in the migration policy dialogues in the framework of the Khartoum-, Rabat-, Budapest- and
Prague Processes as well as Valletta Joint Action Plan implementation.
In accordance with the European Border and Coast Guard Regulation, an annual report was submitted to the
Management Board related to the activities Member States undertake with other Member States and/or with third
countries at the external borders of the EU, outside the framework of the Frontex activities.
2016 saw the deployment of the first Frontex liaison officer to a non-EU country (Turkey). Management Board also
approved the deployment of a liaison officer to Niger, and to Serbia. Moreover, the priority regions for possible
deployments in 2017 were approved: Western Balkans, North Africa, West Africa, Horn of Africa and the Silk Route
region.
In the strategic dimension, cooperation with the United States of America was given a new start based on the
existing working arrangement, while first steps were also made in relations with Israel.

Highlights: Enhanced cooperation with priority third countries
Work on establishing, developing and maintaining structured cooperation with non-EU countries, EU entities and
international organisations continued and was further enhanced throughout 2016. For instance, a working
arrangement was concluded with Kosovo*, which means that Frontex is now partnering with all countries of the
Western Balkan region.
Also, negotiations with Senegal and Morocco progressed well – the working arrangement with the latter was
approved by the Frontex Management Board and the signature depends on further developments on the political
level. Good contacts were established with Egypt, with an exploratory mission held in October 2016. Discussions
with Niger were initiated at the end of 2016 with a view to concluding a working arrangement. A cooperation plan
detailing the working arrangement was signed with Ukraine. The process of updating the Cooperation Plan with
Turkey commenced.
Libya remained a focus for Frontex. The Agency contributed to the capacity building and training of the Libyan
Coast Guard and Navy in the frames of additional tasks for EUNAVFOR Med Sophia operation. In that regard, training
has been provided to 59 Libyan Coast Guard officers (in addition to three tutors) in specific modules falling directly
under the remit of Frontex.

Technical assistance
Apart from the launch of the IPA II project - “Regional Support to Protection Sensitive Migration Management in
the Western Balkans and Turkey”, Frontex continued the implementation of the Eastern Partnership (EaP)
Integrated Border Management Capacity Building Project, a component of the EaP/IBM Flagship Initiative carried
out in cooperation with WCO, IOM and ICMPD. In 2016, 76 activities (of which 47 are trainings) were implemented
with 686 officials trained.
In the framework of the ENPI Project – “Promoting the participation of Jordan in the work of EASO as well as the
participation of Morocco and Tunisia in the work of EASO and Frontex”, which finished in 2016, Frontex participated
in the closing conference of the project and contributed to the final report submitted by EASO to the European
Commission.
Highlights: Launch of IPA II project in the Western Balkans
2016 marked the start of an EU-funded technical assistance project “Regional Support to Protection Sensitive
Migration Management in the Western Balkans and Turkey” in the framework of the Instrument for Pre-Accession
Assistance (IPA II) and as part of the EU accession processes of the Programme’s beneficiary countries: Albania,
Bosnia and Herzegovina, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Kosovo*, Serbia, Montenegro and Turkey.
Frontex is in the lead of the implementation of one of the components of the project aiming at introducing and
sharing EU standards and best practices on migration management. The project is being implemented jointly by
Frontex, EASO, IOM and UNHCR. In 2016, Frontex organized six regional courses in combatting trafficking in human
beings, detection of falsified documents, identification and screening of nationality, and interviewing techniques.
Two sessions which took place in the Frontex Partnership Academy in the Netherlands, whereas the remaining
trainings were hosted by Montenegro. Overall, 29 activities were conducted and 123 border guards and asylum
officers were trained in the frames of the project in 2016.

2.8. Communication
In 2016 Frontex strived for transparency and active provision of information to general public, border management
community and Frontex staff. It was a year of the change of mandate, which resulted in changing the visual identity
of the Agency, new logo, and information activities aiming at explaining the new mandate of Frontex as European
Border and Coast Guard Agency.
The official launch of the latter took place at the Kapitan Andreevo Border Crossing Point at the Bulgarian-Turkish
border with Turkey. The event included a presentation of the vehicles, equipment and teams of the new Agency,
and was attended by Bulgarian Prime Minister Mr. Boyko Borissov, Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of Interior
of Bulgaria Ms. Rumiana Bachvarova the Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship Commissioner Mr. Dimitris
Avramopoulos, State Secretary of the Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic Ms. Denisa Sakova, Executive
Director of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency Mr. Fabrice Leggeri, and other senior officials, including
high level representation from Turkey.
In the time of change the internal communication was strengthened with the use of different communication tools
such as events (i.e. town-hall meeting on the new regulation on Border and Coast Guard, live-streamed launch of
the new Agency from Bulgaria), written communication and development of a modern intranet platform that will
allow information sharing and collaboration of Frontex entities. The magnitude of communication effort can be
illustrated by the production of content for an internal newsletter that reached new highs with 17 issues and more
than 219 articles published.
Frontex continued its online communication for internal and external stakeholders. The Agency developed a new
website information architecture and graphical representation that will make browsing the new official website to
be launched in 2017 easier. Frontex’s social media communication efforts resulted in the increase of reach and
significant increase in the number of followers compared to 2015 such as 128% increase of Frontex Twitter account
followers and 72% increase of ED4BG Facebook-fanpage followers. The Agency started as well sharing its risk
analysis data on EU Open Data Portal (data.europa.eu).
In 2016, Frontex organised around 130 media visits to operational areas (including patrols and interviews) which
resulted in a wide coverage of the Agency’s activities in international media, as well as in a number of regional
media outlets. More than 800 students learned about the Agency during study visits organised in Warsaw and during
conferences attended by Frontex representatives.
Frontex has been regularly organising press conferences in European capitals. In 2016 Frontex Executive Director
and Deputy Executive Director met with groups of journalists during ten press conferences and numerous smaller
media briefings. The Executive Director gave more than 30 interviews to international media.
Frontex handled on overage 500 media requests per month, including requests for information on ongoing
activities, requests for comments, interviews or statistics. The Agency received around 150 requests for
information from the general public and researchers.
As part of 2016 outreach events, Frontex took part in Docs against Gravity, one of the world’s largest documentary
film festivals taking place in Warsaw. Frontex had its own dedicated movie section “Borderlands”, with
documentaries dedicated to the topic of migration and border management. Frontex continued to organise the
European Day for Border Guards (ED4BG), an annual event celebrating border guards from all Member States and
Schengen Associated countries. The 2016 edition focused on future of border management and the new mandate
of Frontex.
In 2016 Frontex produced more than 70 publications such as training manuals, risk analysis and general awareness
material. The video production focused on training products but there were a few general awareness movies just
to name Vega Children on trafficking in human beings or animations explaining the role of Frontex in returns and
coast guard function. Last year saw also communication-capacity development: a multimedia management system
that will allow easy retrieval of photos, videos and graphics for communication purposes was created.
Highlights: Press field visits and Field Press Coordinators
In order to increase operational transparency and assist the media on the ground, Frontex deploys Field Press
Coordinators (FPCs). Over the course of last year five Field Press Officers were deployed to Joint Operation Triton
in Italy and Joint Operation Poseidon in Greece. The FPCs are drawn from the European Border Guard pool and are
typically national border agencies’ press officers seconded to help Frontex handle media in the operational area.
Their tasks include helping journalists move around operational areas, facilitating embedding in patrols and
interviews with national officers, and collecting operational photo and video material for the press.
Last year, Frontex coordinated four two-day-long visits to Sicily to explain the functioning of Operation Triton for
a team of 25 German journalists, 11 Czech journalists, 8 Slovak journalists and 10 Spanish media representatives.
All participants of the visits had prior knowledge of migration issues and Frontex. The visits served to further
consolidate the knowledge of Frontex and its new mandate, border management and security issues among the
journalists specialised in these topics. While the visits immediately generated a high number of articles and

35

interviews about Frontex in the national media of the individual Member States, the long-term advantage is
important, as it helps build a thorough understanding of management of the EU external borders and its challenges.

2.9. Fundamental Rights
In 2016, the Fundamental Rights Officer (FRO) has continued to provide advice and develop new tools serving the
purpose of promotion of fundamental rights in border management activities.
Over the year FRO has been providing input during the drafting of operational plans to promote the respect of
fundamental rights in all Agency’s operational activities. With the entry into force of the Regulation on the
European Border and Coast Guard, FRO contributed to the alignment of operational plans with new regulation by
revising the plans and the guidelines for various profiles in the plans (debriefing, fingerprinting, etc.).
FRO designed as well a questionnaire on referral mechanisms for vulnerable groups in the Member States where
operations take place, and supported the drafting on a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) on complaint
mechanism including the complaint form for potential violations of fundamental rights. FRO proposed a
fundamental-rights specific operational objective and basic compliance indicators necessary for providing FRO
observations to the Frontex Evaluation Reports (Article 26 of the new regulation). FRO extensively contributed to
the Guide for Joint Return Operations coordinated by Frontex on fundamental rights aspects during return
operations.
FRO team has also extensively supported the training activities of fundamental-rights relevant aspects related to
specific profiles within the operational teams, as well as in the design of curricula for Member States officials i.e.
fundamental rights for border guard’s on-line tool, and fundamental rights and international protection in the EU
project for first entry officials from EASO.
The Serious Incident Report (SIR) mechanism was established as a key part of an effective monitoring mechanism
for fundamental rights in all activities. In 2016, 24 serious incidents were reported and followed-up by Fundamental
Rights Officer. As a result, FRO closed 10 incidents and provided recommendations and corrective measures while
other serious incidents are pending as the investigation is still ongoing by respective Member States’ authorities.
FRO continuously works on improvement of an effective monitoring mechanism as provided by the new regulation.
FRO team visited sea, land and return operations and provided substantive recommendations for prevention of
fundamental rights violations during operational activities. This component includes:
the setting up of a complaint mechanism as a new feature of a tool to monitor compliance with
fundamental rights in all Frontex’s activities,
the creation of an electronic case management system, drafting and consulting the complaint form,
supporting the drafting of the rules of the mechanism, and
the establishment of competent focal points within national authorities and human rights institutions that
monitor and investigate potential violations of fundamental rights by border authorities.
In addition, FRO provided specific reports on fundamental rights implications on various fundamental rights matters
of interest for the activities of Frontex, such as return and readmission and the protection of children in the
operational and training activities. FRO coordinated as well to the drafting of the profile of the forced return
monitors profile and extensively supported the creation of the pool of monitors. Moreover, FRO contributed to the
Evaluation of ‘Frontex Design for Evaluations of Joint Operations and Pilot Projects’ (2012-2016).
In March FRO presented a final draft of the Fundamental Rights Strategy after intensive internal units and external
consultation with relevant stakeholders, such as Consultative Forum and Management Board. The negotiation of
the EBCG Regulation obliged to suspend the adoption process of the FRS.
Highlights: Forced return monitoring
The FRO has been actively involved in the promotion of forced return monitoring since the beginning of her
mandate, in close coordination with the Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) and the International Center for
Migration Policy Development (ICMPD).
Since the entry into force of the Regulation on the European Border and Coast Guard, the creation of a specific
profile for forced return monitors, the FRO, in support of internal business units, has managed to effectively advise
the profile drafting for a force return monitor and the creation of a pool of forced return monitors from Member
States. The members of the pool are trained on fundamental rights related to return operations, monitoring and
reporting.

36

Notably, the exchange of reports with the FRO is enriching the analysis and understanding of a European pool that
serves to ensure compliance of fundamental rights with the highest standards and in a common understanding of
European principles and values, that is transparent and accountable.

2.10. Administration and Finance
Finance and Procurement
In 2016 Frontex kept the regulatory framework updated and adjusted to the evolving needs of the Agency. Through
the regular monitoring of the budget implementation and the implementation of the Procurement Plan, financial
services contributed to the achievement of Frontex’ objectives. Two budget amendments and 19 budget transfers
were made in order to reprioritise the Agency’s activities due to the entry into force of Frontex new mandate.
A significant increase in both numbers and amounts of commitments processed has been observed: commitments
increased in numbers by 18% and reached 3,962; the amounts increased by 61% to EUR 280.9 m. Likewise, the
number of payments processed increased by 14% to 14,124, the overall amount increased also by 60% to EUR 199.2
m.
In line with the founding and the Frontex Financial Regulation, the Agency spends the major part of its budget via
grants issued to co-finance operational activities, including return activities and via procuring products and
services.
The number of grants issued to co-finance Frontex coordinated operations increased significantly compared with
the previous year. Overall, Frontex issued 1741 grants in 2016 compared to 1323 in 2015 (+32%). Besides the number
of grants also the overall amount covered by grants almost doubled compared with 2015 and increased from EUR
99.4m to EUR 169.9m.
Overall, 1167 procurement procedures were carried out in 2016 compared to 1137 in 2015 resulting in concluding
contracts worth EUR 22.8m. The amount of contracts concluded does not include procedures that were cancelled,
not finalised yet, and the estimated values of framework contracts.
The introduction of the semi-automated tools for procurement/contract management and preparations for eprocurement are under development. A horizontal working group for contract management has been set up and
aims at delivering proposals regarding the improvement of the contract management inclusive automation.

Human Resources
In light of the extension of Frontex’ mandate and foreseen grow in staff members in the next four years a first
ever Human Resources Strategy was developed and adopted. The strategy serves as guidelines for HR management
in 2016-2019. It provides an overview of strategic and operational objectives within the area of HR and assesses
risks associated to them. The document also gives clear indication how human resources services will be provided
in a changed environment and will switch from a purely administrative support to advisory and strategic dimension.
Based on the strategy a new business model for HR services was prepared and recruitments for new functions have
been launched.
New legal provisions were smoothly implemented and staff awareness was raised. Informative sessions on pension
and insurance schemes were organized to raise the level of staff knowledge in these respects.
In 2016, a total of 134 new employees joined Frontex, there were 54 new posts published and eight employees
were reassigned to other tasks. At the end of 2016 Frontex reached a total of 365 staff members, out of which 197
temporary agents, 93 contract agents and 75 seconded national experts.
Altogether 282 employees went through the appraisal procedure; out of 66 jobholders eligible for reclassification
32 were reclassified. 40 contract renewal procedures started in 2016.
In 2016, in addition to 22 language courses (English, Polish, French, German, Spanish) held in-house and attended
by approximately 160 staff members, 96 employees participated in other courses provided in-house (for instance
workshops on performance management, trainings on MS Office 365 or basic Fundamental Rights trainings).
Apart from this, 51 employees participated in externally provided specific job-related courses (for instance
trainings on social media intelligence; a seminar on electronic procurement, an advanced Linux administrator
training or a seminar on case law in public procurement).

Internal Services and IT
In 2016 administration services continued rendering services for operational part of the Agency - regular services
and support to all other entities within the Agency which mostly entailed procurement of goods and services,

37

processing financial transactions (approx. 2,000). In 2016 Frontex hosted 845 meetings with external visitors,
received almost 14,800 guests. There were 557 cases of malfunctions and needs for repairs handled and over 2,400
missions organised.
On the top of regular tasks, Corporate Services planned and implemented the relocation of EURTF Catania into its
final premises, organised the 7th edition of the European Day for Border Guards, performed a space optimisation
study, initiated actions with view to office space expansion and contributed to the HQs Agreement negotiations.
The expatriate services handled over 300 requests for support of various complexity to support newcomers to the
Agency.
On the information and communication technologies part, maintenance, support and development of different
operational systems (e.g. Eurosur, GIS platform, Frontex-One-Stop-Shop, Frontex Media Monitor, Appraisal and HR
systems, new ICT Training platform). New ICT solutions were developed and delivered to the business area: FAR
(Frontex Application for Return), upgrade of Opera system, LENS (multimedia asset management solution).
Following the decision of the Executive Director, negotiations have been started with eu-LISA, space has been
assigned in their data centre for the Disaster Recovery Site of Frontex. Parts of the Service Level Agreement have
been drafted, a high-level planning, a design and the acquisition of the necessary equipment have been made
during the year 2016.
A Document Management System Pilot project has been run for the automation of the workflow related to the
production and approval of the Executive Director Decisions to assess the potential of the solution. The workflow
has been put in production and the project continues to go on with other workflows.
After repartitions of the tasks between the European Commission, Joint Research Centre and Frontex, the
responsibilities of different development of the Integrated Return Management Application (IRMA) platform was
agreed and Frontex was made responsible for the development of Frontex Application for Return (FAR). The
development was made and the first version put in production in October. The application is being used by the
unit responsible for organisation of return operations as well as the Member States for the announcement of the
return operations, their preparation and the organisation of the actual return activity and has so far received a
positive feedback from the users.
Most of the activities of the Data Protection Officer (DPO) in 2016 related to monitoring and compliance (e.g. by
organising the data protection awareness sessions). Assessment of operational and administrative activities
regarding impact on the individuals’ right of data protection has been performed by provision of advice and
contributing to the draft wording of different documents. DPO has been raising awareness about personal data
protection in face-to-face meetings but also distributing publications on the subject matter (e.g. Frontex Guide
on Data Protection Impact Assessment and Frontex Privacy Impact Checkbox prepared).
Follow-up of the Inspection by the European Data Protection Supervisor has been taking place on regular basis;
DPO was coordinating the status of recommendations made by the EDPS in the relevant Inspection Reports
Legal Affairs
Legal services have been provided on a regular basis to administration and operational entities, ensuring legal
consistency of their activities. A significant aspect in 2016, was the leading role taken by the Legal Affairs Unit in
organizing and coordinating a Task Force to closely follow the legislative procedure for the adoption of the Agency’s
new mandate, the European Border and Coast Guard Regulation, and in turn instruct Frontex entities on its impact
and later implementation. In fact, much of the legal advice provided last year to internal entities was on the
implementation of the provisions of the new Regulation, especially related to provisions on returns and cooperation
with third countries.
In line with the new legal framework moreover, the Complaints Mechanism was set up in close cooperation with
the Frontex Fundamental Rights Officer.
Two Legal Network (LegNet) meetings were also organized in 2016, during which legal experts or practitioners
from the Member States had a chance to discuss with the Agency unclear or tricky legal issues in an attempt to
reach a common understanding and in this way better assist the operational activities of Frontex.
In the course of 2016, 101 Executive Director (ED) Decisions and 46 Management Board (MB) Decisions were taken;
some 15 Operational Plans were signed, whilst several Cooperation Plans, Working Arrangements, Service Level
Agreements and other contracts were concluded where legal service provided was essential.
Subject to Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 when handling applications for access to documents held by it, Frontex
amended and improved its internal rules implementing that Regulation in 2016. Furthermore, by Decision No
2016/119 of the Executive Director of Frontex a ‘Transparency Office’ housed within the Legal Affairs Unit and a
network of case-handlers across the Agency, were created to better handle applications for access to documents.
More details can be found below in the Annual report on public access to document in 2016.

3.2. Key conclusions on Management and Internal
Control
Frontex conducts its operations in compliance with the applicable laws and regulations, working in an open and
transparent manner and meeting the expected high level of professional and ethical standards.
Frontex has adopted a set of internal control standards, based on international good practice, aimed to ensure the
achievement of its objectives. The financial regulation requires that the organisational structure and the internal
control systems used for the implementation of the budget are set up in accordance with these standards.
The 2016 annual review of the internal control system and organisational performance provided reasonable
assurance to Frontex management as to the level of compliance with all internal controls, on the correct
functioning of the systems in place and on organisational performance. The review highlighted the main strengths
and the potential weaknesses of the systems in place and supported the establishment of an improvement action
plan.
In 2016, Frontex took measures to improve the efficiency of its internal control systems in the areas of:





Leadership (ICS 7 Operational Structure, ICS 9 Management supervision, ICS 15 Assessment of the internal
control system);
People management (ICS 3 Staff Allocation and Mobility);
Planning and stakeholder cooperation (ICS 5 Objectives and Performance indicators);
Risk management and processes (ICS 8 Processes and Procedures, ICS 11 Document management and ICS
12 Information and communication).

In addition, Frontex has systematically examined the available control results and indicators, including those aimed
to supervise entities to which it has entrusted budget implementation tasks, as well as the observations and
recommendations issued by internal auditors and the European Court of Auditors. These elements have been
assessed to determine their impact on the management's assurance as regards the achievement of control
objectives.
In conclusion, Frontex management has reasonable assurance that Frontex has continued to implement a
comprehensive system of internal controls, performance and results oriented management embedding risk
management and ensuring a proportional approach to compliance and effectiveness of internal procedures and
systems. The necessary improvements and reinforcements have been implemented and the Executive Director, in
his capacity as authorising officer, has signed the Declaration of Assurance.
Nevertheless, Frontex recognises that given the substantial increase in Frontex’ budget (financial and human
resources) and the expansion of the tasks and responsibilities that are assigned to Frontex, the internal control
system must be further strengthened and improved in 2017.

42

4. BUDGETARY AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
In January 2016 Frontex observed an internal reorganisation which constituted three divisions (Operations,
Capacity Building and Corporate Governance) and separate entities reporting directly to the Executive Director.
All expenditures are implemented in the form of centralised management. As a general rule, the Agency uses the
financial circuit model 3 "decentralised circuit with central counterweight", where the operational initiation and
verification functions, as well as the financial initiation function, are executed within each division. The ex-ante
financial verification is centrally performed by the Financial Services within the Financial and Corporate Services
Unit located in Corporate Governance.
For transactions below 5000 EUR, a simplified circuit is followed, where the operational verification function is
performed by the Authorising Officer. For payments below 1000 EUR, a low value transaction circuit is followed,
where both operational and financial verification functions are performed by the Authorising Officer.
For missions, the operational and financial initiation function is performed centrally by staff in the Corporate
Travel Services within Financial and Corporate Services Unit; the operational and financial verification functions
are performed by the relevant Authorising Officer.
The system of delegations and deputising in Frontex respects the following principles:
- Executive Director and Deputy Executive Director are entitled to sign all transactions for all amounts and all
budget lines.
- Delegations are granted by the Executive Director to: Division Directors, Heads of Units, Heads of Sectors and
other selected staff. Different financial thresholds apply to these delegations depending on the position of the AO
(as a general rule: Director – EUR 500.000, other positions - between EUR 5.000 and EUR 200.000).
- Deputising/Suppléances: As a general rule, deputising is performed downwards; which means that Heads of Units
replace Directors, Heads of Sectors replace Heads of Units; Heads of Sectors which are absent are replaced by
another Head of Sector from the same unit or a delegated staff from the sector.

4.2. Information on transfers and amending budgets
The first amendment was proposed to the Management Board in October 2016, following the entry into force of
the European Border and Coast Guard Regulation. In order to start with the implementation of its new and
enhanced mandate additional staff needed to be recruited already during the last quarter of 2016.
A needs assessment identified 50 Temporary Agent posts; subsequently the allocation of the posts was also
proposed for Contract Agents and Seconded National Experts.
Sufficient funds were still available in the Frontex budget 2016 to secure the payments for those staff members,
therefore the 2016 budget amendment N1 adopted by the Management Board on 19 October 2016 with the Decision
no 32/2016 did not increase the financial appropriations.
The Management Board adopted the proposal for the second amendment on 18 November 2016 with the Decision
no 35/2016. In light of the very generous and at the same time ambitious budget allocation in 2016, the revised
forecast showed that despite Frontex having increased its activities and achieving significant improvements
compared with 2015, the budget could not be fully implemented. This shortfall in implementation was mainly due
to political constraints, particularly with regard to return and readmission activities. Furthermore, not all
recruitment procedures could be completed by year-end; this fact, combined with the decrease in the salary
weighting for Poland, led to savings in staff expenditure that could not be absorbed. The amendment resulted in
reducing the budget appropriations by EUR 1.2m in Title 1 and EUR 20.0m in Title 3.

according to Article 27 of the Frontex Financial Regulation.
Within Title 1 one transfer in the amount of EUR 90k was made to safeguard additional financial resources to cover
the increased interim support services in the second half of the year.
The transfers in Title 2 amounted to EUR 2.0m and were necessary to secure funds for expenditure related to
unplanned projects related to the current and new Frontex HQ and other additional expenses resulting from the
increasing number of staff and meetings hosted by Frontex.
In Title 3 transfers of EUR 15.0m were made of which the largest were to cover the needs in logistical support to
the operations (readmission activities and deployment of assets); to increase the capabilities of various operational
activities; and setting up the complaints mechanism;

4.4. Procurement procedures
Overall, 1167 procurement procedures were carried out in 2016 compared with 1137 in 2015. These procedures
were implemented either by launching own tender procedures or using Framework contracts in place concluded
by the Agency or by the Commission.
In 2016, twelve exceptional negotiated procedures were concluded for an overall amount of EUR 3.4m. The reasons
behind the choice of these procedures were either linked to the protection of exclusive rights of the provider, such
as concluding contracts for Microsoft licenses or for the reconstructing works for office space in the Frontex
headquarters to give two examples.
Another reason was the extreme urgency after the entry into force of the EU-Turkey Agreement; as the Greek
authorities could not procure transport services for readmission activities, the Agency needed to step in to ensure
a swift implementation of this political decision made by the European Council. The chair of the Management
Board and the competent European Commissioner were informed by the Executive Director in writing.

4.7.1. HR developments
In 2016, following the adoption of the EBCG Regulation, Frontex resources in the area of budget and staff have
been significantly increased. Anticipating a high workload in this matter, Corporate Governance initiated the work
on the preparation of the HR strategy which was adopted by the Executive Director in December 2016. This
document sets up the new structure of HR service with a main objective to deal with them in more strategic, proactive and efficient way.
Frontex HR services also looked into the possibilities of increased efficiency of recruitment processes. Following
research it was decided to start the implementation of the e-recruitment system which will automate and facilitate
the management of the increased recruitment records. The implementation is foreseen for the beginning of second
quarter of 2017.
In the course of 2016 Frontex continued its cooperation with the Standing Working Party in relation to the model
decision referring to the implementation of certain provisions of the Staff Regulations. Some of the model decision
were implemented, namely on reclassification of contract staff and on reclassification of temporary staff.
Other aspects of HR work worth mentioning, developed in the course of 2016 and aimed for implementation in
2017:
- new traineeship policy,
- new policy on contracts of employment,
- new rules on the seconded national experts
- internal mobility policy,
- working time registration system,
- competency framework,
- start up phase of joining the Sysper 2 project.

4.8.1. Ex-ante controls
The ex-ante controls in the Agency are embedded in the financial circuit of the Agency; the financial ex-ante
verification plays a vital role in the ex-ante controls.
The financial verification is performed on every commitment regardless of the amount and every payment above
EUR 1.000. Commitments verified totalled 3.962 transactions with a value of EUR 280.9m.
Of the 14.100 payment transactions, the financial verification function processed 6.040 transactions (43%)
amounting to EUR 171.9m or 86% of the total value of payments. As of May 2016 four Finance Officers perform the
financial ex-ante verification next to other tasks.

During 2016 Frontex continued its efforts to strengthen the control framework, in particular in the case of joint
operations, pilot projects and return operations. In 2016, Frontex had verified supporting documents substantiating
the request for final payment for 640 grants. The final total amount checked doubled compared with 2015 and

52

reached EUR 60.5m, covering 49% of the total amount granted. The total coverage of expenditure checked in 2016
reached 86%.

4.8.2. Ex-post controls
During 2016, the Agency revised its ex-post control scheme in order to render controls more efficient and the
system in itself more coherent. The revision resulted in a new ED Decision; ex-ante controls are complemented by
ex-post controls carried out in house or at the beneficiaries on the spot; the total annual coverage shall reach
minimum 50% of the amount; Additional ex-post controls performed by another Agency on a mutuality basis is
complementing the scheme. The reference period for selecting the population is set for 01/07/N-1 – 30/06/N. The
controls shall be finalized in due time to include its results into the Annual Activity Report of year N.
Two Member States to which grants had been issued were selected for ex-post controls; these Member States had
not yet been subject to ex-post controls and the coverage through ex-ante controls was low.
The control had the following objectives:
1.
2.
3.

To gain insight into the MS/SAC systems managing activities financed by Frontex aiming to monitor
sound budget implementation in the most effective and cooperative way;
To establish a coherence of the approach towards Frontex reimbursements in case of several
authorities of one MS/SAC participating in Frontex operations,
To provide the Executive Director with additional assurance that effective measures are in place to
avoid double funding.

20 grants were controlled amounting to EUR 0.24m. Both controls resulted in a recovery of EUR 9.501,35, as
systemic errors were detected. The error rate of the ex-post controls was 3.95% of the overall amount granted.
The aforementioned controls at the Beneficiaries were complemented by additional control measures in form of
in-house controls and complemented by controls performed by EIGE Agency within the scope of the a Service Level
Agreement covering the bilateral exchange of experts in order to perform ex-post controls, signed in 2014.
Frontex supported the control exercise in EIGE by checking whether the internal control system ensures the
compliance of the transactions to the financial rules and to internal procedures. EIGE supported Frontex in
performing the control on the validation of user access rights granted in ABAC.
The objective was to resolve any incompatibility between the granted ABAC authorizations and the responsibilities
entrusted to a user. The task was performed in the form of a desk review at EIGE premises. The required
documentation to perform the exercise was the standard security reports downloaded from the ABAC system
together with the relevant decision of Frontex Executive Director regarding the financial circuits, the users and
profiles and, a list with the state of play of all Authorising Officers with the budget lines and threshold values they
are responsible for.
The control resulted in a short report indicating small shortcomings in the rights encoded in ABAC. All detected
inconsistencies were corrected by Frontex and led to the strengthening of the internal control system in house.

5. MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL
Frontex has put in place an organizational structure and internal control system that is suited to the achievement
of its control objectives, in accordance with the standards and having due regard to the risks associated with the
environment in which it operates.
Frontex adopted updated Internal Control Standards based on international good practice, they were approved by
the Management Board on the 25 June 2009. These were inspired by those of the European Commission, and provide
a comprehensive set of standards and guidelines for evaluating and further developing the internal control system
of Frontex. The internal control system is comprised of 16 Internal Control Standards.
Frontex has the process in place to assess the Internal Control Standards what gives reasonable assurance to the
Executive Director, regarding the achievement of Frontex objectives relating to operations, reporting and
compliance.
The assessment is carried out by management, who monitors the functioning of the internal control system on a
continuous basis, and by internal and external auditors. The results are explicitly documented and reported to the
Executive Director. The reports produced are:
•
Declaration of Assurance of the Directors, Heads of Units and where appropriate other subordinate entities
in the hierarchy. These are collected and presented to the Executive Director as input into his own Declaration of
Assurance as the Authorizing Officer.
•

The report on the results of assessment of effectiveness of internal control system.

•

The risk assessment report.

•

The reports on the exceptions.

•

The opinion of the internal auditor (IAS) as expressed in audit report and in its assessment of the
implementation of prior audit recommendations.

•

The opinion and observations of the external auditor of Frontex (European Court of Auditors) and Frontex’
response.

These reports result from a systematic analysis of the evidence available. This approach provides “reasonable
assurance”10 as to the completeness and reliability of the information reported. The control results and other
elements that support management’s assurance are detailed below as follows: Control Results, Audit observations
and recommendations, Assessment of the effectiveness of the internal control system. The inputs are used to
provide the Conclusions as regards the assurance.

5.1. Control Results
Frontex has a set of Internal Control Standards (ICS) in place which specify the necessary requirements, actions
and expectations in order to build an effective system of internal control that can provide reasonable assurance
on the achievement of Frontex’ objectives.
The internal control system also includes a number of internal procedures, for example, guidance on conflicts of
interests, a code of good administrative behaviour, and the procurement procedures. New internal procedures
are introduced when necessary and existing procedures are revised in regular intervals.
In accordance with ICS 8, Frontex has a procedure in place to ensure that overrides of controls or deviations from
established processes and procedures are documented in exception reports, justified, duly approved before action

The control assessment results presented in the internal control assessment report (p. 3.1.1), the report on the
exceptions (p. 3.1.2); the risk assessment report (p. 3.1.3); the report on the implementation of anti-fraud strategy
(p. 3.1.4); audits’ reports (p. 3.2).

5.1.1. Internal Control Assessments
The annual assessment of the internal control system is a critical input into the Executive Director’s Declaration

10

An internal control system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide an absolute guarantee regarding
achievement of an entity’s objectives. This is because of inherent limitations of any control system and the possibility of
deliberate human intervention to circumnavigate controls.

55

of Assurance, that in turn is a required element of the Annual Activity Report.
In assessing the internal controls as of the end of 2016, we modified the assessment process allowing to include
multiple inputs such as

results from the Internal Control Assessment Survey (involving the whole staff);
desk review of documents that provide tangible evidence that the controls are in place;
results of the risk assessment;
audit’s recommendations and improvement actions’ implementation status;
results of the internal control self-assessment workshop.

For each internal control requirement, the level of control and the effectiveness of the control is assessed.
The level of control is mainly determined by findings established in the desk review. Here it is assessed what
documentary evidence for the different internal control requirements (as identified in the Guidelines on measuring
the effectiveness of Internal Control Standards) are in place. The more evidence can be found the higher the level
of control.
The assessment of the effectiveness of control is based on the level of implementation of audit recommendations
and improvement actions, the results of the risk assessment, the outcome of the self-assessment survey and of the
workshop involving the management. Here an average value of all the tools used is created.
The table below provides a numerical summary of the results (a 1-5 scale is used where 1 is low and 5 is high) of
the assessment of the internal controls as of the end of 2016.

The Matrix below relates the level of controls and the effectiveness of control; that enables to assess how efficient
the different controls are.
A very high level of controls (= high level of documented control measures) might still be a weakness in the internal
control system if those controls are not effective (= recognised). Such high level of control could rather create an
obstacle for achieving process efficiency; therefore, it is important to have an appropriate, balanced level of
controls.
The most efficient controls are those having a reasonable (low) level of control achieving a high level of
effectiveness (e.g. ICS 2 and ICS 16).
The least efficient are those having a high level of controls but a low effectiveness (e.g. ICS 3, ICS 7, ICS 8 and
ICS 11). The ICS 1 and ICS 9 are effective, however, having the high level.

Figure 11-The efficiency matrix of the internal control system in 2016

Conclusions and areas for improvement:
Overall the assessment of the controls in place shows that the controls related to accounting and financial
reporting (ICS 13), mission and vision (ICS 1), organisational values (ICS 2), management supervision (ICS 9) and
internal audit (ICS 16) are the strongest.
Some positive developments are to be noticed for the controls related to the objectives (ICS 5) and management
supervision (ICS 9).
2016 shows a decrease in the effectiveness of some controls compared to 2015. This is most visible for ICS 1, as
the controls related to the mission and organisational values had been rated very high (between 4 to 5). This
situation must be seen linked with the changes that are taking place at Frontex such as changes to Frontex mandate
with enhanced and new functions and responsibilities requiring increased and new staffing. Such changes are
related to uncertainty which explains that the assessment of the level of controls related to staff allocation (ICS3)
and organisational structure (ICS 7) remained at relative low level (2). That is the reason why the Executive Director
considers the adoption of a new organisational chart as an urgent priority for the Agency.
The areas for improvement
(i) To realign Frontex organisational structure, roles, and functions with new mandate and objectives;
(ii) To strengthen the Internal Control System by increasing the awareness of the staff, especially
managers;
(iii) To update Frontex Mission, Vision and Values in line with new Frontex mandate;
(iv) To strengthen HR related processes, especially those related to staff selection and motivation.
(v) To strengthen Risk management process at unit level.
(vi) To revise Business Continuity plans.

57

(vii) To define Frontex communication process in line with the communication strategy.

5.1.2. Register of Exceptions - Overview of 2016
Having regard to the Financial Regulation, and in particular Article 30(3) and 44(2) thereof Frontex records
exceptions in a “Register of Exceptions” in line with the ED’s Policy on Recording and Monitoring Exceptions. During
2016 such exceptions were recorded in the register of exceptions, these were monitored and periodically analysed
and reported along with recommendations for reducing the exceptions.
Based on the new “Procedure for recording and monitoring of the exceptions” (ED Decision 2015/88 12.11.2015)
which entered into the force on 1 January 2016, the structure of the register was slightly changed. The level of
‘financial materiality’ was raised from 1.000 to 5.000 Euros, balanced by the requirement for an exception to be
signed by the ‘reporting’ officer instead of the authorising officer him/herself.
The relevant regulatory framework is set by:







European Border and Coast Guard Regulation,
(Frontex) Financial Regulation and implementing rules,
Staff and SNE rules,
Procurement procedures,
Contractual obligations, and
Internal procedures.

During 2016 a total of 124 exceptions were registered amounting to 8.358.939 EUR.
The tendency for the period 2011-2016 showed an increase in the absolute number of exceptions and the amount
covered (Figure 5 and 6 below). However, the ratio (percentage %) of the amount covered by the exceptions and
the total payment made during a given period, still showed a decreasing trend (Figure 7).
Ratio is an indicator that supports the measurement of the effectiveness of the controls related to exceptions and
makes the annual comparison more objective.

73% of the amount covered by exceptions was related to non-compliance with procurement procedures. Those
exceptions were required to swiftly implement the EU/Turkey agreement or in anticipation of the new and
enhanced mandate. As justifications urgent operational needs, technical reason and the need to avoid the gaps in
material support for readmission activities in Greece were provided. It can be summarised that the situation during
2016 is a clear indication that for an EU law enforcement entity as Frontex such procedures don’t stand the reality
test in exceptional and crisis situations.

15 exceptions (which is 12% of total number of exceptions registered in 2016) accumulate to an amount of
6.947.089 EUR, representing 83% of total amount covered by exceptions in 2016. Those are mostly exceptions
related to the non-compliance with procurement procedures and financial rules – ex-post commitment. As outlined
before, those exception served the swift implementation of the EU/Turkey agreement or the anticipated
application of the new and enhanced mandate. The Chair of the Management Board and the competent European
Commissioner were informed in real time by a letter from the Executive Director explaining the circumstances of
the exceptions aiming at swift readmission operations from Greek islands to Turkey as decided by the European
Council.

5.1.3. Risk Assessments
Frontex has in place a process where each year the top corporate risks that could impact the achievement of the
Programme of Work are identified and monitored; if necessary, mitigating actions are taken.
At the corporate Level, a continuous follow-up on the five top risks identified in 2015 was executed; a description
of those risks is provided below:

11

1.

Frontex’ ability to comply with Article 25 FX Regulation
The increased political interest and external decisions might impact on Frontex’ ability to fully comply
with Article 25 of the FX Regulation11 and to achieve its mission.
Mitigation measures: to continue to build political support amongst key stakeholder; MSs, EU bodies,
etc.; clear communication of our mandate and role and of the need to ensure the integrity thereof;
monitoring events and identifying trends, then taking appropriate action.

2.

Unbalanced/increased stakeholder expectations
Macro changes such as shifts in migration pressure can result in increased/unbalanced stakeholder
expectations; some of them even outside the current legal framework; additionally, Frontex’ stakeholders
have different & often competing expectations for our products & services.
Mitigation measures: repetition of and focus on core message (focus on products and services in the PoW);
systematic review of expectations and changes to PoW, including de-prioritising activities where
necessary.

3.

Management of Governance risks
Frontex role and the role of other external entities is modified or expanded, negatively impacting on
Frontex’ ability to achieve agreed core responsibilities.
Mitigation measures: monitoring and reporting on developments and making sure our role is understood
and accepted.

Art 25 of the Frontex Regulation in place until 5 October 2016.

60

4.

Suboptimal use of human & financial resources
The need for rapidly expanding resource allocation (money and people) and our ability to ensure proper
use of resources is hampered by existing deficits regarding mobility of staff.
Mitigation measures: careful planning and allocation of resources, improved monitoring of POW
deliverables & budget, transparent communication to stakeholders and staff.

5.

Reputational Damage
Continued misunderstanding of Frontex’ role (expectations) can damage the reputation of the Agency,
further leading to loss of political support impacting on ability to perform function
Mitigation measures: continue to sharpen and communicate our core message on our role, improve
support and use of the liaison function in Brussels, monitor events and ensure clear communication of
roles and responsibilities.

These corporate risks were formally reviewed in the monthly Cross-Divisional meetings chaired by the Executive
Director, more specific mitigating actions were identified and responsibilities for actions was assigned if
appropriate.
In addition, managers are responsible for identifying risks for the activities in the PoW and for managing these risks
to ensure products and services are delivered as planned. Those main risks were identified at units’ level:
•
Improper reporting: Missing and/or incorrect information/data, or correct information/data not
provided in time.
•
Reduced collaboration by third countries: Replacement of third-countries' personnel in migration
offices or at diplomatic representations in Member States may lead to a decrease or suspension of
operational cooperation the field of return policy with Member States.
•
Political changes in third countries: Changes in a third country negatively affecting the respect for
fundamental rights would lead to the suspension of joint return operations to such a country.
•
Strategic, policy and legal developments in the EU: Changes in strategic, policy and legal areas in the
EU could heavily influence the activities of the Agency.
•
Internal Decision Making: Lack of coordination and consultation during the internal decision making
process, units not duly involved can be detrimental for the interests of the Agency.

5.1.4. Anti- Fraud Strategy Implementation
Frontex’ Anti-Fraud Strategy and Action Plan was presented in the 55th Management Board meeting. Based on the
comments received the document was revised. In the 56th Management Board meeting it was decided to submit
the revised document for adoption in written procedure. Frontex’ Anti-Fraud Strategy and Action Plan was adopted
in written procedure on 17 December 2015 (Decision No.56/2015).
Frontex’ Anti-Fraud Strategy and Action Plan identifies 4 strategic objectives with 22 actions to be implemented
during the period 2015-2018. During 2016 more than 50% of the actions identified were implemented.
During the reporting period no cases were transmitted to the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and/or the
Commission Investigating and Disciplinary Office (IDOC) for investigation.

5.1.5 Ex Post Controls – see Ex Post Controls under II.2.7

5.1.6 Declaration of Assurance Process
Each year the Authorising Officer (Executive Director of Frontex) provides a Declaration of Assurance on the control
system. This Declaration concludes that Frontex Executive Director has reasonable assurance12 that the resources
assigned to the activities in the Annual Activity Report have been used for their intended purpose and in accordance
with the principles of sound financial management 13, and that the internal control system put in place gives

12

An internal control system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide an absolute guarantee regarding
achievement of an entity’s objectives. This is because of inherent limitations of any control system and the possibility of
deliberate human intervention to circumnavigate controls.

13

In accordance with the principles of economy, efficiency and effectiveness, see Article 29 of Frontex Financial Regulation,
Management Board Decision No. 01/2014 of 8 January 2014.

61

reasonable assurance concerning the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions.
This reasonable assurance is based on the Executive Director’s (ED’s) own judgement of the information at his
disposal such as the reports of the annual assessment of the internal control system, ex-ante and ex-post controls,
the findings and observations of the Internal Audit Service and the European Court of Auditors for years prior to
the year of this declaration.
In order to strengthen the basis on which the ED’s Declaration is signed each Director, Head of Unit and others (as
may deemed necessary) sign a Declaration of Assurance for their area of responsibility and provide the declarations
to the Executive Director. This helps to ensure accountability, to reinforce the internal control system and to
ensure the declaration of assurance process is complete.

5.2. Audit observations and recommendations
5.2.1 European Court of Auditors (ECA)
The European Court of Auditors is required to provide its final opinion on the accounts of Frontex “no later than 1
June of the following year”. Therefore, the ECA’s opinion on Frontex’ accounts for 2016 was not available at the
time the CAAR 2016 was prepared. The opinion of the ECA on Frontex’ accounts for the year ending 2015 is provided
below as this sheds some light on the adequacy of the internal control system.
“Basis for qualified opinion on the reliability of the accounts
9. The Agency underestimated the cost incurred in 2015 but not yet invoiced for prefinanced services related to
maritime surveillance by 1 723 336 euro. This underestimation affected the accrued charges and resulted in a
material misstatement in the Agency’s balance sheet and statement of financial performance.
Qualified opinion on the reliability of the accounts
10. In the Court’s opinion, except for the effects of the matter described in the Basis for Qualified Opinion
paragraph, the Agency’s annual accounts present fairly, in all material respects, its financial position as at 31
December 2015 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with
the provisions of its Financial Regulation and the accounting rules adopted by the Commission’s accounting
officer.
Opinion on the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the accounts
11. In the Court’s opinion, the transactions underlying the annual accounts for the year ended 31 December 2015
are legal and regular in all material respects.
12. The comments which follow do not call the Court’s opinions into question.
COMMENTS ON THE LEGALITIY AND REGULARITY OF TRANSACTIONS
13. The ex-post audit to Iceland carried out by the Agency in October 2015 detected irregular payments totalling
1.4 million euro related to the depreciation of a vessel participating in seven joint operations from 2011 to
2015. The Icelandic coast guard had claimed reimbursement of depreciation for that vessel even though it had
exceeded the useful life provided for in the Agency’s guidelines. Whilst the Agency has the right to recover
irregular payments made in the last five years, it announced to recover only the payments made since January
2015, amounting to 0.6 million euro.
14. The Internal Security Fund (ISF) is set up for the period 2014-20. It is composed of two instruments, ISF Borders
and Visa as well as ISF Police, under which 2,8 billion euro and 1 billion euro are available for funding actions
respectively. The Commission under ISF Borders and Visa reimburses Member States’ purchases of means, such
as vehicles or vessels as well as running costs such as fuel consumption or maintenance. The Agency also
reimburses such costs to participants in joint operations. There is therefore an unaddressed risk of double
funding14.

14

The Court had referred to this risk in paragraph 39 and recommendation 4 of its Special Report 15/2014 ‘The External Borders
Fund has fostered financial solidarity but requires better measurement of results and needs to provide further EU added
value’.

62

COMMENTS ON BUDGETARY MANAGEMENT
15. The level of carry-overs for committed appropriations was high for Title II (administrative expenditure) at 3,2
million euro, i.e. 38 % (2014: 4,5 million euro, i.e. 36 %) and Title III (operational expenditure) at 40,2 million
euro, i.e. 35 % (2014: 28,4 million euro, i.e. 44 %). For Title II, the main reason for high carry-overs is IT
contracts extending beyond the year-end whereas for Title III, it is the multiannual nature of the Agency’s
operations.
OTHER COMMENTS
16. States participating in border operations declare the costs incurred on the basis of cost claim sheets which
comprise “fixed expenses” (depreciation and maintenance), “variable expenses” (mostly fuel) and “mission
expenses” (mostly allowances and other crew expenses). The costs declared are based on real values and follow
national standards leading to divergent approaches among participating states which creates a particularly
burdensome system for all parties involved. The Court in its Special Report 12/2016 recommended that agencies
should use simplified cost options whenever appropriate to avoid such inefficiencies 15.”16
Frontex has taken note of the ECA comments and will make improvements where necessary.

5.2.2. Discharge authorities’ (European Parliament) Observations and measures
taken by Frontex17
The European Parliament granted discharge to Frontex in respect of the implementation of the Agency’s budget
for the financial year 2014. The main areas in which the European Parliament made observations are listed below.
1.
2.
3.

Comments on the legality and regularity of transactions
Procurement and recruitment procedures
Prevention and management of conflicts of interests and transparency

Frontex has taken the measures in the lights of the Discharge Authority’s recommendations. Summary points,
which relate to the observations made by the discharge authority’s recommendations, are provided below:
1. Frontex is further strengthening its internal control system by improving the controls in prevention and
management of conflict of interests and increased the transparency by:








Continues publishing information on procurement procedures in 2014 in line with the requirements stemming
from its Financial regulation; the Agency publishes the necessary information since it took up work in 2005;
Publishing declarations of absence of the conflict of interest of ED and DED on the Frontex website;
Finalizing the implementation of whistleblowing rules;
Raising awareness of the conflict-of-interest policy among its staff;
Implementing a set of actions for an overall improvement in the prevention of, and the fight against,
corruption;
Introducing enhanced training on the Code of Conduct for all participants in Frontex Activities;
Applying “relevant measures” strictly in order to protect the financial interest of the Union.

2. Financial processes have been improved by revising the scheme for the participation of UK and Ireland in Frontex
activities and updating the calculation method for the financial contribution of Schengen Associated countries.
Furthermore the functioning of the delegation of authority has been subject to an ex-post control and currently a
revised version aiming at increasing the efficiency of the delegation system is under preparation;
3. Initial steps have been taken to review the financing mechanism and possibly to render it more efficient after
the adoption of the Regulation on European Border and Coast Guard which offers the possibility of using various
financing instruments for financing operational activities;

208–213;

17

Given the timing of the ECA work, their observations relate to 2014. The discharge for the 2015 accounts is not expected until
May 2017. Therefore the ECA Observations and Frontex’ response for 2014 are included in this report as this provides
information on the adequacy of the internal control system.

63

4. From March 2016 Frontex has been working with the Polish authorities to establish a comprehensive
Headquarters agreement. As the new Regulation on European Border and Coast Guard introduces a deadline of six
months after the entry into force of the Regulation for the conclusion of the Headquarters Agreement, its adoption
by Frontex Management Board was scheduled for February 2017.

5.2.3 Audits - Internal Audit Service (IAS)
During 2016 the audit on "Data Validation and Quality Assurance for the Risk Analysis" was completed. The final
report received on 6 September 2016 and subsequently the Action Plan was developed and sent mid October 2016.
The objective of the audit were:



compliance of the Agency's risk analysis activity with the applicable regulatory framework;
the efficiency and effectiveness of the processes and controls in place that ensure the quality of the risk
analysis, in particular the quality of the data on which the risk analysis is based and the quality of the
deliverables resulting from it.

The Conclusions and findings:
With respect to the first objective related to the compliance of the risk analysis activity with the applicable
regulatory framework, the IAS concluded that the application of the CIRAM ensures that Frontex is compliant with
the regulatory framework.
With respect to the second objective related to efficiency and effectiveness of the processes and controls in place,
whilst the audit team did not identify any critical or very important issues, room for further improvement had
been identified in four areas:
1.
2.
3.
4.

strengthening of the exchange of data between the Member States and the Agency;
establishing and implementing a strategy for further consolidation and automation of data processing;
finalisation of process descriptions in respect of each RAU product;
improving the processes to deal with ad-hoc requests.

The report included four important recommendations:
Recommendation 1: Review, upgrade and formalise where necessary the arrangements that exist between the
Agency and the MSs in respect of bilateral data exchange responsibilities and roles.
Recommendation 2: Establish and implement a strategy for further consolidation and automation in data
processing and validation.
Recommendation 3: Follow and document the 'validation' levels at key stages of the approved and disseminated
product process descriptions
Recommendation 4: Adopt processes to deal with ad-hoc requests guaranteeing the quality of RAU deliverables,
assess and introduce relevant mitigating measures to counter high staff turnover that has a negative impact on
processes related to risk analysis and reduce reliance on short-term secondments of essential staff from Member
States

No recommendations rated as 'critical' were issued during the year 2016 and therefore there are no open
recommendations rated as 'critical'.
By the end of 2016 the Agency has continued to provide evidence of implementation achieving the successful
closure of the open recommendations. The status of implementation of Audit’s recommendations during 2016

5.3. Assessment of the effectiveness of the internal
control system
As described before Frontex has adopted a set of internal control standards, based on international good practice,
aimed to ensure the achievement of its objectives. Frontex sets up a process for assessment of the Internal control
system and constantly makes improvements in order to strengthen the standard and increase the efficiency of
their application.
The following improvements areas have been addressed in 2016:
Staff Allocation and Mobility (ICS 3): Frontex has been working on the implementation of IAS recommendations
related to the recruitment process: to enhance HR guidance; to strength the justification and documentation of
the recruitment; to enhance the efficiency of the recruitment process.
Objectives & Performance Indicators (ICS 5): In 2016 we were working further on improvement of staffs’
understanding of the link between objectives in Multi-Annual Plan and the Programme of Work and their objectives.
Management supervision (ICS 9): tools developed in 2015 to support management in managing risks used for the
PoW 2016 Activities. This helped ensure managers are able to focus on “high risk areas”. This is particularly
important as the increased work load and the changes in new legislation impact our ability to deliver products and
services. The improvement have been made in the area of potential conflict of interest in line with the Anti-fraud
strategy.
Assessment of the internal control system (ICS 15): In 2016 we have further developed and improved the new
method for assessing the effectiveness of internal controls piloted in 2015.
Document Management (ICS 11): work on the implementation of Document Management System continues during
2016. The Document Management Officer appointed in 2016 to streamline the work done.
Processes and Procedures (ICS 8): Work on documenting the processes continued in 2016, supporting our efforts to
streamline processes and be an important input into developing the Document Management System. The processes
were prioritised and the most critical ones should be included in the first phase of the workflow automation.
At the beginning of 2017 Frontex assessed the effectiveness of its internal control system as of the end of 2016.
The results are presented above under II.3.1.1. Our conclusion is that the internal control standards are
implemented and functioning. However, given the very large increase in the budget allocation to Frontex (financial
and human resources) Frontex recognizes that there will be an additional strain on the internal control system and
that improvements must be made.

65

5.4. Conclusions as Regards Assurance
Based on the internal control results and the results of the Declaration of Assurance process Frontex concludes
that overall the internal control standards are functioning effectively. However, as described above there are
areas where improvement is needed, this is especially important given that there will be considerable increases in
both financial and human resources until 2020. Since the entry into force of its new regulation on 6 October 2016
Frontex is now the ‘European Border and Coast Guard Agency’. As a result, significant changes in the mandate of
the Agency will impact on its activities, its internal organization and the way it interacts with Member States and
external stakeholders. It is anticipated that these changes will put a major strain on the internal control system.
The information reported above stems from the results of internal control assessment processes and audits
monitoring contained in the reports listed above. These reports result from a systematic analysis of the evidence
available. This approach provides sufficient guarantees as to the completeness and reliability of the information
reported and results in a comprehensive coverage of the Frontex’ budget.
Reviewing the elements supporting the assurance as described about and the evidence as presented in this Annual
Activity Report some control weaknesses (areas for improvement) were identified. However, these control
weaknesses do not rise to the level of a “reservations”.
Overall Conclusion
In conclusion, management has reasonable assurance that, overall, suitable controls are in place and working as
intended; risks are being appropriately monitored and mitigated; and necessary improvements and reinforcements
are being implemented. The Executive Director, in his capacity as Authorising Officer has signed the Declaration
of Assurance albeit recognizing that improvement actions need to be taken especially in light of the number and
sizes of changes the Agency underwent during 2016 and will further undergo in 2017.

ANNEXES to Chapters 1 to 3
ANNEX 1. Comparative analysis of joint and return
operations in 2016
Activities at the external land borders
In response to the challenges faced in the border management of the external land borders, four Joint Operations
(JO) were launched.
JO Focal Points 2016 Land was implemented at 46 Focal Points launched as a follow-up of JO Focal Points 2015.
Compared to 2015, eight new Focal Points were established. Enhanced exchange of information was established
between the Police and Customs Cooperation Centers (PCCCs) and Focal Points, in the framework of JO Focal
Points 2016 Land.
Four Member States hosted the operation (Bulgaria, Greece, Croatia and Hungary) hosted JO Flexible Operational
Activities 2016 on border surveillance as a follow-up of the JO Flexible Operational Activities 2015. Noteworthy
new element was the deployment of human resources and technical equipment along the Bulgaria-Serbia border
in addition to the significantly enhanced support at the Bulgaria-Turkey border.
JO Coordination Points 2016 was implemented in seven third countries (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Serbia and Ukraine) where 18 Member States / Schengen
Associated Countries (MSs/SACs) deployed 69 experts at eight Coordination Points.
JO Flexible Operational activities 2016 on Border Checks was implemented for the first time in 2016 at 22 selected
Focal Points, based on the 2015 Project Joined Border Check Teams.
The overall number of operational days in 2016 increased considerably compared to 2015, with 1316 days in 2016,
compared to 1011 days in 2015.
The number of hosting MS/SAC (16) increased with four and the number of participating MS/SAC (28) increased
with one compared to 2015, while in terms of third countries there was two additional hosting third countries (7
in total).
Deployed experts performed 80,389 man days, as compared to 73,318 man days in 2015, an increase of more than
11 %.
In 2016, the land borders budget for joint operations was increased to EUR 14,700,000.00 (an increase of more
than EUR 5 million from the EUR 9,327,975 in 2015), resulting in a higher volume of activity.

Activities at the external sea borders
Frontex has utilised operational platform aiming to support host Member State by sharing the burden at the mostly
effected maritime border as well as to facilitate interoperability and flexible response to the irregular migration
phenomena and cross-border crime. In this regard six joint maritime operations and several tailored activities, as
well as facilitation of national patrolling in predefined European Patrol Network (EPN) areas were implemented in
2016.
The number of operational days in sea operations in 2016 decreased slightly by 27 % (1,153 in 2016 versus 1,584 in
2015), due to the fact that JOs hosted by Spain due to non-operational reasons had to be delayed.
In 2016, Frontex continued increased budget allocations for joint maritime operations resulting in the biggest
volume of operational activities in Frontex history. This corresponded to the increased number of guest officers
deployed in maritime operations especially in the hotspot locations.
Deployed experts performed some 290% more operational man-days in comparison to 2015 (155,000 compared to
40,000). From all deployed officers only 1% were consisted by Seconded Guest Officers. In addition, during the
maritime joint operations, crewmembers performed 127,000 operational man-days, 112% more compared to the
previous year (60,000 in 2015). As regards the gender balance 14% females and 86% males were representing
Member States’ experts in JOs. Finally, approximately 74 000 operational man-days of coordinating staff provided
by the host countries contributed to successful implementation of the operational activities.
The number of participating MS/SAC in joint sea operations remained stable, 30 Member States, in comparison to
previous year. There were also six third countries involved in sea operations in 2016, two more than in 2015.

69

With regard to financing of the operation activities, the budget for the year 2016 was 107,000,000 EUR compared
to previous year allocation of EUR 70,400,129. This increase has demonstrated not only the increase of workload
related to financial transactions but also in cost effective management of the assets and human resources.
In 2016, there was a sharp drop to arrival by sea to EU, thus total, 369,645 migrants were intercepted during the
joint maritime operations in contrast to 972,422, which represents 62% decrease compared to 2015. The migration
pressure in 2016 was equally shared among two main operational areas in Eastern Mediterranean area represented
185,944 migrants arrived to Greece during sea operations in 2016 which is huge decrease compared to 811,541 in
2015. In addition to that 178,961 migrants were registered in JO Triton in the Central Mediterranean which is
increase compared to the results of the 2015 (155,000 in 2015).
Furthermore, 1,020 suspected facilitators were apprehended during the joint maritime operations – slightly less
(13%) compered than the previous year’s total of 1,166. This is still important achievement considering proportion
of arriving migrants to the EU via sea.
During Frontex coordinated maritime operations there were 2,669 SAR cases registered which represent slight
decrease of 25% (3,556 in 2015) and the high volume compared to the proportion of the total number of migrants
arrived via sea in 2016.
With the new regulation which come into force on 6 October Frontex also put more emphasis on interagency
cooperation related to various illicit activities at maritime domain. During the maritime joint operations, several
cross-border crimes, including drug trafficking were detected.
Some 80 tonnes of hashish worth more than EUR 120 million (vs. 106 tons worth EUR 160 million) plus 1.7 tons of
cocaine worth EUR 103 million (vs. 35 kg worth EUR 2 million), as well as 13.8 tons of marihuana worth EUR 20
million (vs. 5.4 kg worth EUR 1.3 million) were seized.
Most of the drugs were seized in the Western and Central Mediterranean area.
Moreover, 14,000,000 contraband cigarettes worth EUR 3.2 million were also seized in 2016 (compared to 336
million in 2015).
European cooperation on coast guard functions was notably enhanced within the umbrella of the tailored Pilot
Project. The Pilot Project “Creation of a European coastguard function” was meant to enhance cooperation of
coast guard functions in the EU, as well as to test practical cooperation among agencies as part of the European
Parliament’s Priority Actions. There were several positive developments achieved during the pilot project:
Operational Plans of all joint maritime operations were amended incorporating closer interagency cooperation,
also special operational procedure has been developed.
In 2016 EFCA has received close to 600 fishing sighting forms from assets deployed in Frontex operations. Several
operational tailored briefings were performed by EFCA to Frontex deployed crews as well as Frontex representative
updated EFCA representatives about particularities of border control missions. For the first time in Frontex history
EFCA fisheries inspector joined common patrol in JO Triton, consequently several other airborne and seaborne
common missions were performed in 2016 in JOs Triton Poseidon and Indalo.
In addition to that nine possible sea pollution cases were detected and reported to national authorities in the
Central Mediterranean Sea area JO Triton.

Activities at the external air borders
The intensity of operational activities at the EU external air borders were enhanced and the number of man-days
of air border joint operations increased by 8,7 % from 8,779 man-days in 2015 to 9,546 man-days in 2016. It is
mainly due to the continuous and long term deployment of 18 SGOs in the operational areas.
In 2015, six joint operations were carried out for a total of 1,169 operational days, while in 2015 the air border
operational activities were implemented under the umbrella of five joint operations for 952 operational days in
total.
The number of deployed officers was 16 % lower (317 in 2015 / 266 in 2016). However, the duration of deployments
was extended especially in the case of SGO deployments.
The number of participating MS/SAC remained very high (28 in 2016 / 29 in 2015) and additional 12 third countries
(11 in 2015) took part in joint operations by hosting operational activities and/or deploying 45 third country
observers in total.
Similarly to the previous years the participation at the Operational Heads of Airports Conference remained very
high as 80 MS/SAC and 19 third country airports were represented by their Border Guards Commanders or senior
delegates which indicates the continuous high interest and need for this annual meeting. In addition, seven
international or partner organizations took also part at this conference.

70

In 2016, the budget of Air Border operational activities was increased by 22% to 3,144.443 EUR (2015 = 2,580,000
EUR) to cover the costs of activities.

Return activities
In 2016 Frontex assisted 232 Return Operation (+251% comparing with the operation assisted in 2015) returning in
total 10,698 people. The budget committed for Joint Return Operations in 2016 was EUR 30,538,732.44.
The Agency started to support MSs in the implementation of national return operations even before that the new
regulation entered into force. Given the enormous migratory pressure that the MSs were facing in 2016, and in line
with the EU Action Plan for return of October 2015, Frontex’ Executive Director of the Agency adopted Decision
2016/36, which provided a broader interpretation of art. 9 of the former Frontex regulation (the Agency “… shall
provide the necessary assistance for organising joint return operations of Member States…”): according to it, a
joint return operation was intended also as a:
-

Return operations where there is an element of connection between two Member States;

-

Return operations from the identified hotspots locations, or from just one MS facing a disproportionate number
of persons staying irregularly in its territory due to a specific and disproportionate migratory pressure at the
external borders, as they serve a common interest of all EU MS;

-

Collecting Joint Return Operations.

The “Collecting Joint Return Operations” concept, where escorts and aircraft used to collect irregular migrants in
a Member State and return them to their country of origin are from the Third country of return, was developed
already in 2015. Nevertheless, in 2016 the number of Collecting Return Operations coordinated by Frontex
increased up to 17. The destination countries were Georgia, Albania and Serbia.
Compared to 2015, there were many new third countries of return reached for the first time by return operations
coordinated by the Agency, namely Afghanistan, Egypt, Guinea, Lebanon, Montenegro, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Sudan,
Tunisia and Turkey.
The Agency also provided a dedicated assistance to specific MS such as Greece where gap analysis indicated that
a lack of available funding and the absence of a framework contract for charter aircraft had a direct impact on
the effective return of irregular migrants. Alternatives to facilitate Greek participation on flights and organisation
of JROs were successfully explored, agreed and implemented: for example return operations organized by other
MS to Pakistan, Georgia and Nigeria were carried out including a stopover in Athens to board on the spot the
returnees from Greece.
Furthermore, Frontex launched a call for support to Member States and quickly negotiated arrangements with
Denmark, Austria, Belgium and Norway to charter aircrafts for Greece and other MS in need (Italy for flights to
Nigeria) to carry out return operations.
Based on the EU- Turkey statement, in 2016 Frontex started also to assist Greece for the organization and
implementation of readmission operations to Turkey: from 04.04.2016 until 31.12.2016, 35 operations were
implemented, 11 conducted by air to Adana (114 Syrian nationals) and 24 by ferry (794 third country nationals).
In 2016 Frontex has implemented the “Rolling Operational Plan” on return support activities by using the newly
developed web-based Frontex Application for Return (FAR), launched on 7 October 2016, in order to be able to
better coordinate return operations, collect Member States’ needs for assistance, and ensure that Member States’
requests can be implemented in a more efficient and user-friendly way.
Frontex’ broadened mandate on return led to the establishment of a new Pre-return Activities Network (PRAN).
The enhanced activities of Frontex in the field of pre-return assistance and a detected need for having a respective
network for dealing with pre-return matters led to the need of establishing this network. The intention of Frontex
was to establish the PRAN network as a single network of communication for all pre-return related activities, such
as invitations for meetings, third country identification missions, activities of EU-programmes, inquiries etc. The
main objective is to keep the form of the PRAN meetings interactive and promote the involvement of all members
in its activities.
Within Flexible Operational Activities in Return support was provided in particular to Greece, Italy and Bulgaria:
-

deployments of specialists/experts to Greece to foster practical cooperation with third country consular
staff;
National Return Office model was developed specifically for Greece;
Frontex commenced the assessment of needs and the draft requirements for a Greek national return case
management system;
Greece was supported in drafting operational procedures for the bio-metric identification of Pakistani
irregular migrants;
training of escorts in Greece and Bulgaria;

71

procurement training for travel service contracts provided specifically for Greece with the participation
of Bulgaria;
support of long-term deployments of third-country experts assisting Italy in identification process;
two workshops aimed at the organisation of return operations to Afghanistan;
workshop on returns by air and sea to key third countries, and
using important third country airport hubs for transit with scheduled returns.
In the third quarter of 2016 Frontex launched the phase-in/out process with the EU-funded programmes on return
(Eurint and EURLO), with support of the European Commission.
-

Best Practices for the organisation of return operations to Nigeria were revised together with the Nigerian
representatives in September 2016.

ANNEX 2. Annual report on public access to documents
in 2016
This annual report on access to documents is drawn up in accordance with Article 17(1) of Regulation (EC) No
1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European
Parliament, Council and Commission documents. It covers the period from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2016
and is based on statistical data summarized in the tables below.
Frontex is subject to Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 when handling applications for access to documents held by it,
by means of Article 74(1) of the European Border and Coast Guard Regulation.
The practical arrangements for the application in Frontex of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001, are laid down in
Management Board Decision No 25/2016 of 21 September 2016, a decision adopted pursuant to Article 74(3) of the
European Border and Coast Guard Regulation. Moreover, Decision No 2016/119 of the Executive Director of Frontex
creates a ‘Transparency Office’ and a network of case-handlers across the Agency to handle applications for access
to documents.
Initial applications received by Frontex are handled by the Transparency Office housed within the Legal Affairs
Unit (LAU), in cooperation with the appointed case-handlers from the Frontex entities responsible for the
documents requested each time. Confirmatory applications are handled by LAU. Frontex decides on a case-by-case
basis and either grants full access to the document(s), partial access, or refuses access. The latter two are based
on the exceptions provided under Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001.
Access to Frontex documents in 2016
In 2016 Frontex received applications for access to documents concerning some 725 documents.

Partial Access and refusals were in the vast majority of cases based on:
Article 4(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 - Protection of the public interest as regards public security
of the Community or a Member State.
Article 4(1)(b) Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 - Protection of the privacy and the integrity of the individual, in
particular in accordance with Community legislation regarding the protection of personal data.
Document inexistent/not held by Frontex.
The most common applications for access in 2016 related to Serious Incident Reports from Frontex operations.
Others included requests for access to Operational Plans, Evaluation Reports and minutes from several meetings
held.
Most applicants were said to be academics (students, researchers and professors) and journalists. A large part of
the applicants did not however state their function.
In the year 2016, Frontex also reviewed its internal rules implementing Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 and the
Frontex Management Board adopted Decision No 25/2016 of 21 September 2016 in order to simplify its procedures
in-house, thereby increasing transparency and providing access to documents in a more efficient manner.

73

Finally, in 2016 Frontex saw a slight increase in applications compared with the year 2015 (60 requests). Just like
in the previous year, applications often contained several and complex sub-requests, amounting often to a request
for a very large number of documents. Extension of the deadline was requested by Frontex in 9 out of 67
applications.

Organisational Structure

Figure 10 – Organisational Structure as of January 2016

As of January 2016, Frontex had a new structure in place where the main modifications are related to:
creation of two new units:
1. Return Support Unit, within the Operations Division;
2. Third Countries and EU Cooperation Unit, within the Capacity Building Division.
former Executive Support was streamlined and reduced to a Cabinet; all other functions were reallocated
(see above in the organisational chart e.g. Data Protection Office, Liaison Office, PRESS Office) and
the names of three entities were changed:
1. Corporate Governance (formerly: Administration Division),
2. Finance and Corporate Services Unit (formerly: Finance and Procurement Unit),
3. Human Resources and Security Unit (formerly: Human Resources and Services Unit).
With the new European Border and Coast Guard Regulation which entered into force on 6 October 2016, the new
mandate of Frontex, together with the increasing human and financial resources required to review the

Differences in the tables above might appear due to the fact that during the duration of an employment contract staff
members have been reclassified. Those reclassifications are shown in the columns titled “Filled as of 31/12/2016”.
This reclassification does not have an impact on the posts authorised under the EU budget because those positions are
referring to ‘start grade’ of a post.

The general aim of this concept is to
further develop and intensify the
implementation of multipurpose
operational
concepts,
further
develop the operational activities at
air, sea and land borders as
permanent platforms for providing
sustaining operational presence and
information exchange/gathering in
areas exposed to specific and
disproportionate
pressure,
for
reinforcement at external borders
when
needed
by
Flexible
Operational Activities and to work
as a platform for strengthening the
interagency cooperation and gaining
border related intelligence.

Under Focal Points
concept
the
following
operational
activities will be
implemented:

LAND:
JO Focal Points Land was launched on 3 February as a
follow-up of JO FP 2015. During the operation 46 Focal
Points were activated.
Compared to 2015, 8 new Focal Points were
established.
JO hosted the deployment of 30 TC observers from 9
different countries.
Enhanced exchange of information between the
Police and Customs Cooperation Centres (PCCCs) and
Focal Points was noted.
Action Danube organised under the umbrella of EU
policy cycle/EMPACT and co-led by Frontex and
Hungary was implemented in close cooperation with
EU Member States, Europol and Interpol.
Deployment of Guest Officers at the selected 8 FPs
and intensified checks of the passengers and cars in
the frame of EMPACT Joint Action Day WB OA 2.1. On
the counteraction of firearms trafficking was
implemented.
Focal Points Staff Exchange was launched with the
aim to enhance the cooperation and exchange of
information as well as best practices among the Focal
Points.

JO Coordination Points was implemented between 08
March and 13 December 2016 in 7 Third Countries
(ALB, BIH, FYROM, MDA, MNE, SRB and UKR). 18
MSs/SACs deployed 69 experts (profile ALDO/SVDO) as
observers in 8 CPs.
Effective practical cooperation and networking
between the local coordinators of JO FPs and CPs was
in place aiming at gaining experience and mutual
exchange of information and best practices.

Low risk of limited MS interest in

and
deployment
was
partially
mitigated by launching the 5th
additional extraordinary SGO
Call for 2016. However, the
scope of MS response was not
sufficient.

according
to
recommendations resulting from
short/mid-term risk analysis reports
delivered throughout the year, in
order to respond in an effective and
accurate manner to threats at the
external borders of the EU. Focal
Points can also be activated upon
justification based on the MS
national risk analysis as well as
Frontex risk analysis.

deployments based on bilateral
agreements were preferred by
MS instead of deployments in the
frame of Frontex JOs) was
partially
mitigated
by
continuous requests via Open

Focal Points concept will also cover
Flexible
Operational
Activities
focusing on the green border
surveillance,
debriefing
and
screening activities and additionally
ensuring increased border checks
capacities in BCPs.

4 MSs hosted the operation (BGR, GRC, HRV and HUN).
Noteworthy new element was the deployment of HR
and TE along the BGR-SRB border (“exit control” in
order to reduce the secondary movements along the
Western Balkans route), in addition to the
significantly enhanced support at the BGR-TUR
border.
Continuous increased support of TE and HR (via
“rolling Open-Calls) was provided to HUN, BGR and
GRC.
In total, 24 Officers from 6 different TCs have been
deployed as Observers in the framework of JO FOA
2016 BCU.
JO Flexible Operational activities land on Border
Checks was implemented for the first time in 2016,
based on the former Joined Border Check Teams
project.
29 Seconded Guest Officers, with 3 different profiles
were deployed at 22 selected Focal Points for periods
ranging from 2 to 6 months providing operational
support in border checks with a focus on the detection
of false/falsified documents, stolen cars, clandestine
detections and intelligence gathering, thus advancing
the identification of possible risks and threats and
increased situational awareness across the mainly
affected land border areas.
SEA:
In JO FP Sea due to lack of contributions from MS of
experts, the final number of Team Members was quite
low, but even so FX managed to activate 6 FPs and to
coordinate a good level of operational results. 23
first-line officers were deployed for 786 man-days.
The number of incidents is low for 2016 - a total of
236 incidents involving 332 persons. Additionally one
case of drug smuggling was detected. During JO FP
Sea 182 operational days were implemented.
AIR:
JO Focal Points Air 2016 – Regular Officers
In total 106 EU/SAC/TC officers were deployed, for a
total of 3,233 deployment days at the 35 EU/SAC and

host deployment of TC observers
in Focal Points land was
addressed and TC observer were
deployed to some available
Focal Points.
Low level risk of limited
interest/willingness
of
the
MSs/SACs to deploy experts in
TCs (under JO Coordination
Points)
was
substantially
mitigated
by
launching
additional requests via Open Call
for 2016.

Medium level risk of limited
interest/willingness of the MSs
to participate in the PCCC-FP
information
exchange
was
partially mitigated by widening
the scope of information
exchange and promoting the
product in several events.
Medium level risk of limited
interest/willingness of the MS
participate in the different
operations/actions
organized
under EMPACT. Multipurpose
character of the JO was
promoted in several Frontex-LBS
and EUROPOL events.
Under JO FOA BCU - medium to
high level risk of alleged
misconduct related to the
introduction of new legislation
in a host MS was mitigated by:
-COM visits and assessment of
the MS’ legal framework ruling
the border area;

6 Third Country airports which participated in the
implementation of the joint operation.
The deployed officers reported 421 detected
incidents involving 640 persons, 357 refusals, 159
asylum seekers, 8 facilitators and 15 overstayers. In
addition 333 abused documents were also reported as
well as 2 Foreign Terrorist Fighters were identified.

established.

JO Focal Points Air 2016 – Intermediate Managers
59 EU/SAC/TC officers were deployed during the Joint
Operation which provided a platform for information,
experience and best practices exchange at
intermediate managerial level.

EPN
Concept

JOU-2

Joint maritime operations within
the Framework of European Patrols
Network (EPN) will be implemented
according to risk analysis priorities
to support MS at the external
borders in operational areas of
Central Mediterranean, Eastern and
Western Mediterranean Regions,
and Atlantic Ocean in order to
control irregular migration flows
towards the territory of the MS of
the EU and to tackle cross border
crime.
Frontex will maintain enhanced
operational activities in the Central
and Eastern Mediterranean, by joint
operations EPN Triton and EPN
Poseidon Sea, including Hot Spots
concept.
By
demonstrating
sustainable
operational
presence
and
information exchange/gathering in
areas of the external borders
exposed
to
specific
and
disproportionate
pressure,
substantial contribution is provided
in accordance to the EUROSUR
objectives and cooperation and
coordination with other EU Agencies
and
bodies
or
International
Organizations as well as Third
Countries
is
systematically
enhanced.

Under EPN concept
the
following
operational
activities
are
foreseen:
- EPN Triton;
- EPN Poseidon Sea;
- EPN Hera;
- EPN Indalo;
- EPN Minerva

Under the EPN Concept five joint maritime activities
have been implemented as planned. In addition to
that Poseidon Rapid Intervention has been
implemented. All activities resulted in 971
operational days.
Frontex, thanks to increased budget allocations for
joint maritime operations, managed to increase
unprecedented volume of operational activities in all
Frontex history.
Deployed experts performed 155 000 operational
man-days. In addition, during the maritime joint
operations, crewmembers performed 127 000
operational man-days. Finally, approximately 74 000
operational man-days of coordinating staff were
provided by the host countries.
The number of participating EU MS/SAC in joint sea
operations was 30 MS. There were also six Third
Countries involved in sea operations in 2016.
In total, 369 645 migrants were intercepted during the
joint maritime operations. As regards geographical
areas 178 961 migrants were registered in JO Triton
in the Central Mediterranean and 185 944 migrants
arrived to Greece during sea operations in 2016.
During JO’s 3861 debriefing interviews were
performed by Frontex deployed debriefers. Also
Frontex by assuming a new role has significantly
contributed to hotspot concept implementation by
providing experts for fingerprinting and screening.
Technical equipment (seaborne and airborne)
deployed by Frontex delivered 80330 patrolling hours
in JOs.
Frontex has provided substantial contribution to SAR
and combatting cross border crime during maritime
operations in 2016:

2669 search and rescue cases were
registered;

1020
suspected
facilitators
were
apprehended;

80 tons of hashish worth M€ 120, 1.7 tons of
cocaine worth M€ 103 and 13.8 tons of
marihuana worth M€ 20 were seized, mostly
in the Western and Central Mediterranean
Sea;

High level risk of limited
cooperation by non EU countries
(transit and departure) was
partially mitigated by EU –
Turkey statement, which led to
more migrants apprehended by
Turkish authorities as well as
activation
of
readmission
activities.
However, situation in the
Central Mediterranean needs
substantial political change as
operational activities cannot be
seen as standalone solution.
Medium level risk on lack of HR
to implement full scale JOs was
partly mitigated by deployed
experts from MS for FSO
positions as well as launching
equipment for SNE positions.
Medium level risk of not having
proper
TE
(airborne
and
seaborne) for implementation of
annual
JOs
was
partially
mitigated by utilising FASS
service provided by Frontex as
well as using assets from Host
MS. Also all opportunities to
encourage MS to contribute
more with TE were used during
various Frontex meetings.
Medium risk on hesitation of MS
to expand operational concept
of JOs including other coast
guard functions was mitigated
by tailored workshops as well as
by elaboration with EFCA
tailored SOPs which were also
consulted with Host MS.

Concept

JOU-3

The operational activities at
external air borders will be
implemented according to risk
analysis
recommendations
and
identified needs to support MS
across the entire external air
borders as well as in Third Countries
that signed working arrangements
with Frontex. Focus will be given to
threats
and
perceived
vulnerabilities/needs identified at
the external air borders.

The concept will
cover
following
operational
activities:
- JO Alexis I and II
- JO Pegasus
- JO Eurocup

14 million contraband cigarettes worth M€
3.2 were seized;
1020 facilitators apprehended.

JO Alexis 2016 I and II: In total 22 Member States, 6
Third Countries and 32 participating airports took part
in the implementation of Joint Operation Alexis 2016.
To support operational activities Interpol deployed an
IBMTF (Integrated Border Management Task Force)
coordinator at Genève and at Riga (RIX) Airports.
During the joint operation 97 officers (including 12
Third Country observers and 2 Seconded Guest
Officers) were deployed at different airports
according to the operational needs for a total of 2.827
man-days covering the profiles of Second-Line Airport
Officer and/or Advanced-Level Document Officer.
The 30.634 implemented countermeasures of the 2
Alexis activities as well as the high number of
participants and the 2,012 man-days deployed in the
course of the joint operations contributed to the
enhancement of border security.
During this operation, main trends as well as new and
emerging aspects regarding irregular migration flows
were also reported. The information provided by
airports allowed Frontex Risk Analysis Unit to
highlight new and emerging trends.
The Document Road Shows were highly appreciated
and welcomed by the 7 hosting airports, which is also
indicated by high number of border guard officers
trained by the deployed document experts. In the
second phase of JO Alexis a Seminar was also
organized at the Police Academy of Latvia in Riga.
This activity, including the distribution of the
Reference Manual tool has given a significant
contribution to the achievement of the planned
objectives and it represented an opportunity to
engage the local officers with the concept of the joint
operation.

High risk of lack of hosting

operational capabilities at perceived
vulnerabilities/needs.
Effective and efficient operational response
to perceived vulnerabilities meeting existing
threats indications (European Situational
Awareness) in order to enhance security of

Increased response capacity to emergency
situations.

JO Pegasus 2016
A total of 20 Member States with 21 participating
airports took part in the implementation of Joint
Operation Pegasus 2016. During the implementation
16 officers were deployed at these airports according
to operational need for a total of 982 man-days
covering the profiles of Second-Line Interview Officer
and/or Advanced-Level Document Officer.
The 21 participating airports reported 224 validated
incidents involving a total of 316 persons as well as a
total number of 248 unlawfully used travel/supportive
documents and visas.
The added value of Joint Operation Pegasus 2016
consisted of increasing mutual awareness concerning
new modus operandi related to irregular migration as
well as some emerging trends. It also highlighted
some aspects of cross border crime and related
irregular migratory phenomena at the EU’s external
air borders, some of them being already observed in
the framework of other Frontex Joint Operations.
JO Pegasus 2016 delivered the following main
benefits:
 Increased targeted reaction capabilities.
 Better allocation of limited resources

JO Eurocup 2016:
Based on the request of France in total 15 Member
States, 3 Third Countries (Albania, Turkey and
Ukraine) and 7 participating airports took part in Joint
Operation Eurocup 2016. 28 guest officers/third
country observers were deployed at participating
French airports for a total of 575 man-days covering
the profiles of First Line Officer.
There were no incidents identified of a person that
tried to enter France under a false pretext of
attending a Euro 2016 football game whilst actually
intending some other purpose.
Reports relating to irregular migration were received
from the Paris airports of Paris Charles De Gaulle
(CDG), Paris Orly (ORY), and the regional airport of
Bordeaux (BOD).
The reporting mainly related to migrants encountered
in possession of forged counterfeit or otherwise
abused documentation. Some were seeking to enter
or transit via France to other destinations.
There were two incidents of facilitation reported.
There were no incidents of trafficking in human
beings.
There was no evidence that the Eurocup event led to
an increased pressure of irregular migration at the
external air borders of France.
JO Eurocup 2016 delivered the following main
benefits:

Vega
Concept

JOU-4

Frontex will promote effective
protection measures for vulnerable
persons/groups (children and victims
of trafficking in human beings) at
external air, land and sea borders
from a law enforcement point of
view. Under this concept Frontex will
further develop cooperation with
non-EU Countries and with EU
Agencies
and
International
Organisations
(Europol,
FRA,
Interpol,
UNHCR,
and
IOM)
organizing also public awareness
sessions at EU airports.

The Vega concept
will cover following
operational
activities:
- JO VEGA Children
- PP VEGA

Enhanced situational awareness leading to
improved focused recommendations
Flexible and more targeted reaction
capabilities

AIR:
JO Vega Children 2016
In total 19 Member States participated in the Joint
Operation with 15 participating hosting airports and
with 24 officers deployed in mixed teams along with
23 representatives of 6 International and Nongovernmental organizations. During the joint
operation there was one confirmed case of an
unaccompanied minor being detected. There were no
incidents of trafficking in children. However 8
documents were identified as being forged,
counterfeit or obtained unlawfully.
In the frame of this joint operation a documentary
movie was created on the Vega Children activities
which can be used for awareness raising purposes and
promoting effective protection measures for
vulnerable persons/groups (children and victims of
trafficking in human beings) at external air borders.

PP Vega 2016
Vega Countermeasures Handbook Update 2016
In 2016 Frontex supported by experts from Member
States reviewed, updated and restructured the table
of content of the handbook. An update was also
made to the best practices identified by law
enforcement services to prevent, detect and arrest
smugglers/traffickers at airports.
During
workshops
specific
information
on
countermeasures on cases involving vulnerable
persons at airports were added. In addition a
chapter related to countermeasures detection of
Foreign terrorist fighters crossing air borders was
created.

AIR:
High risk of lack of hosting
capabilities
at
participating
airports in ABS JOs due to quickly
shifting national operational
priorities. It was mitigated by
focusing on the most relevant
needs of participating airports
when planning JOs.

High risk of reduced operational
coverage due to growing number
of destinations, airlines and
passengers, and limited number
of resources at participating
airports.
Mitigated
by
continuous
assessment
and
reprioritization of locations for
deployment of SGOs and GOs.
High risk of lack of Third Country
deployments due to their limited
financial possibilities to prefinance deployment costs and
comply with Frontex financial
rules. It was mitigated by close
monitoring of the situation and
enhanced communication by
Third Country partners as well as
by taking over payments with the
support of Travel Desk aiming to
address such issues proactively.
LAND:
Low risk of limited interest of MSs
to provide contribution/feedback
to participate in the drafting of
the product.

87

Finally Frontex and Member States’ experts created
a “light” version of the handbook (international
edition) that will serve as a basis on which third
countries will build upon.

The handbook was presented in
some LBS meetings and also
provided
to
the
Frontex
Consultative Forum.

LAND:
Draft VEGA Handbook on Land Borders was distributed
for testing within the framework of all ongoing Land
Borders Joint Operations.
Based on the experience gained during this testing
phase, the Handbook is to be finalized and foreseen to
be published by Q3 - Q4 2017.

Concept

JOU-5

Frontex will enhance the practical
cooperation on return by scaling up
numbers of joint return operations
where destinations will be based on
request from the EU Member States
on assistance and coordination. The
Rolling Operational Plan will be
replaced by a web based platform
for day to day update of request for
assistance and coordination.
Frontex under this concept will
scale up pre-return assistance to the
EU Member States and facilitate
cooperation with third countries on
identification and acquisition of
travel documents.
The activities will also cover third
country delegation visits (Task
Forces) for identification purpose
and issuing travel documents.
Frontex, as part of the flexible
support, will provide on request

LAND:
Best practices on Land border’s ICC procedures were
implemented in 2016. Workshop with selected EU
experts was organised in FX HQ, with the aim to
explain the scope of the project and to plan a field
visit to the LBS ICCs targeted to learn from the daily
practices/procedures and to put them in a structured
and standardized form.
After the field visit and based on the learnings
acquired during the visits, the experts were requested
to further elaborate a document, illustrating the
identified procedures and tasks – in the format of
guidelines/handbook (for FSO ICC procedures).
On 14.12.2016, a second WS with the same experts
was held in FX HQ, aiming at presenting the final draft
(developed by FX FCO) of the guidelines.
Planned future steps: presentation, during the 1st
HCN Conference in 2017, of the outcomes of the
workshops (the handbook) with the aim to agree on
the harmonized ICC procedures.
SEA:
Frontex Positioning System was tested to verify its full
operational capability for Frontex coordinated
operational activities under real conditions. More
than 15 assets from different MS had the FPS
transceivers installed by Frontex on board during
Indalo, Poseidon and Triton 2016 joint maritime
operations, increasing the situational awareness and
reaction capability of command and control
structures.
Collection and aggregation of financial data was
improved by working on the new prototype of the
transceivers and on the functionalities of the software

LAND:
No risks identified
SEA:
High risk of lack of availability of
SBS
staff
to
implement
additional activities in parallel
with JOs was partially mitigated
by involving also MS various
profile experts as well as
operational platforms used to
integrate the SBS services.
Medium level risk of dependency
on external contractor to deliver
agreed product for FPS was
mitigated by constant follow up
and reminders, however still
implementation was delayed.
Medium level risk on willingness
of MS to accept the services was
mitigated
by
using
the
opportunity of various tailored
meetings and workshops to
advertise and explain the
usefulness of the services,
allowing Frontex to continue
testing and developing products
in a real operational scenario.
Low level risk of interagency
cooperation as regards coast
guard issues among agencies was
mitigated by establishing the
Steering group and nominating
Frontex contact person, who

MS crews and Staff of the ICC Rome where a console
with the software was deployed was collected and
used for further development.
Within FCOI the focus in 2016 was in (still on-going)
preparations for Aerostatic Aerial Border Surveillance
Demo “Tethered Balloons”.
46 EU MS/SAC officers (369 man-days), participated in
EPN Staff Exchange programme under which working
visits were performed in migrant reception sites of
Spain and hotspots in Italy and Greece in connection
with main joint maritime operations. Additionally,
tailored exchanges were organised and Common
Patrols with Liaison Officers on-board neighbouring
countries were performed between ITA and GRC
(September) and BGR and ROM (1 August-8 October),
the latter with weekly communication with Frontex
HQ and contribution to coast guard functions.
EPN Yellow Pages web based database was promoted
during several meetings as the primary source of
practical
information
before
operational
deployments. Successful introduction of a new
section on Hotspots was implemented in 2016.
Detailed information on nine Hotspots was added.
Frontex organized several meetings under EPN
General umbrella: one in May (with c. 110
participants), one in December (with c. 50
participants) and special event launching European
Coast Guard Cooperation Network which took over the
legacy of the EPN in November (with c. 200
participants). Additionally, there were 3 Tailored
Working Group meetings organized during 2016 with
representatives of 18 MS and one international
organization (MAOC), resulting in a finalised draft of
the handbook - best practices in boarding and
interception. Frontex also contributed to regional
maritime cooperation by providing support for the
Latvian presidency of Baltic Sea Region Border Control
Cooperation. Frontex was also an active player in

Medium level risk of overlapping
and
cost-effectiveness
of
products and services within the
Agency was balanced by inviting
representatives
from
other
respective units and divisions to
SBS organized meetings and
workshops as well as sharing
materials related to the topic.
AIR:
Low risk of lack of participation
in OHAC and All-in-one meeting
from MS with the lack of
strategic airports of MS due to
not being able to participate in
the event. It was mitigated by
close
monitoring
and
contingency
planning
for
rescheduling
the
implementation dates if needed.
Low risk of lack of capacity to
organize the meeting or find a
suitable location for the OHAC
conference where around 150
persons were expected to
participate was mitigated by
contingency

required number of experts.
Medium risk of inability of
INTERPOL and Frontex to

due
to
legal/
political/administrative
constrains was mitigated by
investigating the constrains and
propose
legal/
administrative/political change.

The aim of the Conference is to facilitate personal
contacts between the operational leaders of
international airports. Furthermore, it is a good
opportunity for delegates to discuss issues of shared
interest and be updated on the latest developments
in the field of air border integrated management.
The conference was attended by 132 officials,
Commanders of Border Guard Services at airports and
Organisations' Representatives. The three days
conference went smoothly with declared satisfaction
of several delegations. Non relevant issues were
identified and the participants showed satisfaction
for attending the event. Frontex staff presented the
activities planned for 2016, answering to the
questions and clarifications requested by the
participants. Several delegation praised the
usefulness of the conference. First Risk Analysis Unit,
but also other speakers reported on the challenges
faced today by airport border guards. Comprehensive
information on Fundamental Rights, children, PNR
and API were provided with specific emphases on
travel documents (e.g. Frontex Reference Manual Interpol Dial Doc project). Apart the presentation

91

given by the Turkish representatives, Frontex
speakers underlined several times the importance of
TC cooperation for air border activities. Sustained
also during informal meetings and discussions by the
presence of a member of the Frontex IEC Unit staff,
the Frontex team strengthened the relationship with
the TC heads of airports present at the Malaga event.
All-in-One meeting;
Every year Frontex ABS organises the All-In-One
meeting as a consulting session for all operational
activities to be carried out at airports. In this meeting
all European Union Member States’ representatives
received details about the achievements of Frontex
Air Border activities in 2015 and foreseen projects in
2016. The annual meeting was a significant platform
of the cooperation between Frontex and Member
States where the Member States representatives had
the possibility to express their opinions and
observations on the practical issues of Air Border
Sector programme of work and model together with
Frontex officials the way the operational activities
and pilot projects will be implemented by the Agency
over the course of the upcoming year.
Apart from the necessity to discuss and develop
practical aspects of the projects, the importance of
the meeting lied also in the building up of mutual
partnership, trust, understanding of the needs and
possibilities of both sides, Frontex and competent
Member States’ authorities, which was necessary for
the successful implementation of the activities.
During this meeting ideas for future long-term
perspective development were also exchanged, from
which Frontex Air Border Sector and Member States
could benefit when the programme of work for the
coming year was prepared.
PP Reference Manual;

The last version of the Reference Manual library
(RM2016), was issued in December 2016. This version
contains 7014 files, 10% more than the last version
issued at the end of the previous year. The libraries
content counts for 507 folders, 3259 PDF files and
1315 HTML files. In total the RM tool has been grown
to the size of 5.74 GB, 8% more than the last version
delivered at the end of 2015. In course of 2016 the
FRONTEX Reference Manual team decided to produce
mostly Frontex Quick Check Cards22 (QCCs) as a
priority, and throughout the year about 300 new QCCs
were produced. In 2016 Reference Manual has been
distributed by the Frontex Reference Manual Team as
well as by ABS SGO’s and GO’s during Frontex
coordinated Join Operations (JOs). It was also
distributed to NFPOCs and to Airport representatives
in a total of 500 copies throughout the year. Based on
the information received by the activity manager
during different activities of Frontex at the air
borders domain, some of the EU Airports, such as
Frankfurt, Paris-CDG, Sofia, Warsaw, Lisbon,
Budapest, Prague and Bratislava are using the tool on
the national Border Police intranet. The last releases
of the library were also delivered to Sea Border and
Land Border Sector operations. Upon the request of
Training Unit, the latest copies of the library were
also delivered for supporting training activities,
mainly “Road shows”.

The Frontex Quick Check Card (QCC) is a decision-aid, seeking to support travel document authenticity verification at first encounter. The product acts as a single point of
reference for the first line officer. It contains the most relevant information on the security features and vulnerabilities of the inspected document (based on its specimen) as
well as the best detection points (identified through an analysis of all available alerts and risks known concerning the same document). These detection points can be optical
or physical security features (and the combination of both) depending on the specification of the concerned identity document (MRTD, e-MRTD, ID cards, supporting documents,
etc.) and the reported threats the document is exposed to.

On 10 August the Deputy Executive Director of
Frontex was nominated as Steering Committee
Member (and the Director of Operations Division as
alternate member) on behalf of Frontex. INTERPOL
nominated Tim Morris – Executive Director Police
Services and as alternate member Michael O’Connell
– Director of Operational Support and Analysis to the
Steering Committee.
The Frontex Project Board was established and its
first meeting took place on 18 August 2016. The
Project Board was also established at INTERPOL.
Upon the approved PID the Phase 1 of the project was
planned and the activities of Phase 1 were approved
on 29 November 2016 during the first INTERPOLFRONTEX interagency Steering Committee meeting.
An Implementing Arrangement concerning Frontex’
direct access to and use of the INTERPOL Information
System was signed by DED and the Secretary General
of INTERPOL. The Arrangement entered into force on
21 December 2016.

The operational flexibility allocated
to joint maritime operations might
be used to enhance ongoing
operational activities such as EPN
Triton, EPN Poseidon Sea, and EPN
Indalo.
Operational Flexibility at external
air borders concerns the fluctuating
migratory pressure that varies from
week to week. Such phenomena are
identified often at the last moment
before activities are launched or
even during them. The reserved
operational flexibility budget has
therefore been distributed to the
different joint operations carried
out at airports with the aim to have
resources immediately available per
each of those activities while
additional budget can be later
transferred
between
different
activities according to the need.
The use of the budget will be
triggered by emerging needs
identified by Frontex or directly by
the participating Member States in
course of the year. The needs may
encompass a certain number of
irregular migrants arriving at
certain airports, new connections
etc.

FRAN: 4 meetings of Frontex Risk Analysis Network
(April, June, September, December) with average
participation of 29 Member States/Schengen
Associated Countries, and Commission, EASO and
Europol. Monitoring of the quality and timeliness of
information upload. Resolving technical problems and
responding to queries. All FRAN meetings
implemented as planned providing a forum for
discussion on irregular migratory trends and updates
on RAU activities. 4 FRAN Quarterly reports issued in
full and public versions. Risk Analysis for 2016 issued
in full and public versions. Presentation packages at
various WPs and other fora. Member States regularly
updated on the developments and state of play of the
FRAN and the EDF-RAN information exchanges.
Knowledge on concrete reporting issues in Member
States, and agreement on the way to solve them in
the future. FRAN Annual Survey conducted in MayJune. Presentation of the Annual FRAN report findings
in the June meeting, and full report distributed in
September.
Guest Analyst workshop with representatives of 6

Quarterly reports and monthly analytical outputs, as
relevant. Increased quality of and enhanced

network as the basis for better quality Frontex

The following risks
were
identified in the beginning of
2016
1) Massive arrivals stretch MS
resources
The pressure started to decrease
especially during Q2 2016. The
quality review of the data
collected in 2016 will be
finalised in the FRAN Annual
Report by the end Q2 2017.
Some of the flow data especially
in relation to intra-Schengen
movements continued to be
shared
on
bilateral
or
multilateral (but not on an EUwide) basis among Member
States
without
Frontex
involvement.
2) New focus on intra-EU and
intra-Schengen
movements

13.1

FX has collected data on intraSchengen
movements
on
monthly basis since 2014.
However some MS continued to
challenge this and refrain from
reporting for political reasons.
Also some MS have technical
difficulties. Frontex developed
the reporting template further
in 2016 to facilitate the work
done by MS. The new regulation
clarified
and
strengthened
Frontex role regarding data
collection and analysis of intraSchengen flow data.
3) Focus on document fraud
The scope and the outputs of FX
document fraud related work
continues to be limited due to
limited HR. However, the

Impostor Risk Profiles.
THB Expert Group: did not took place due to the
unavailability of human resources. In addition, the
Handbook on Risk Profiles on Trafficking in Human
Beings 2015 (Limited), was not updated due to
unavailability of human resources.
In line with the developments of the draft EBCG
regulation and following its adoption, RAU has been
tasked with the launch of developing this new work
area. As result, the following unplanned outputs were
delivered:
Early engagement with Member States on the
development of the Vulnerability Assessment concept
and process, in the framework of four Vulnerability
Assessment meetings (May, July, August, November)
with average participation of 28 Member
States/Schengen
Associated
Countries
and
Commission. Additionally, one meeting related to
Vulnerability Assessment testing (September).
Further the first meeting of Vulnerability Assessment
Network (December).
Setting up of the conceptual framework of the
Common Vulnerability Assessment Methodology
(objective criteria and objective indicators) adopted
by the Management Board in November. Annual
Implementation Plan 2017 presented to the
Management
Board.
Establishment
of
the
Vulnerability Assessment network and organisation of
its first meeting in December 2016. Development of
Terms of Reference and working procedures (Q4).
Resolving technical problems and responding to
queries.

Handbook on Impostors and the
joint work kicked off on Syrian
fraudulent documents were
sufficient to keep most Member
States satisfied with the EDF
activities, though also the
envisaged monthly statistical
overview/access to interactive
data dashboards had to be
postponed to an undefined
future due to other priorities.
4) Earlier annual figures and
the ARA
This risk materialised to the
limited extent in the beginning
of 2016 when there was a
confusion in the public between
the number of IBC detections
and the number of irregular
migrants that arrived to the EU
in 2015.
5) Disruptions in THB related
analytical work
There were delays in the
recruitment of the dedicated
FTE, thus the resource was not
available in 2016. Therefore, the
Handbook on THB victim profiles
was not updated in 2016.
In addition, the following risk
emerged in the course of 2016
The preparation and adoption of
the
EBCG regulation
and
assignment of one of the new
priority areas of the regulation
to RAU has meant intensified
workload for the staff of the
unit, to take over important
objectives
and
tasks
not
included in the programming
document. No dedicated staff
could be recruited for these new
prioritized tasks until December

97

2016, and all preparatory work
was carried out by existing
resources.
Reallocation
of
existing staff to this new task
has
impacted
on
the
deliverables and timeliness of
regular outputs especially in the
second semester 2016.
The high political pressure for
immediate results concerning
Vulnerability Assessment pushed
forward the start of the work on
the VA concept, methodology,
and work plan much in advance
of the formal adoption of EBCG
regulation. This enabled the
adoption of the Common
Vulnerability
Assessment
methodology in proximity to the
adoption
of
the
EBCG
Regulation,
however
has
increased the risks associated to
insufficient consolidation of the
work performed.

implementation and in the evaluation of each joint
operation and Rapid Intervention.

Availability of skilled experts
for debriefing activities in JOs

22

The lack of skilled debriefing
experts in JO remained a
problem throughout 2016. This
included also withdrawal of
SGOS after selection, to be
deployed as debriefing advisors
in JOs. As a consequence: in
increasing number of debriefing
teams, reliance on guest officers
who did not have the required
skills, and following increasing
workload
on
operational
analysts,
mentoring,
and

In particular, during the preparatory phase they
provided the analytical assessments that served as a
foundation for the planning and later for the drafting
of the operational plan in relation to the
identification of the operational concept, the
definition of the operational area, the duration and
period of the JO, and providing knowledge basis for
the deployment of assets and experts. In addition,
they provided their input in the definition of the
resources, structure and processes that relate to
intelligence, and supported the negotiation with the
Member States.
During the implementation of the joint operations and
the rapid intervention the operational analysts
provided regular analytical reports, with three
distinct set of addressees, the bi-weekly analytical
reports for the project team and the coordination
structure of the operation such as the ICC, the biweekly analytical briefing for Frontex management
and internal stakeholders and the bi-weekly
analytical updates for the experts seconded in the
operational areas. In the source of the year a twopage dedicated product was developed to be shared
with other actors in the operational area: Weekly
Analytical Overview. In addition, several ad-hoc
reports were drafted on specific themes, whenever
this was considered appropriate.
Operational analysts and FLO Intelligence Component
staff participated in operational meetings on
planning, kick off, briefings/trainings and evaluation
of JOs conducted in the region covered.
During 2016 RAU issued analytical reports for the
planning and evaluation of joint operations as well as
regular periodical analytical reports addressed to
various stakeholder groups (Operational Analytical
Brief, Operational Analytical report, Operational
Analytical Update) during the implementation of
operations and ad hoc reports as relevant (Analytical
Warning for Operations, JO Briefing Notes). In the
course of 2016 a new type of regular periodical report
was launched Weekly Analytical Overview meeting
the needs of all actors in the operational area,

controlling the debriefing team,
less accurate information for
risk analysis. .
Proper
management
of
debriefing activities related to
lack of debriefing advisor
This risk materialised in the
beginning of 2016 while the staff
recruited to perform this
function joined later in 2016.
AB-RAN Meetings
Some MS/SAC (approx. one
third)
changed
their
representatives to AB-RAN. This
creates problems in smooth flow
of meetings and network
activity.
Once the Pulsar Data collection
is transferred to JORA, access
rights to MS/SAC will be
provided only to one or
exceptionally two designated
national representatives per
MS/SAC who need to be
permanent members of the ABRAN.
Hosting
authorities
sensitivities
hampering
intelligence collection and risk
analysis
Often hosting authorities during
JOs hamper the possibility to
access
information.
This
happens for issues that are
considered sensitive or for the
lack of understanding of the
work carried out at Frontex. In
case the operational analyst
insists in having access or

99

including e.g. EURTF, EUNAVFORMED, NATO. In
addition, regular tailored periodical analytical
reporting from key operational areas was provided to
IPCR and ISAA.
JORA templates were elaborated for the purpose of
operational reporting.
Responses based on analytical findings were provided
to numerous stakeholders upon request. Advice and
update on the impact of geopolitical developments in
key transit countries, on the operational response was
provided as needed/requested.
Situation awareness at the external air borders
provided as input to regular and ad hoc operational
analysis, and for information of Frontex Management
in Weekly Operational Briefings.
ABT support
The Assessment for Operational Deployment was
prepared in September to facilitate the preparation
of ABT. Executive summary was included for the
elaboration of Programming Document 2017.
Debriefing activities:
In 2016 in the framework of the analytical input to
joint operations approx. 4 525 debriefing interview
reports were submitted to Frontex; 3 926 in sea
operations and 599 in land operations. Besides that
674 intelligence officer reports and 680 landing
reports were made and sent to Frontex Risk Analysis
Unit to be processed.3 RAU Debriefing Advisors (SNE)
were providing regional support to the Human
Intelligence Network (HUMINT). In order to enhance
regional coordination, one of them was deployed in
Greece one in Italy and another one was tasked to
support debriefing activities in Spain, Bulgaria,
Hungary and Italy and Greece based on intelligence
needs. In total they were deployed during 28 missions
to many operational areas (Indalo, Triton, Minerva,
Poseidon Sea, Land, as well as Flexible Activities)
where they delivered more than 100 Debriefing
Activity Workshops involving about 400 MS experts
and national officers coming from different MS.
Regular contacts and direction for debriefers was
provided through briefing meetings with operational
analysts and weekly video conferences.

removing the factors that
hamper
access
to
the
intelligence
required,
the
hosting authorities react by
reducing
the
level
of
cooperation or trying to limit
intelligence activities in the
operational area.
Reduction
of
analytical
capabilities due to manning of
the EURTF in Italy and Greece
The EURTF concept requires the
presence in Catania and Piraeus
of
a
RAU
member
for
intelligence issues. Due to lack
of
dedicated
staff
and
recruitment
delays,
the
presence of operational analyst
in EURTF was reduced, and
operational analyst work at HQ
was prioritised.
Ad hoc tasking
Operational analysts overcome
by unplanned tasks with short
deadlines that impinge on the
capacity to exploit to the full
extent information gathered.
No automation of risk analysis
and data visualisation
Lack of knowledge management
systems that can automatize
analysis and visualisation of data
and analytical findings. High
reliance on manual processing.
With growing amount of data,
the analytical outputs become
less
accurate
and
time
consuming to produce.

In addition an External Debriefing Expert was
contracted by RAU (during the period June to
December 2016) and had 8 missions to several
operational areas (Triton/ Italy, Poseidon Sea/
Greece, Flexible Activities JO/ Hungary) and 2 in the
Frontex Headquarters. The External Debriefing Expert
delivered 12 two-day workshops, with approximately
35 to 40 participants in each workshop from several
MS experts (screening and debriefing experts,
fingerprint officers, document experts, FSO, team
leaders) cultural mediators and other Frontex staff.
In order to provide ongoing support to the debriefing
activities in the hotspots, Operational Analysts on
rotation undertook missions to the EURTF in
Italy. The Debriefing Advisors were also deployed to
the EURTF Office in Catania as a part of RAU team
responsible for operational intelligence gathering.
Two HUMINT network meetings organised by RAU took
place at FX HQ comprising of Intelligence Officers,
Team Leaders of Joint Debriefing Teams involved in
the hotspots in Joint Operations Triton, Indalo and
Poseidon 2016. These meetings focused on the

RAU staff took care of the selection of Seconded
Guest officers for the debriefers profile, monitoring
their performance and providing briefing/information
to support their activities during deployment. The
support that was provided by RAU staff included
having regular video conferences and field mentoring
and resulted in improved quality of reporting from
SGOs.
RAU staff supported TRU Intelligence Professionals
training events by sending an analyst for the planning
of training activities, the evaluation of the trainees
and providing presentation on the latest issues
related to debriefing deployments in joint operations.

Due to the continued limited geographical and time
limited operations at air borders, RAU maintained
situational awareness across the greater part of the
external air borders with weekly reporting from over
100 key EU and Schengen airports using the Pulsar
Weekly statistical data collection. Reports based on
the data were prepared by RAU and shared with MS
and SAC. The reporting process was further
strengthened by the use of analysts from 27 MS/SAC
attending the two meetings of the Air Borders Risk
Analysis Network (AB-RAN) carried out during the
course of the year, which allowed for the
identification and sharing of emerging trends across
the sector.

some were due to Frontex
limited
human
resources
capacity due to unforeseen
workload and other priorities. .
Shifting or new priorities of the
unit and lack of adequate staff
Analytical and all-sources based
third country monitoring had to
be given a lower priority due to
high number of ad hoc tasks.
Neither the already over-due
update of the methodology nor
the review of the planned
product portfolio did not take
place.
Linguistic barriers preventing
us from engaging with relevant
experts from regional RANs
This risk was mitigated to the
extent
possible
through
interpretation (AFIC, EaP, and
TU-RAN) during the meetings of
the impacted regional risk
analysis networks. Also an
increasing number of products
were translated in different EU
and non-EU languages to
facilitate the joint work and
sharing of the generated
knowledge in third countries.
Poor or limited access to
relevant information sources in
third countries
RAU is increasingly invited to
join different EU missions, thus
providing more opportunities for
direct access to data.

The risks that were identified in
the beginning of 2016, and their
real assessment are as follows:
Lack of consistency of Eurosur

This risk has materialised in 2016
and is being addressed with the
update of the EUROSUR Data
Model (limited to the illegal

Lack of analytical contributions
from MS will lead to an
incomplete situational picture
This risk has materialised in 2016
and will be partially addressed
with the implementation of the
EUROSUR Analysis Tools which
will permit the MSs to not only
used their data but also to
manage and query their reports
within EUROSUR.
In addition the following risk
occurred:
Following the signature of
Copernicus DA at the end of 2015
and
Copernicus
budget
availability for earth observation
services, 2016 Frontex budget
allocated for these services
under RAU-4 (3120) was at risk
of non-implementation. This
was addressed through reallocation of the budget to other
GIS Eurosur-related services
increasing the utilisation of
earth observation services for
risk analysis.
Data and GIS services:
The risk anticipated in the
beginning of 2016 was linked to
the availability of HR to respond
to increased demands for data
and GIS support. The risk has
materialised but prioritization
efforts have allowed to continue
our data and GIS support
activities.

Processing of personal data for risk analysis (
PeDRA)
PeDRA Pilot Exercise successfully launched and
implemented in a succession of Joint Operations in
Italy, Spain and Greece, from 2 February 2016 until
31 January 2017. Personal data immediately began to
arrive in Frontex, were processed, used for risk
analysis and then were transmitted to Europol. During
the Pilot Exercise a total of 2 800 interviews were
performed and successfully reported from 5 Joint
Operations resulting in a vastly improved
understanding of criminal networks involved in human
smuggling. The output of the first year of
implementation of PeDRA is an analytical database
containing information collected during nearly 3 000
interviews with migrants newly arrived to the EU. The
data are summarised in SAS Visual Analytics for use in
risk analysis processes, and also for business
intelligence functions. The second output is a total of
677 cases containing personal data with contextual
information were transmitted from RAU to Europol on
the SIENA network. These cases contained a total of
1 858 person descriptions, and 273 person identities
along with 1 093 telephone numbers and 445
addresses. All data arriving at Europol were

all risks identified in the
beginning
of
2016,
were
successfully mitigated in the
course of the year by clear
communication
with
stakeholders
and
effective
promotion of the benefits of all
PeDRA activities.

systematically checked for matches with data already
in their system; during the Pilot Exercise data
transmitted by Frontex resulted in 47 hits with the
Europol databases, highlighting potential new areas
for investigation.
Alongside the ongoing operational activities, a new
unplanned activities were undertaken following the
adoption of the new EBCG regulation: Frontex
successfully applied to the EDPS for prior
authorisation to implement three new activities based
on Art 47 of 2016/1624.
Access to sources:
Access to main open source intelligence sources was
continued throughout 2017. New data source was

The coordination of Frontex contribution to EU
Policy Cycle/EMPACT related activities was provided
by Product and Change Manager to Director of
Operations Division and Anti-Trafficking Coordinator,
while RAU, apart from is share within led and
participated Operational Actions, provided the
availability of Mission budget.
 Frontex increased its share within EU Policy
Cycle/EMPACT both with the range of the Priorities
and the number of Operational Actions. In 2016, the
Agency led/co-led 11 and participated in 16
Operational Actions in 3 EMPACT Priorities already,
namely Facilitation of Illegal Immigration, THB and
Illicit Firearms Trafficking. The most significant share
concerned Facilitation of Illegal Immigration with 8
Actions led/co-led and 8 more participated and the
role of the Co-Driver of the whole Priority.
 In 2016, the Agency has stepped into the new field
such as Excise goods smuggling, following the
extension of its mandate and development of the
multi-purpose concept of the Joint Operation.
Although the Operational Actions start in 2017, the
prep meetings and OAP 2017 drafting was held in
2016. Frontex main focus within this Priority is
tobacco products and alcohol smuggling via the EU
external borders in land and maritime domain.

108

 Frontex has strived to play more intensive
cooperation with customs within EMPACT activities.
This has been encouraged by COSI and fulfilled also
via the Coordination Mechanism. Some Operational
Actions participated by Frontex within Firearms
EMPACT Priorities are supported by national customs
authorities. In 2016, the Agency has started to
prepare its support to JCOs under 8th Action Plan of
CCWP, attended CCWP expert group meetings
regularly; aligned its engagement with Excise Goods
EMPACT Priority. This required the sequence of
meetings and missions that have been executed.
 Within EMPACT, Frontex concentrated its efforts
along with MSs, Europol and Interpol on intelligence
gathering, risk analysis, identification of links to
other
criminal
areas
including
terrorism,
synchronization
and
synergy
with
Frontex
coordinated, multipurpose JOs, availing Eurosur
Fusion Services for cross-border crime and facilitated
illegal immigration tackling, sharing the debriefing
results to feed the investigations and operational
work and the enhancement of the cooperation with
certain MS, WB countries and the Eastern European
region.
 Frontex was actively involved in the preparation and
fulfilment of Joint Action Days under EU Policy Cycle
led either by MS or Europol under 2016 line (Ciconia
Alba Operation). JADs aimed at the intensified
controls, searches that could end with apprehensions
of irregular migrants, detections of false docs and ID
fraud, seizures of illegal goods, arrest of criminals
(facilitators, smugglers). They focused on certain
phenomenon, region, route, modus operandi,
criminal network. They also aimed at initiating new
investigations with intelligence obtained or end the
on-going investigations with arrests and seizures.
Frontex was involved in the Large-Scale JAD under
Ciconia Alba managed by Europol aiming at tackling
facilitated illegal immigration, ID fraud, THB, drug
trafficking and payment card fraud in air border
domain. Frontex officers were deployed in the
operational coordination centre at Europol to
facilitate the exchange of information. Moreover, the

109









Agency was involved in JADs organized by MS or
Europol such as GAAD, Vulcan, Elster and took the
coordination role within the EMPACT Activity/former
JAD DANUBE with the co-leadership of Hungary that
allowed to test the closer cooperation between
central and regional border police units and
investigative units with the assistance of other MS and
both Europol and Interpol. Information gathered or
analysed during operation DANUBE allowed to boost
or start new intelligence cases/investigations against
migrant smuggling facilitators. The action held in
September 2016, resulted also in the seizures of
illegal goods smuggling, detection of stolen vehicles
and false documents. Similar activity was executed
by the Agency in the air border domain, within the
framework of the action BELLEROPHON targeting the
risk analysis based airports and air routes exploited
by the facilitators of illegal immigration.
Under EMPACT Priorities, Frontex availed its Eurosur
related services (including the analysis related
services) to the national criminal police, border
guard, customs authorities and Europol (both within
FII and Firearms domain) to support their effort with
preventing and combating cross-border crime, then
fulfilling one of the objectives set in Eurosur
Regulation.
In the field of the fight against firearms trafficking,
beside the involvement in EMPACT Firearms Priority,
Frontex became the participant in European Firearms
Expert Group closely linked to Firearms EMPACT
priority, bringing its perspective of EU external
border protection, but also to further build The
Agency capacity in the firearms trafficking related
field in full alignment of EFE efforts in order to
counteract this phenomena better jointly.
In November 2016, the Agency joined at the invitation
by COM the First meeting of European Union Firearms
Experts (EFE) and South East Europe Countries
Experts (SEEFEG) aiming at more efficient firearms
trafficking counteraction from WB to EU and linked to
the Actions under Firearms EMPACT Priority.
The overall coordination of EMPACT has been fulfilled
on DOPD’s Office level in 2016. This has required both

110

the internal and external undertakings, involving
almost all units and sectors of OPD, with a significant
burden on RAU. Several analytical materials,
presentations were elaborated, shared and presented
within EMPACT. Series of preparatory meetings at
Frontex, kick-off / debriefing / evaluation /
coordination meetings and JADs fulfilment were
executed within 2016 mostly by means of missions.
This has also included the deployments at the
Coordination Centres established for JADs.

-JRC suffered organizational changes
and it was decided that a new JRC unit
will take over the task.
-RDU visited JRC to push the things
forward. JRC mentioned that it has to
contact DG Home and confirm that this
activity is also a priority for DG
Home/border guard community and get
approval/support and perhaps budget.
-This year JRC informed Frontex that all
the approvals are obtained and was
supposed to visit Frontex in March for
further clarifications. The visit was
cancelled by JRC and a videoconference
was proposed instead. JRC has yet to
reply.

To provide the risk analysis layer
of the CPIP/ESP, as required by
the EUROSUR regulation.

Regular updates of impact levels
for relevant sea and land border
sections as per agreed procedure
RAU Business User inputs provided
as required

Impact levels for Eurosur border
sections were regularly reassessed and
five
updates
were
performed
throughout the year.
In 2016 RAU uploaded 375 reports in the
Analysis
Layer,
including
Key
Developments (36), Briefing Notes (2),
Analytical Monitors (18) and Earth
Observation Reports (319).

The risks that were identified in
the beginning of 2016, and their
real assessment are as follows:
Lack of consistency of Eurosur
data
This risk has materialised in 2016
and is being addressed with the
update of the EUROSUR Data
Model (limited to the illegal
migration incident types) taking
place in 2017.
Lack of analytical contributions
from MS will lead to an
incomplete situational picture
This risk has materialised in 2016
and will be partially addressed
with the implementation of the
EUROSUR Analysis Tools which
will permit the MSs to not only
used their data but also to
manage and query their reports
within EUROSUR.

Extensive cooperation with EU SatCen
for the provision of imagery analysis
services
(Pre-frontier
Monitoring,
Coastal Monitoring, Reference Mapping
and Evolution) within the framework of
the Copernicus Delegation Agreement.
As a result, Member States had the
possibility to request Earth Observation
services and access 319 Imagery
Intelligence and Geospatial Intelligence
reports shared in the CPIP/ESP Analysis
Layer. In order to increase the
understanding and utilization of Earth
Observation services and products, RAU
organized two training sessions led by
EU SatCen experts and attended by
participants from 9 Member States.
Regular senior user input and validation
of outputs to ICT within the EUROSUR
Analysis Tools project.
Requirements collection for the Third
Country Monitoring (TCM) application,
aiming at improving the general
functionalities of the application but
most importantly automatizing the
population of the EUROSUR Analysis
Layer.

In addition the following risk
occurred:
Following the signature of
Copernicus DA at the end of 2015
and
Copernicus
budget
availability for earth observation
services, 2016 Frontex budget
allocated for these services
under RAU-4 (3120) was at risk
of non-implementation. This
was addressed through reallocation of the budget to other
GIS Eurosur-related services
increasing the utilisation of
earth observation services for
risk analysis.

FRO contributed to the drafting of operational plans by
providing inputs designed to promote the respect of
fundamental rights (FR) in all Agency’s operational
activities. With the entry into force of the European
Border and Coast Guard (EBCG) Regulation 2016/1624
on 6 October 2016, FRO supported the Agency’s work
and contributed to the alignment of operational plan
with the EBCG Regulation by revising the guidelines for
various profiles in the plans, designing a Questionnaire
on referral mechanism for vulnerable groups in Member
States where operations take place, supported the
drafting on an SOP on complaint mechanism and
submitted the Complaint form for potential violations
of fundamental rights. Furthermore, FRO has drafted a
FR specific operational objective and basic compliance
indicators aiming at gathering of quantitative and
qualitative measurement necessary for providing FRO
observations to the Frontex Evaluation Reports (Article
26 EBCG Regulation). FRO together with Air Border
Sector further developed a Work Package in the
implementation of the new regulation aiming at
providing sufficient information on the protection of
vulnerable groups especially children. FRO has also
extensively contributed to the Guide for JROs
coordinated by Frontex, which includes a list of
forbidden restraints and a model fit-to-travel form that
could serve to harmonise EU practices and procedures.
FRO team has also extensively supported the training
activities of specific profiles within the EBCG teams,
such as EUROSUR operations, Maritime Border
Surveillance Officers, force return monitors, FR for
forced return escorts, FR for border guards on line tool
development, and FR and international protection in

The mechanisms of SIR reporting was established as a
part of an effective monitoring mechanism. In 2016, 24
serious incidents were reported and followed-up by
FRO. As a result, FRO closed ten incidents and provided
recommendations and corrective measures while other
serious incidents are pending as the investigation is still
ongoing by respective MSs authorities. The allegations
refer to potential violations of the right to human
dignity and integrity, right to asylum and protection in
the event of removal, expulsion or extradition, right to
property, rights of the child, right to liberty and
security, right to good administration and prohibition of
discrimination. FRO contributed to the ongoing process
of revision of the existing SOP on Serious incident
reporting.
FRO continuously work on improvement of an effective
monitoring mechanism as provided by the Regulation.
FRO team visited sea, land and return operations and
provided substantive recommendations for prevention
of FR violations in the operational activities. This
includes the setting up of a complaint mechanism as a
new feature for a tool to monitor compliance with FR
in all Agency’s activities. For the purpose of an efficient
monitoring by FRO and responding by MSs, FRO also
engaged in the creation of an electronic case
management system, drafted and consulted the
complaint form, supported the drafting of the rules of
the mechanism, and activated the establishment of
competent focal points within national authorities and
human rights institutions in charge of monitoring and
investigating violations of fundamental rights by border
authorities in their Member States.
FRO provided specific reports on fundamental rights
implications on various fundamental rights matters of
interest for the activities of the Agency, such as return
and readmission, the protection of children in the
operational and capacity building activities. Ad Hoc
reports on specific situations were also compiled.

In 2016, FRO compiled the Fundamental Rights Progress

March. FRO also contributed to the Evaluation of
‘Frontex Design for Evaluations of Joint Operations and
Pilot Projects’ covering the period from 2012-2016. As
a
result,
the
external
evaluator
provided
recommendations for the Agency on how to improve
evaluation reporting in a manner to enable FRO to
provide observations to the Frontex Evaluation reports
as well as indicated lack of staff to support FRO in
carrying out her mandate. FRO also contributing to the
drafting of Programming document 2018-2020 by
setting
multi-annual
objectives
and
related
performance and compliance indicators.
FRO coordinated the drafting of the profile of the
forced return monitors profile and extensively
supported the creation of the pool of monitors (Art 29
ECBG).
FRO designed the concept for a town hall meeting on
the EASO-Frontex tool on access to Asylum Procedure in
June.
FRO also provided an entirely new content for the FR
aspects of the updated EBCGA webpage, and also the
content of the web referring to the complaints
mechanism in order to ensure clear and accessible
information to potential complainants.
FRO regularly briefs both officers to be deployed to
operational activities and new staff joining the Agency
on FR obligations and tools for ensuring
implementation.
In March FRO presented a final draft of the FR Strategy
after intensive internal units and external consultation
with relevant stakeholders, such as Consultative Forum
and Management Board. The negotiation of the EBCG

Draft annual accounts and financial reports

According to Art 98 (1) Frontex Financial Regulation (FFR) the accounting officer of the Agency shall send the
provisional accounts to the accounting officer of the Commission and to the Court of Auditors by 1 March of the
following year.
By 1 June of the following year at the latest, the Court of Auditors shall make its observations on the provisional
account of the Agency (Art 99(1) FFR). On receiving the Court of Auditors observations on the provisional accounts
of the Agency, the accounting officer shall draw up the final accounts of the Agency. The Executive Director shall
send them to the Management Board, which shall give an opinion on these accounts (Art 99(2) FFR).
The accounting officer shall send the final accounts, together with the opinion of the Management Board to the
accounting officer of the Commission, the Court of Auditors, the European Parliament and the Council by 1 July of
the following financial year.
The provisional accounts and a reporting package were forwarded to the accounting officer of the Commission and
the Court of Auditors on 28 February 2017.

As the Court of Auditors has not issued its observations on the provisional accounts the attached overviews (Balance
Sheet, Statement of Financial Performance and Cash Flow Statement) are in a draft (provisional) status.

The annual accounts are drawn up in accordance with the Frontex Financial Regulation. The annual accounts of
Frontex include the financial statements and the report on the implementation of the budget. The report contains
more detailed information regarding the elements of the financial statements (see column ‘Note’).
The objectives of the financial statements are to provide information about the financial position, performance
and cash flows of Frontex.
The financial statements have been prepared according to the accounting rules adopted by the European
Commission’s accountant, following the principles of accrual based accountancy where the economic outturn,
balance and cash flow are concerned. It should be noted that under Frontex Financial Regulation, the accounts
consist of the general accounts and the budget accounts, both kept in Euro.
The general accounts are accrual accounts which mean that the effects of transactions and other events are
recognised when those transactions or events occur (and not only when cash or its equivalent is received or paid).
They are based on the IPSAS (International Public Sector Accounting Standards). The general accounts allow for
the preparation of the financial statements as they show all revenues and expenses for the financial year and are
designed to establish the financial position in the form of a balance sheet at 31 December.
The budget execution is prepared on the basis of a modified cash accounting. In cash accounting system, payments
made and revenue received are recorded. Modified cash accounts means that payment appropriations carried over
are also recorded.
These provisions lead to discrepancies between the general accounts and the budget accounts.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the period.
According to Article 82 of Frontex Financial Regulation, Agency’s Accounting Officer shall send to the Commission's
Accounting Officer and the Court of Auditors by no later than 1st of March of the following year its provisional
accounts, together with the report on budgetary and financial management during the year.
The Executive Director shall send the final accounts, together with the opinion of the Management Board, to the
Commission’s Accounting Officer, the Court of Auditors, the European Parliament and the Council, by 1st of July
of the following year at the latest.
Finally, the final accounts are presented to the Council and Parliament for discharge.

ANNEX 8.
Evaluations and other studies finalised or
cancelled in 2016
In December 2015 the Commission concluded a Framework Contract – HOM.2015/EVAL/02-ABAC no 30-CE0740550/00-33 on impact assessments, evaluation and evaluation related services in the area of Migration and
Home Affairs. Frontex has expressed its interest to participate in that framework contract to use this in order to
outsource certain evaluation activities to an external contractor up to an agreed ceiling.
In February 2016 Frontex’ Management Board endorsed the Annual Evaluation Plan 2016 with the aim to carry out
four evaluations during the year.
1.
2.
3.
4.

Awareness as combined services provision – Monitoring and Risk Analysis Centre
Evaluation of Joint Operations and Pilot Projects – Process Design
Procedure and decision on use of technical equipment in Frontex coordinated operational activities
Framework Contract for Aerial Surveillance

As of mid-2016 the preparation and implementation of the European Border and Coast Guard Regulation required
shifts of resources in all parts of the organisation. The thereby increased workload across the Agency allowed to
implement only the following two out of the four initially planned evaluations
1.

‘Awareness as combined services provision – Monitoring and Risk Analysis Centre’

The cancellation of the “Monitoring and Risk Analysis Centre” section in the EBCG Regulation lead to
adaptation of the title to ‘Evaluation of the monitoring and risk analysis function’
Recommendations developed by the contractor [Ramboll] as follows
 New organisational concept
 Single data management policy
 Full spectrum of monitoring and risk analysis products and services
 Integrated user-friendly technical solutions for data collection and dissemination
2.

Evaluation of Joint Operations and Pilot Projects – Process Design

Recommendations developed by the contractor [ICF] as follows
 Assurance of linkage between evaluation tools and goals, objectives, indicators
 Amendment of the scope of the concept of evaluation
 Establishment of a dedicated team for the evaluation process
 Automatization of processes - Online platform
 Specific trainings on evaluation methods
 Improvement of the dissemination of best practices and findings
 Timing of the evaluations
The preparation of the action plans, in order to follow up on the recommendations and report on the progress
twice a year to the Commission and the Management Board, are currently in progress.
