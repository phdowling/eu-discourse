Frontex official publications fall into four main categories: risk analysis, training,
operations and research, each marked with a distinct graphic identifier. Risk analysis
publications bear a triangular symbol formed by an arrow drawing a triangle, with a
dot at the centre. Metaphorically, the arrow represents the cyclical nature of risk
analysis processes and its orientation towards an appropriate operational response.
The triangle is a symbol of ideal proportions and knowledge, reflecting the pursuit of
factual exactness, truth and exhaustive analysis. The dot at the centre represents the
intelligence factor and the focal point where information from diverse sources converges
to be processed, systematised and shared as analytical products. Thus, Frontex risk
analysis is meant to be at the centre and to form a reliable basis for its operational
activities.

Introduction

Concept

Methodology

The Eastern European Borders Risk Analysis Network (EB-RAN) performs monthly
exchanges of statistical data and information on the most recent irregular migration trends. This information is compiled
at the level of the Frontex Risk Analysis
Unit (RAU) and analysed in cooperation
with the regional partners on a quarterly
and annual basis. The annual reports offer a more in-depth analysis of the occurring developments and phenomena which
impact the regional and common borders, while the quarterly reports are meant
to provide regular updates and identify
emerging trends in order to maintain situational awareness. Both types of reports
are aimed at offering support for strategic
and operational decision making.

The Eastern European Borders Quarterly
statistical overview is focused on quarterly
developments for the seven key indicators
of irregular migration: (1) detections of illegal border-crossing between BCPs; (2) detections of illegal border-crossing at BCPs.
(3) refusals of entry; (4) detections of illegal stay; (5) asylum applications; (6) detections of facilitators; and (7) detections
of fraudulent documents.1
The backbone of this overview are monthly
statistics provided within the framework
of the EB-RAN (Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova) and reference period statistics from
common border sections of the neighbouring EU Member States (Norway, Finland,

1

Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania). The data are
processed, checked for errors and merged
into an Excel database for further analysis.

Structure
The first part offers a general Situational
overview broken down by main areas of
work of border-control authorities and police activities related to irregular migration.
The second part contains more in-depth
Featured risk analyses of particular phenomena. As the current issue of the Eastern European Borders Quarterly is the
third following a new approach adopted
for risk analysis quarterlies, the structure
of the report may still be subject to some
readjustments.

Please note that the analysis of this indicator
is now limited to EB-RAN countries
only, given that EU Member States have
transitioned to the European Union
Document-Fraud (EDF) reporting scheme.

Situation at the border

Border surveillance

Illegal border-crossing
During the fourth quarter of 2015, 1 105
persons were detected for illegal crossing of the regional and common borders
between BCPs. Detections of illegal border-crossing between BCPs decreased
by 41% in relation to the third quarter of
2015 (down from 1 882) but increased by
8.5% compared with the same quarter of
2014. The most significant drop in absolute
terms was observed for Ukrainians (from
483 in Q3 2015 to 236 in Q4 2015) and Vietnamese (from 254 in Q3 2015 to 122 in Q4
2015), and in relative terms – Syrians and
Georgians. By contrast, the detections of
Iraqis increased by 58%.

Figure 2. Detections between BCPs at the common borders and EU Member States’
land borders with the Russian Federation (data only from EU side) show that the
pressure in Q4 2015 as compared with the same quarter last year was the highest at
the Hungarian-Ukrainian border section

Almost 40% detections involved regional
nationals (of CIS and EaP countries), mostly
Ukrainians, Moldovans and Russians. Despite Ukrainian citizens being among the
most often detected for the illegal border-crossing between BCPs in Q4 2015,
only 19 of such cases were related to irregular migration, the rest being linked to
smuggling (30%) or reported under other
reasons (60%).
The remaining 60% of illegal bordercrossings involved non-regional nationals, mainly citizens of Afghanistan, Vietnam
and Iraq. Ukraine reported the highest
number of illegal border-crossings, followed by Hungary, Latvia and Belarus.

Facilitators
The number of detected facilitators decreased by 20% in the fourth quarter 2015
compared to the third quarter (from 59
in Q3 2015 down to 47 in Q4 2015) and increased by 47% in comparison to the same
period in 2014 (from 32 in Q4 2014).
With regards to nationalities, over 91% of
all facilitators detected in the analysed
period were citizens of the countries of
the region, with Russians ranking top, followed by Lithuanians, Belarusians, and
Ukrainians.

Figure 3. In Q4 2015, the number of facilitators increased significantly when compared
with Q4 2014, with Russian facilitators ranking top in the number of detections,

Border checks

Clandestine entries
In the fourth quarter of 2015 there was
only one case of clandestine entry involving a Moldovan citizen reported by Romania at a BCP at the country’s border
with Moldova.

Refusals of entry
The number of refusals of entry reported
during the fourth quarter 2015 at the common and regional borders decreased by
6% when compared to the third quarter
of 2015 (from 24 641 in Q3 2015 down to
23 103 in Q4 2015) and increased by 3% in
relation to the same period in 2014 (from
22 380 in Q4 2014). The vast majority of
refusals (89%) was reported at land borders, while the remaining 11% at air and sea
borders. Most refusals were issued by Poland, Belarus and Ukraine.
The top five refused nationalities were citizens of Ukraine, the Russian Federation,
Belarus, Moldova and Lithuania. In general, there were fewer Uzbeks, Georgians,
Tajiks, Russians, Azeris and Moldovans refused entry in Q4 2015 when compared to
Q3 2015, and more Lithuanians, Belarusians
and Ukrainians.
Poland mostly refused entry to Ukrainians, Russians, Belarusians, Tajiks, Armenians and Georgians. The highest drop in
refusals was reported among Ukrainians
and Georgians, while the most pronounced
growth was related to Tajiks.

Belarus, in turn, issued most refusals of
entry to Ukrainians, Lithuanians, Moldovans, Russians and Azeris.
The top five nationalities refused entry by
Ukraine were citizens of the Russian Federation, Azerbaijan, Moldova, Georgia and
Uzbekistan. The most significant drops
were related to Kirgiz, Tajiks and Uzbeks.

Document fraud
In the fourth quarter of 2015 detections of
persons using fraudulent documents reported by the three EB-RAN countries (Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine) decreased by
33% when compared to the third quarter
of 2015. Falls were observed in Belarus and
Ukraine with fewer document fraud cases
reported. Over 50% of detections were reported at airports and 32% at land borders.
With regards to nationalities, Moldovans
were still the most frequently detected
as fraudulent document users, followed
by Ukrainians and Georgians. Similarly to
the third quarter of 2015, the vast majority of fraudulent documents used were
passports.

Situation in the Eastern European region

Illegal stay in EB-RAN countries

In the fourth quarter of 2015 there were
7 015 detections of illegal stay reported by
the three EB-RAN countries, which represents a decrease of almost 9% when compared with the third quarter and a 12%
increase in relation to Q4 2014.

The top five nationalities detected for illegal stay in the EB-RAN countries were Russians, Ukrainians, Moldovans, Azeris and
Georgians. Citizens of the Russian Federation and Azerbaijan were mostly detected
by Ukraine, while the majority of Ukrainians, Moldovans and Georgians in were
reported by Belarus. Detections for illegal

stay decreased among Russians, Ukrainians
and Georgians, while the number of Azeris
and Moldovans increased when compared
with the third quarter of 2015.
Over 98% of detections of illegal stay were
reported on exit, of which 54% were recorded by Ukraine and 42% by Belarus.
