Frontex official publications fall into four main categories: risk analysis, training,
operations and research, each marked with a distinct graphic identifier. Risk analysis
publications bear a triangular symbol formed by an arrow drawing a triangle, with
a dot at the centre. Metaphorically, the arrow represents the cyclical nature of risk
analysis processes and its orientation towards an appropriate operational response.
The triangle is a symbol of ideal proportions and knowledge, reflecting the pursuit
of factual exactness, truth and exhaustive analysis. The dot at the centre represents
the intelligence factor and the focal point where information from diverse sources
converges to be processed, systematised and shared as analytical products. Thus,
Frontex risk analysis is meant to be at the centre and to form a reliable basis for its
operational activities.

Introduction
As of January 2016, three new countries
joined the Eastern Borders Risk Analysis
Network (EB-RAN) operating under the
EU-funded Eastern Partnership Integrated
Border Management Capacity Building
Project: Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia. Upon this extension, the network has
been renamed as the Eastern Partnership
Risk Analysis Network (EaP-RAN).

impact the regional and common borders while the quarterly reports are meant
to provide regular updates and identify
emerging trends in order to maintain situational awareness. Both types of reports
are aimed at offering support for strategic
and operational decision making.

Concept

The Eastern Partnership Quarterly statistical overview is focused on quarterly developments for the seven key indicators of
irregular migration: (1) detections of illegal border-crossing between BCPs; (2) detections of illegal border-crossing at BCPs;
(3) refusals of entry; (4) detections of illegal stay; (5) asylum applications; (6) detections of facilitators; and (7) detections
of fraudulent documents.1

The Eastern Partnership Risk Analysis
Network (EaP-RAN) performs monthly
exchanges of statistical data and information on the most recent irregular migration trends. This information is compiled
at the level of the Frontex Risk Analysis
Unit (RAU) and analysed in cooperation
with the regional partners on a quarterly
and annual basis. The annual reports offer a more in-depth analysis of the occurring developments and phenomena which

Methodology

of the EaP-RAN (Armenia, Azerbaijan2, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine) and
reference period statistics from common
border sections of the neighbouring EU
Member States and Schengen Associated
Countries (Norway, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary
and Romania). The data are processed,
checked for errors and merged into an Excel database for further analysis.

Structure
The general Situational overview broken
down by main areas of work of bordercontrol authorities and police activities
related to irregular migration. The current issue of the Eastern Partnership Risk
Analysis Network Quarterly is the second
following the extension of the network
with new members.

The backbone of this overview are monthly
statistics provided within the framework

Please note that the analysis of this indicator
is now limited to EaP countries only given
that EU Member States have transitioned to
the European Union Document-Fraud (EDF)
reporting scheme;

During the second quarter of 2016, 874
persons were detected for illegal border-crossing between BCPs by the Eastern Partnership Risk Analysis Network
(EaP-RAN) member countries.1 Ukraine
reported the highest number of detections, followed by Latvia and Hungary.
The most significant growth in detections was reported by Latvia at the Latvian-Russian border section.

members at all borders show that the highest pressure in Q2 2016 was recorded
at the Latvian-Russian border section, which showed the highest increase when

either to smuggling or to other reasons
not related to migration.
Non-regional migrants, mostly Afghans
and Vietnamese, constituted 43% of the
detected cases. Irregular migration was
the main reason for crossing the border
illegally for both nationalities.

At the Eastern Partnership and external borders 1 , 324 cases of illegal border-crossing were detected. More than
three-quarters of detections took place
at Ukrainian borders, involving mostly regional migrants, i.e. Ukrainians and Moldovans. Non-regional migrants (mostly
citizens of Vietnam, Turkey and Iran) were
detected in very low numbers.

At the common borders, detections of illegal border-crossing between BCPs increased by almost 17% compared with the
first quarter 2016 and dropped by 46%
in relation to the same quarter of 2015.

Facilitators
When compared with the first quarter
of 2016, the number of detected facilitators at the common borders significantly decreased (from 205 in Q1 2016
to 45 in Q2 2016). The drop can be explained by the definite closure of the socalled Arctic route.
As regards nationality, the facilitators
were mostly citizens of the Russian Federation (of Caucasus origin), Belarus and
Estonia.

Border checks

Clandestine entries
In the second quarter of 2016, there were
15 cases of clandestine entry attempts reported by Romania, Poland, Georgia and
Slovakia, and were related to Ukrainians, Russians, Moldovans and Georgians.

Refusals of entry
There were 25 604 refusals of entry reported during the second quarter 2016 by
members of the Eastern Partnership Risk
Analysis Network. Nearly 90% of refusals were issued at land borders, mostly
by Poland and Belarus. The top three refused entry were citizens of Ukraine, the
Russian Federation and Moldova.

At the common borders, refusals of entry issued by the EU Member States and
Schengen Associated Countries increased
by over 24% in relation to Q1 2016, and by
41% in relation to the same period of 2015.
The vast majority were reported by Poland with Ukrainian and Russian citizens
representing the top two nationalities.
Over 12 480 refusals were reported by
Eastern Partnership countries. 78% and
15%, respectively, were issued at land and
air borders. Belarus issued the majority of
refusals, followed by Ukraine and Georgia.

Document fraud
During the second quarter of 2016, there
were 125 detections of persons using
fraudulent documents reported by four
Eastern Partnership countries (Belarus,
Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine). A growing number of detections was registered
by all the reporting countries apart from
Belarus. Most detections were made by
Ukraine.
As regards nationalities, Ukrainians, Moldovans and Georgians were the most
frequently detected among fraudulent
document users.

THB from Nigeria on Russian student visas
According to some Moscow-based NGOs focusing on preventing human trafficking,
around 2 000-3 000 Nigerian girls are brought to the Russian Federation each year
for prostitution. Criminal groups appear to be taking advantage of Russian student visas, which are not easy to obtain, as universities must provide supporting documents
for the applications. Nigerians come to the Russian Federation officially to study and
then disappear for years into the sex trade and the authorities are unable to track them.
Girls in Nigeria are lured by promises of a well-paid job in the Russian Federation allowing them to reimburse the costs of the visa and the journey (estimated at the level of
USD 40 000). Surprisingly, even illiterate teenagers were being trafficked to the Russian
Federation on the basis of student visas officially to study at a university.
The Head of Mission at the Nigerian Embassy in Moscow is aware of Nigerians being
trafficked for sex to Russia and indicated that this phenomenon has been growing, as
it was not such a huge problem ten years ago.

The vast majority of detected fraudulent
documents were passports (90%). False
entry/exit stamps, visas and ID cards, accounted for 6% of all fraudulent documents reported.
Similar to the previous quarter, visa abuse
remained one of the main modi operandi
used by non-regional migrants in an attempt to enter the EU. Moreover, fraudulently obtained visas are likely to be used
by OCGs as an effective tool in their THB
activities. Open sources indicate that a
growing number of Russian student visas
are used for trafficking people from Nigeria to the Russian Federation (see box).

Situation in the Eastern Partnership region

Illegal stay in EaP-RAN countries

In the second quarter of 2016 there were
over 6 660 detections of illegal stay reported by Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and
Ukraine. The top five detected nationalities
included Russians, Ukrainians, Moldovans,
Georgians and Azerbaijanis. Citizens of the
Russian Federation and Azerbaijan were
mostly detected by Ukraine, while Ukrainians, Georgians and Moldovans tended to
be reported by Belarus.

Operation ‘Frontier-2016’ ongoing in Ukraine

99% of detections of illegal stay were reported on exit. Ukrainian borders were
the most affected ones, followed by Belarusian airports.

The main objectives of the operation are to perform regular checks of the most frequent
places of stay of irregular migrants as well as comprehensive inspections of roads, airports,
sea and river harbours and vessels to identify routes and channels of irregular migration flows across the territory of Ukraine. Moreover, the operation involves strengthened controls in border areas and cooperation with neighbouring EU Member States.

In the case of Belarus, Georgia, Moldova
and Ukraine only (reporting countries in
Q1 2016 and Q2 2016), detections of illegal
stay in Q2 2016 show a 6% increase when
compared with the first quarter of 2016.
The growth was mostly related to an increased number of Ukrainians and Moldovans detected for illegal stay on exit at
Eastern Partnership land borders.

Following the operation ‘Frontier-2015’, which led to the detection of over 1 970 irregular migrants, the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine launched the operation ‘Frontier-2016’ as of 20 April 2016. This national-scale operation includes close cooperation
of the majority of Ukrainian ministries and departments, as well as representatives of
law-enforcement authorities of the neighbouring countries.
The operation aims at combating irregular migration, human trafficking, illegal movement
of excise goods and smuggling of drugs and weapons across the state border of Ukraine.

According to open sources, from the beginning of the operation ‘Frontier-2016’ until midJuly, 705 persons were detected breaching the state border, over 1 600 persons abusing border regime detained and 102 irregular migrants apprehended. In addition, more
than 28 tonnes of contraband alcohol, nearly 1 million packs of cigarettes, 150 kg of amber, 38 kg of drugs and 120 weapons were seized.
