Frontex official publications fall into four main categories: risk analysis, training, operations and research, each marked
with a distinct graphic identifier. Risk analysis publications bear a triangular symbol formed by an arrow drawing a triangle,
with a dot at the centre. Meta­phorically, the arrow represents the cyclical nature of risk analysis processes and its orienta­
tion towards an appropriate operational response. The triangle is a symbol of ideal proportions and knowledge, reflecting
the pursuit of factual exactness, truth and exhaustive analysis. The dot at the centre represents the intelligence factor and
the focal point where informa­tion from diverse sources converges to be processed, systematised and shared as analytical
products. Thus, Frontex risk analysis is meant to be at the centre and to form a reliable ba­sis for its operational activities.

Executive summary
Large-scale migration flow and
border management / security
The numbers of non-regional migrants
transiting the Balkans reached unprecedented and extraordinary levels during
2015 with over 2 million illegal bordercrossings reported by all the countries
in the region. For comparison, this was
roughly 30 times more than in 2014.
For several years, the main routes
have remained the same: TurkeyGreece-former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary/Croatia and
Turkey-Bulgaria-Serbia-Hungary/Croatia.
This extraordinary situation resulted
in the largest migratory crisis in Europe
since the Second World War.
The steep increase in migratory pressure in the Eastern Aegean brought
about a range of political decisions from
attempts to prevent irregular migration
to inter-governmental agreements on
facilitated transit across the region towards the main destination countries
(e.g. Germany).
The countries in the region adapted to
the rising migratory flows in response to
the decisions taken by their neighbours
or the main destination countries. The
aim was to avoid a situation where people would become stranded.
These high-level decisions also reflected the enormity of the challenges
as numbers started to rise to several
thousand people per day. This resulted
in temporary inability of some countries
to perform border-control tasks as stipulated by relevant legislation, including

the Schengen Borders Code and the EURODAC regulation.
At the end of 2015, the European
Commission initiated an infringement
procedure against Greece and Croatia
for failing to implement the EURODAC
regulation.

Uncoordinated measures
and shift of focus resulting
in displacement / redirection
of the flow
After a summer of chaotic scenes when
many migrants forced their way across
different borders and thousands of people walked along the main highway
between Budapest and Vienna, the
Hungarian government decided to erect
physical barriers along the entire border with Serbia. As a consequence, the
flow shifted towards the Croatian-Serbian and then the Croatian-Hungarian
border. After the latter was also fenced
off by Hungary on 15 October 2015, the
flow was redirected towards the Croatian-Slovenian border.
During the entire period, the flow
continued to accelerate as migrants were
taking advantage of the organised transportation. This acceleration was also supported by confusing media messages
regarding restrictive or welcoming measures planned by the main transit and
destination countries (as migrants were
attempting to reach the destinations
which would welcome them ahead of
transit restrictions in the region or policy
changes in their destination countries).

Proper verification of the
country of origin remained
almost impossible
Even later decisions to restrict passage
for migrants who did not originate from
conflict areas (i.e. not Syrian, Iraqi or
Afghan) were difficult to implement.
Verifying the country of origin of persons at the moment of the crossing remained very limited. Most authorities
were confronted with a lack of interpreters and screeners, and mainly relied on
the documents that migrants presented
to attest their nationality. None of these
documents bore security features, which
made them easy to abuse.

More coordination after
October 2015
At the end of October 2015, the European
Commission organised a mini summit
where leaders representing Albania, Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Germany,
Greece, Hungary, Romania, Serbia and
Slovenia agreed to improve cooperation
and step up consultations between the
relevant authorities along the route.
They also agreed on a 17-point plan of
pragmatic operational measures that
eventually made it possible for the countries to start reapplying national bordermanagement legislation and the EU law
in this field.

Main lessons learned
The unprecedented massive flows of
people along the Western Balkan route
proved to be unmanageable for the border authorities involved. These flows also
exposed clear limits of border controls in

the absence of uniform EU-wide migration and asylum policies.
All contingency plans were designed
with lower numbers in mind and with
a presumption that the arriving people
would not refuse to follow the existing
procedure.
Some people also refused to be registered and wanted to continue their
journey by crossing to the next country
as quickly as possible. Clashes with the
authorities and between different eth-

nic groups were regular occurrences in
such circumstances.
Perhaps the biggest lesson is the fact
that perceptions and rumours matter a
lot. Many would-be migrants from Syria,
Iran, Iraq, North Africa or Pakistan decided to travel to Greece en masse after
they became convinced that the Western
Balkan route was open, fast and cheap
and that some EU Member States would
accommodate them. These perceptions
proved to be very difficult to dispel.

In conclusion, the 2015 migratory crisis resulted from a mixture of compounding factors, including the prolonged war
in Syria, advancing Daesh and a growing threat from Taliban insurgency in
Afghanistan. However, by far the most
influential factors allowing for the astonishing daily figures were the introduction of a facilitated transport corridor
across the Western Balkans and a temporary suspension of national and EU border-management legislation.

1. Introduction
As was the case with the previous five is­
sues, the Western Bal­kans Annual Risk Analysis
(WB-ARA) 2016 has been prepared in cooperation between the risk analysis units
of the competent bor­der-control authorities of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina
(BiH), Kosovo*, the former Yugoslav Re­
public of Macedonia (FYR Macedonia),
Mon­tenegro, Serbia and the Frontex Risk
Analysis Unit (RAU).

all the mentioned Western Balkan countries actively participate.
The WB-RAN was established following the pro­posal made by Frontex in May
2009.
The WB-ARA 2016 builds on knowledge from previous editions of the annual report, re­porting provided within
the WB-RAN throughout 2015 and other
privileged reporting availa­ble to Frontex.

The joint analytical activity is an integral part of the Western Balkans Risk
Analysis Net­work (WB-RAN), in which

The WB-ARA 2016 is structured around
the following elements: (1) a description of
the general context in which border controls at common borders occur; (2) annual

Frontex · Western Balkans Annual Risk Analysis 2016

risk as­sessment, which includes identification and detailed description of the main
risks affect­ing both the area of the Western
Balkans and Member States or Schengen
Associated Countries; (3) outlook and mitigating actions summary, which take into
account relevant EU policy developments.
The statistical annex of the WB-ARA
2016 includes summary tables describing the key indicators of irregular migration in detail.
The Frontex Risk Analysis Unit would
like to thank all WB-RAN and FRAN
members for their active participation throughout 2015 and their valuable input.

2. Methodology

2.2. C
 hanges in data scope
after Croatia’s entry to
the EU

In order to facilitate the exchange of
infor­mation between WB-RAN countries and Frontex, the Commission and
Frontex set up a secure Internet platform
on the Euro­pean Commission’s Circa
server similar to what is available for
the FRAN. This platform (transformed
into CIRCABC during 2012) is used exclusively by WB-RAN countries and the
Frontex Risk Analysis Unit. WB-RAN sta­

sis presented in the Frontex Risk Analysis
for 2016 (ARA 2016).
Furthermore, all WB-RAN countries
contributed additional information and
graphical material following the 2015
An­nual Analytical Review meeting that
was held in Warsaw.
Open sources of information were
also ef­fectively exploited. Among others, these sources included reports issued

tistical data have been available since
Janu­ary 2009.
The core of monthly statistical data
from WB-RAN and neighbouring FRAN
countries (only common borders) is focused on six key indi­cators of illegal
migration: (1) detections of illegal bordercrossing; (2) detections of fa­cilitators;
(3) detections of illegal stay; (4) re­fusals
of entry; (5) asylum applications; and
(6) detections of false documents.
In addition to this core data set, other
data availa­ble to Frontex were also used.
Those include data of the European Union Document-Fraud Risk Analysis Network (EDF), Turkey-Frontex Risk Analysis
Network (TU-RAN) and reporting from
different Joint Operations coordinated
by Frontex. Importantly, as agreed by
all WB-RAN members, Kosovo* Border
Po­lice was invited to participate in the
work of the network (starting from 2014).
Many other qualitative and quantitative sources were also used, in
particular, bi­monthly and quarterly analytical reports of both Member States and
WB-RAN coun­tries, Frontex reporting in
the context of the Post Visa-Liberalisation Monitoring Mecha­nism and analy-

by govern­ment agencies, EU institutions
and interna­tional or non-governmental
organisations. Additional input was provided by both Mem­ber States / Schengen
Associated Countries and WB-RAN countries during the Western Balkans Expert
Meeting on 10 March 2016.

2.1. Quality of available data
Consistent with other law-enforcement
indi­cators, variation in administrative
data related to border control depends on
several factors. In this case, the number
of detections of ille­gal border-crossing
and refusals of entry are both functions
of the amount of effort spent detecting
migrants and the flow of irregu­lar migrants. For example, increased detec­
tions of illegal border-crossing might be
due to an actual increase in the flow of
irregular migrants, or they may in fact
be an outcome of more resources made
available to detect migrants. In exceptional cases, additional re­sources may
produce an increase in reported detections while effectively masking the ac­
tual decrease in the flow of migrants,
result­ing from a strong deterrent effect.

Important changes in the collection and
use of data for Western Balkans analytical products were introduced upon Croatia’s joining the EU in July 2013. Firstly,
data for Slovenia, which now has no external borders with non-EU West­ern Balkan countries, have not been included
in the report since the third quarter of
2013. Slovenian historical data were also
excluded from the tables in order to make
the com­parison with previous quarters
analytically meaningful.
Secondly, as the Croatian-Hungarian
and Croatian-Slovenian border sections
have now become internal EU borders
they are no longer cov­ered by this report.
Thirdly, after joining the EU, Croatian
data on illegal stay data are limited to
detections at the border. More precisely,
Croatia’s ille­gal stay data only include
cases detected on exit, while inland detections are not included. The analysis
of the illegal stay indicator takes this
fact into consideration.

2.3. C
 hanges in data scope
after Kosovo’s* entry
to the WB-RAN
Starting from the first quarter of 2014
data from Kosovo* on key indicators of
irregu­lar migration have been included
in the reporting, making it possible to
get a more comprehen­sive picture on
the irregular movements in the region.
However, as there are no histori­cal data
available for Kosovo*, the new data do,
to some extent, affect the compari­sons
of the examined period with previ­ous
quarters. When necessary for analytical
purposes, some comparisons are made
ex­cluding data from Kosovo* and this is
noted in the text.

bania’s border with Greece ranked close
behind with roughly 126 000 more Albanians exiting.
However, judging by the number of
Serbians, Albanians, Bosnians and nationals of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia reported for overstay
in EU Member States / Schengen Associated Countries during 2015, the situation appears more stable. Specifically,
out of 700 000 more exits to the EU only
roughly 43 000 persons were reported for

illegal stay in the block. Nonetheless the
highest ratio between the over stayers
and the higher number of exits is in the
case of Albanians (i.e. 1:4 or 29 000 over
stayers to 126 000 more exits to Greece
than entries). The second highest ratio
is for Serbians, scoring at (1:30 or 8 700
over stayers to 261 000 more exits across
the borders with Hungary, Romania and
Croatia). For the other two nationalities
the ratios are considerably lower.

Serbia’s borders were by far the busiest re­gional borders in terms of regular
passen­ger flow. More precisely, there
were over 58 million entries and exits recorded by the Serbian authorities making up 40% of the re­gional passenger
flow. Border crossings took place mostly
at Serbia’s borders with Cro­atia, Bosnia
and Herzegovina, and Hungary.
The second busiest borders, with 29%
of the regional share of regular passenger
flows, were those of Bosnia and Herzegovina, whose border with Croatia accounted for 70% of the almost 42 million
entries and exits reported.
Around 61% of the entries and exits at the regional level were related to
passen­gers who were not nationals of
the report­ing country (the so-called foreign travellers).
There were around 1 440 000 more entries (9%) than exits by foreign travellers
mainly from the direction of Hungary,
with the largest discrepancies in July
and August, sug­gesting a largely bona
fide nature of these movements (busy
holiday season).
The ratio between entries and exits
can serve as a proxy measurement of
bona fide travel patterns, since it provides an indication of how many persons
exited a country and later returned in a
given fixed period, and hence did not
overstay their legal period.
Overall, at regional level there were
700 000 (5%) more exits by citizens of the
regional countries who share a common
border with EU Member States than entries by the same nationalities (Fig. 4).
The biggest discrepancy between exits
and entries appear to be at Serbia’s border with Hungary, where 257 000 more
Serbians exited their country than returned. The second largest difference was
related to nationals of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia at this country’s border with Greece, where 160 000
more people exited than returned. Third
place was occupied by Bosnia and Herzegovina’s border with Croatia, with a
difference of roughly 133 000, while Al-

3.2. Refusals of entry
In 2015, 41 800 decisions to refuse entry
were issued, a slightly lower number
(-2%) than that of the previous year. However, what stands out is the large number
of refusals issued to Turkish nationals,
i.e. 73% more than in 2014. This increase
was mainly registered in the second half
of the year. If a high number of refused
Turks during Q3 can be regarded as relatively normal (as it is generally associated with the seasonal trend of workers
returning to the EU after the summer
holiday period), the sustained increase
in Q4 likely indicates that more of these
nationals try to take ad­vantage of the unprecedented migratory flow in order to
irregularly reach Western Europe.
As in the previous year, a large major­
ity of refusals of entry were issued at the
land borders (89%), while the remaining
11% were mostly reported at the air borders. Interestingly, Turks received 58%
of the refusals issued at the air borders,
ranking first at this border type, and a
little over 3% of the decisions issued at
land borders, where they occupied the
sixth position. This situation indicates
that Turkish na­tionals largely prefer travelling by air (i.e. they received over 2 600
refusals at air borders and over 1 200 at
land borders).
Most of the refusals reported by the
neigh­bouring EU Member States were
issued to nationals of Western Balkan
countries (92%). In turn, as regards refusals issued in the six countries of the
region, 34% concerned local residents,
followed by nationals of EU Member

States / Schengen Associated Countries
(31%) and Turkish nationals (15%).
The overall number of refusals issued
to the non-regional nationalities associated with the migratory flow originating
from Turkey/Greece continued to account
for a very low share of the total (i.e. only
433 refus­als, or just over 1% of the total
were issued to persons of nationalities
representing the top five non-regional
migrants detected in 2015 – SYR, AFG,
IRQ, IRN and PAK). This seems to confirm that the non-regional transiting
flow either directly targets the green borders or takes advantage of the orderly

the Croatian-Serbian border, especially
in the final quarter.
As the non-regional flow reached record values during the second half of
2015 (at some point over 12 000 detections
per day), it unsurprisingly overwhelmed
border-con­trol authorities’ screening and
registration capacities (i.e. roughly 38% of
the non-regionals being reported as ‘un­
known nationality’) and causing a shift
in fo­cus from ensuring border-control
measures to providing an orderly transit to migrants in an attempt to avoid
build-ups of migrants and tensions with
the local population.

transit policies.

At the same time, around 38 000 illegal
border-crossings by regional migrants2
were reported, a number similar to that
of 2014 and which represents around 2%
of the total detections in the Western Bal­
kans in 2015. The largest proportion of
such detections occurred in the first quarter of the year and was associated with
the outflows from Kosovo*. These flows
subsided at the end of February due to
an array of concerted international meas­
ures implemented in the origin, transit
and destination countries. For the rest
of the year the regional flow remained
low. Actually, it was even below the ex­
pected seasonal trend and was confined
to the southern part of the region, mainly
linked to the Albanian circular migration
to Greece. However, the lower than usual
numbers of regional migrants especially
in the second half of the year could also
be attributed to the possibility that many
of them passed undetected taking advantage of the massive transiting flow.

3.3. Irregular migration
In 2015, roughly 2 044 000 illegal bor­dercrossings by non-regional migrants1 en
route from Turkey, Greece and Bulgaria
were reported at the common and regional borders. This is a number that is
unprece­dented and beyond comparison
with any previous period (being over 19
times higher than the total of such detections over the past six years). The volume of the flow was steadily increasing
in the first half of the year, running at
levels slightly above those of the fi­nal
months of 2014, before significantly ac­
celerating in the third and fourth quarters to peak in October at over 577 000
detections.
As in previous years, this flow entered
the region across its southern common
borders with Greece and Bulgaria, before transiting it northwards and exiting across the Hungarian-Serbian and

4. Annual risk assessment
In line with the previous edition of this
annual report, the WB-ARA 2016 considers risk as defined by the updated
CIRAM: a function of threat, vulnerability and impact (see Fig. 6). Such
an approach endeavours to emphasise risk analysis as a key tool in ensuring the optimal allocation of resources

within constraints of budget, staff
and efficiency of equipment.
According to the model, a ‘threat’ is a
force or pressure acting upon the external
borders that is characterised by both its
magnitude and likelihood; ‘vulnerability’ is defined as the capacity of a system

to mitigate the threat and ‘impact’ is determined as the potential consequences
of the threat. In this way, the structured
and systematic breakdown of risk is presented in the annual risk assessment.
The current issue largely builds on
the main findings from the same exercise for the drafting of the WB-ARA 2015.

time lag, which was basically the time
mi­grants needed to organise their onwards movements (Fig. 7).
With this observation in mind it can
be considered that the record values
regis­tered in the Western Balkans during 2015 are a direct consequence of the
unprecedented number of migrants re­
ported in the Eastern Aegean in the same
period (the highest number since data
collection began, roughly nine times
larger than the totals recorded for this
area over the past five years).
Considering that the migratory flow
transiting the Western Balkans is generally the same as that running via the
Eastern Mediterranean, the difference
in reporting between the two routes may
seem odd. However, this is only natural
as a migrant transiting the Western Balkans needs to go across several border
sections on the way to his destination

The non-regional migration flow transiting the Western Balkans is mainly a
function of the developments occurring at Turkey’s bor­ders with Greece and
Bulgaria and thus, by extension, in the
Middle East. The continued insecurity
in this area throughout 2015 pro­vided
for an ever increasing pool of would-be
migrants and / or refugees to accumulate on Turkish territory ready to use all
known migra­tion routes towards the EU.
The direct link between the non-regional migration flow transiting the
Western Balkans and the one affecting
Greece’s borders especially in the Eastern Aegean Sea was also maintained during 2015. Specifically, the pressure from
the Aegean Islands manifested itself on
the Western Balkan route with a certain

However, in 2015 roughly 2 044 000 illegal border-crossings by non-regional

unprecedented and beyond comparison
with any previous period (being over 19

In the course of the year, two different trends could be observed in the volume of the flow. While in the first half

In response to the rising migratory flow
the most affected regional countries implemented a series of sometimes contradictory measures. These measures
ranged from relaxed entry / stay provisions for those expressing a wish to
claim asylum, though attempted border closures (of GRC-MKD, SRB-MKD sections), successful closures (of HUN-SRB
and HUN-HRV border sections), all the

plemented by offering planned and organised bus and train transportation
across most of the region.
Starting at the end of June, the Asylum
Law in the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia was amended to allow 72-hour
legal transit and access to public transportation to migrants expressing an intention to claim asylum. Furthermore, at
around the same time the authorities of
affected countries started to announce restrictive measures in mass media. These
developments were amongst the first in
a series of factors which accelerated the
migratory flow. More exactly, migrants
took advantage of the legal travel opportunities in the former Yugoslav Republic
of Macedonia and accelerated their tran­
sit in order to reach the desired EU Member States/Schengen Associated Countries
in time before the Hungarian or Croatian
authorities toughened their migration
policies and imposed border restrictions.
Furthermore, migrants’ per­ceptions influenced by mixed media mes­sages about
destination countries also played an important role in accelerating and attracting the flow.
As a consequence, en masse migration (groups of 500–1 000 people) became
common starting from the third quarter.

their territories, the most affected countries adopted high-level political decisions, shifting the focus from preventing
irregular migration to concluding agreements on directed transit across the
region towards the main destination
countries.
Following these decisions migrants
went from trying to organise their own
trips to relying on the organised transportation provided by the authorities.
As a side effect, these decisions de
facto limited border guards’ possibility
of preventing illegal border-crossing.
Namely, instead of ensuring the fulfilment of the legal conditions for border
crossing through the designated BCPs,
border guards found themselves simply
enforcing an orderly passage of irregular
flows, issuing various registration papers and trying to maintain public order
in the border area and at train stations.
This shift of focus to organising and
guiding the migratory flow across certain points at common and regional borders led to an immediate transfer of the
pressure from certain areas to others.

Shift of focus from border
management and security to
migration flow management

The later decision to restrict passage for
migrants who did not originate from
conflict areas (i.e. not Syrians, Iraqis
or Afghans) was difficult to implement.
Although these actions were taken in

countries along the main route (SVN,
HRV, SRB, MKD) the possibility of verifying the nationalities of persons at the
moment of the crossing remained very
limited. Most of the implementing countries were confronted with a lack of interpreters and screeners, and mainly relied
on the documents presented by migrants
which bare no security features and in
many cases could be falsely obtained or
easily altered.
Furthermore, in November the Greek
authorities noticed that Syrian, Afghan
and Iraqi migrants started to apply for
more than one registration certificate on
the Eastern Aegean Islands (even moving from island to island or returning
there from Athens) claiming to have lost
their documents. Some of these people
would sell the superfluous certificates
to migrants of other nationalities that
would otherwise not be allowed to cross
the border from Greece to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
In this context, between 19 November
and 31 January, the authorities of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia discovered a large number of altered Greek
registration papers used by migrants trying to enter across the southern border.

The developments at the border between
Greece and the former Yugoslav Repub­
lic of Macedonia greatly influenced (and
were in turn influenced by) the decisions
taken in the region. 18 June 2015 can be
regarded as a very important date, as it
was the day when Skopje modified its
legislation to provide detected mi­grants
expressing the intention to claim asylum
with documents allowing them 72 hours
to move within the country and reach one
of the reception centres.
Although it was taken as an attempt
to reduce the impact of difficult transit

on the health and security of the migrants, this decision coincided with the
surge in the transiting flow. While mitigating the risk to the wellbe­ing of migrants by giving them no reason to take
dangerous routes or interact with criminal groups, the new legislation had a
significant impact on the border management in that it was used by mi­grants
for transiting the country rather than
reaching reception centres.
Following the increase of the flow, organising onwards transportation became
a necessity. Although migrants were at
first simply given access to public trans-

corresponded to the surge registered in
the Eastern Aegean Sea, and was most
notable during the second half of the
year, with a peak of over 8 600 detections in October.
During 2014, the border between Bulgaria and Serbia appeared to primarily
reflect the pressure originating at the
Bulgarian-Turkish land border and accumulating in Bulgaria, as the stranded
migrants were searching for a way out.
However, in 2015 this correlation does
not appear so clear anymore as the numbers at the Bulgarian-Turkish land border
were low compared to those reported at

ure 9 reveals an important correlation
between the trends of monthly detections in the Eastern Mediterranean and
at the Bulgarian-Serbian border. A possible explanation would be that some
migrants manage to cross undetected
into Bulgaria either directly from Turkey across the common land border or
indirectly across the internal EU border
from Greece.
Information from January 2016 shows
that migrants travel overland from Turkey to Bulgaria by taking the Easternmost route (i.e. crossing the border in
the areas of Malko Tarnovo or Bolyarovo).

port in order to reach reception centres,
the situation quickly escalated leading
to high-level decisions to increase the
number of trains and buses (as a way of
easing the pressure in the border area
and preventing conflicts with the local
population). These actions set the stage
for what later became the first part of
a trans-regional orderly transportation
corridor based on various agreements.
Later attempts at filtering the flow
(i.e. allowing entry only to migrants
originating from conflict areas, specifically Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis starting from 19 November), apart from being
difficult to implement due to a lack of
screeners and facilities, resulted in the
refused migrants accumulating on the
Greek side of the border. On several occasions groups of migrants tried to force
their way through the border.
In response, the authorities had a protective wire fence built in the most critical places along the border with Greece
(covering roughly 30 kilometres in total).
This fence was designed to prevent chaotic crossings and stream-line the flow
through designated points where orderly
checks could be performed.
Also in the south of the region, the
Bulgarian-Serbian border section appears to have significantly gained importance as an entry point. More exactly,
over 48 000 illegal border-crossings between BCPs were reported from this section during 2015, a number almost 60
times higher than that of the previous
year. This massive increase also largely

(+196%) can still be observed in this particular area during the first weeks in
2016 compared with the same period of
2015. This could be linked to the restrictive measures at the border between the
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
and Greece, but may also be the result of
increased protection measures accompanying further extension of the engineering technical obstacle on that particular
border section.

Trying to prevent crossings at their
common land border with Turkey, the
Bulgarian authorities decided to extend
the current 30-kilometre engineering
technical obstacle and the integrated
border surveillance system implemented
in previous years. These systems are envisioned to ultimately cover a total of 132
kilometres of the common border with
Turkey. By mid-February 2016, an addi-

tional 36 kilometres were covered and
construction was ongoing for another 14.
The Greek-Albanian border section
appears to have become less attractive
for the non-regional migrants in the analysed period. Namely even in the context
of the unprecedented migratory flow affecting the region, this section reported
17% fewer illegal border-crossings compared with 2014. This decrease appears
to have been mostly due to a deflection
of the flow caused by the increased attractiveness of the more direct routing
from Greece to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia starting from June.
The number of detections at the
Greek-Albanian border was especially
low after June, when a significant increase was reported at the Greek border
with the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia, indicating a deflection in
the pressure towards the latter section.
The northern part of the region
remains the main exit point
Most of the non-regional migrants entering the Western Balkans across the
southern common borders with Greece
and Bulgaria later transited Serbia as
they moved north, at first towards Hungary and then Croatia. Therefore, the
border between Serbia and the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was one
of the most affected by the transiting
flow during 2015, registering a 155-fold
increase in number of detections in relation to 2014.
This border section was also affected
by the change in approach regarding
migration. At the beginning of the migratory surge (beginning with the third
quarter), the Serbian authorities implemented a series of prevention measures
(such as increasing the number of personnel, enhanced control activities and
opening a new migrant reception centre
in Presevo). Later, however, the focus
was shifted from prevention measures
to organised orderly transit, registration
and onwards transfer by public transport
(i.e. towards Hungary and after September towards Croatia).

The Hungarian-Serbian border section was the exit point from the region
preferred by the non-regional migrants
between January and mid-September
2015. In response to the high number of
transiting migrants, the Hungarian authorities started preparing a set of countermeasures to protect their borders. The
whole process of preparing the new border measures (i.e. public debates, migration-related banners on the streets,
a national consultation of the population, and various legislative proposals)
was widely reported in mass media. This
wide media coverage of these preparatory

Recent initiatives that could affect
the migratory flow in the future

measures appears to have played an important role in accelerating the migratory flow, as people tried to reach their
destinations ahead of the restrictions’
entry into force.
Later, in mid-September these preparations resulted in the finalisation of
a fence along the green border between
Hungary and Serbia, adoption of legislation incriminating any damage done
to the fence and other measures to direct the flow through designated transit areas.
Before these measures were implemented (January–mid-September)
roughly 193 000 illegal border-crossings
associated with non-regional migrants
were reported from this section. Afterwards, the flow dramatically dropped to
a total of 930 illegal crossings reported
between October and December.
However, despite the drop reported at
the Hungarian border, the overall flow
did not stop but was merely diverted
to­wards the Croatian-Serbian section
while its volume continued to increase.
As a re­sult, this last section went from
reporting an average of 66 de­tections per
month between January and August to
being confronted with a flow of almost
557 000 between mid-September and December, thus becoming the main exit
point from the region.
Following the surge in numbers,
the authorities began organising onward transportation of the migrants
first towards Hungary and then Slovenia (mid-October).

ian, Afghan and Iraqi nationals. Starting
from February 2016, a series of high-level
meetings of the heads of the regional police services were organised and additional restrictive measures were agreed.
The new measures ranged from requiring
migrants to be in possession of an identity document and filtering out certain
nationalities to allowing the possibility of introducing daily transit quotas.
At the beginning of March 2016, Slovenia and Croatia announced the decision
to close the transit corridor altogether
and return to the rule of law and full
implementation of the Schengen Border Code. In this respect, only persons
who fulfil the legal entry conditions or
those who express the wish to apply for
asylum and later remain on their territories will be allowed to enter the respective countries.
The implementation of these measures produced a cascading effect of daily
quotas and green border closures along
the route, which consequently limited
the flow of migrants via the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and led to
a growing number of people stranded in
the border area of Idomeni, in particular, and Greece, in general.

In the period between November 2015 and
February 2016, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia and Austria implemented an array
of concerted measures aimed at tackling
and curbing the unprecedented flow of
irregular migrants moving towards the
EU via the Western Balkans.
The first such measure was taken at
the end of November 2015, when the
authorities of the most affected countries decided to only allow transit of Syr-

Top nationalities
Contributing to the record number of detections, Syrians and Afghans were the
two main reported nationalities, with
35% and 15% shares of the non-regional
flow, respectively. However, in terms of

absolute numbers, both nationalities
registered high increases compared with
the previous year (over 56- and 28-fold
rises, respectively). Iraqis, Pakistanis
and Iranians completed the top five of
the known non-regional nationalities,
with numbers ranging from 20 000 for
Iranians and over 140 000 for Iraqis.
Together, these top five nationalities
accounted for roughly 60% of the total
non-regional flow transiting the Western Balkans.
As the non-regional flow reached record values in the second half of 2015 (at
some point over 12 000 detections per
day at a single border section), it unsurprisingly overwhelmed border-control
authorities, impacting their screening
and registration capacities and causing
a shift in focus from ensuring bordercontrol measures to providing an orderly transit to migrants in an attempt
to avoid pressure build-ups and tensions
with the local population.
As a result, roughly 38% of the nonregional flow was reported as ‘unknown
nationality’4, mostly in the second half
of the year.
An interesting development was the
high rise in illegal border-crossings involving Iranians in the fourth quarter
(i.e. over sevenfold rise compared to Q3
and the highest reported number for this
nationality). This development could
be explained by better flow filtering capacities implemented by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and by
Serbia. These countries started to discover migrants with altered or forged
Greek registration papers used to declare
false nationality and be allowed passage
along with the accepted flow of Syrians,
Afghans and Iraqis.
Having shown a rising trend for
the most of the year, the final quarter
brought about a significant drop in detected Pakistanis. However, as it largely

coincides with the introduction of transit restrictions limiting the flow to just
Syrians, Iraqis and Afghans.
Following Asia, Africa was the second most reported region of origin of
detected migrants, registering an over
tenfold rise compared to 2014. The new
record in detections of African migrants
(a number higher than the sum total
of the previous six years) reveals a partial displacement of the pressure from
the Western towards the Eastern Mediterranean route and the Balkans in the
second half of 2015 as the news about
the availability of this option began to
spread. The most detected African nationalities were Somalis, Moroccans,
Eritreans and Nigerians.

Nationality swapping
Nationality swapping is a modus operandi
used by migrants hoping to gain benefits by falsely claiming to be citizens of
another country. The most typical reasons for this practice are the higher acceptance rate of asylum applications of
certain nationalities and the hope of
avoiding readmission.
In the case of migrants arriving in
Greece from Turkey, it was most beneficial to falsely claim Syrian, Iraqi or
Afghan nationality, considering that:

▪▪ Greece was granting six months of
suspension of repatriation for Syrian
and Iraqi nationals;
▪▪ The acceptance rate for Syrian, Iraqi
and Afghan nationals applying for
asylum in the EU is much higher
than for nationals such as Pakistani,
Moroccan, Iranian, etc.;
▪▪ The former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia introduced a measure to
allow only Syrian, Afghan and Iraqi
nationals to enter from Greece as of
19 November 2015;
▪▪ Criminal networks in Turkey and Syria
offer forged Syrian ID documents (ID
cards, passports, birth certificates,
etc.) of both low and high quality,
which helped substantiate false
claims of Syrian nationality.
In 2015, 173 042 migrants who claimed
Syrian nationality were screened; of

which 85.8% were assumed by screeners to be Syrian nationals. As regards
the rest, 8.6% were assumed to be Iraqi;
2.5% – Palestinian, 1% – Moroccan, and
2.1% were assumed to be of other nationality. Thus far in 2016, the breakdown
has been fairly similar.
In 2015–2016, as many as 26.8% of those
assumed to be Iraqi have falsely claimed
Syrian nationality. While the measures
taken by the authorities in some transit
and destination countries afford some to
Iraqi nationals, the benefits offered to
Syrians have induced over a quarter of
the screened Iraqis to falsely claim Syrian nationality.
The case of Moroccan migrants is different. Those arriving in Greece from Turkey are detained by the Greek authorities
and many of them are removed from the
country. Furthermore, even if a Moroccan

The greatest part were returned for using

being Syrian, Iraqi or Afghan.

national managed to make it to mainland
Greece, he/she would be refused entry at
the GRC-MKD border. Therefore, if a high
number of Moroccan nationals resorts to
nationality swapping, it could mean that
they are going to travel across the GRCMKD border legally, using the registration document which they acquired on
false grounds. If the ratio is low, then
it might be the case that they are going
to stay in Greece as long as they need to
plan their onwards journey, using the
‘parallel services’ of migrant smuggling
networks. The existence and increasing
involvement of such parallel services have
been reported by Hungary, where the
number of detections have been increasing since the beginning of 2016.
In 2015–2016 almost 40% of those migrants screened and who have been assumed to be Moroccan have claimed
Syrian nationality.

Underlying factors influencing
the irregular migration by the
most reported nationalities
Syrians
Syrians were the top reported nationality, accounting for 35% of the flow
transiting the Western Balkans, which
is hardly surprising, keeping in mind
that their country has been ravaged by
war for five years and that the number
of these nationals displaced in the immediate region reached almost 4.6 million in February 2016 (over 2.5 million
are registered only in Turkey).
Afghans
Afghan migrants were increasingly re­
ported for illegal border-crossing on
the Eastern Mediterranean route during 2015. With a total of over 213 000
detections, most of which (137 000) during Q4, these nationals accounted for
almost a quarter of the overall flow affecting this area.
As a consequence of the increased
detec­tions of Afghans in the Eastern
Aegean, their numbers also rose on the

West­ern Balkan route, where they were
the sec­ond most detected nationality
throughout 2015, very close behind Syrians. Specifically, in 2015 there were over
314 000 reported illegal border-crossings
by Af­ghans at the common and regional
bor­ders of Western Balkan countries.
This rising trend may be ex­plained
by the deteriorating security sit­uation
in Afghanistan after the retreat of the
International Security Assistance Force.
In this context open-source reporting
from the end of October 2015 suggests
that every night roughly 60 buses travel
from Kabul to Nimruz (the most common
last departure place for Afghan migrants
who intend to travel overland across Iran
and onwards).
However, the pressure observed on
the abovementioned routes could just
as well originate from internal developments in Iran or in Pakistan, as these
countries are as­sessed to be hosting over
5.5 million Af­ghans between them.

Specifically, UNHCR estimates around
950 000 to be registered as refugees,
while IOM esti­mates between 1 and
1.4 million to be un­documented. Moreover, media reports and Human Rights
Watch (HRW) data indicate a shrinking
third cat­egory of people with documents
but not registered as refugees (i.e. holders of tem­porary visas), who decreased
from roughly 760 000 to 450 000 between
June 2014 and August 2015).

Rough estimates of the presence
and status of Afghans in Iran
The Iranian Ministry of Interior estimated a total of around 3 million Afghans to be present on their territory,
which could be roughly divided into
three categories.

Main push factors from Iran
In 2012, the Iranian Bureau of Aliens
and Foreign Immigrants’ Affairs announced that they planned to return
1.6 million un­lawful persons and a total
of 900 000 ref­ugees to their countries of
origin by 2015. It was expected that by
2015, 200 000 ref­ugees would voluntarily
return and that 700 000 would no longer
be refugees (meaning that 700 000 of
the ref­ugee-card holders would not have
their cards renewed by 2015 and would
be ex­pected to return).
In June 2014, media reports emphasised in­creased pressures by the Iranian authori­ties to accelerate returns
of Afghans by stretching the tripartite
Iran-Afghanistan-UNHCR agreement on
voluntary returns.

Figure 17. Proof of Registration
issued to Afghans in Pakistan
Also apparently in line with this policy, media reports between June 2014
and August 2015 indicated a reduction
of approx­imately 310 000 in the number of the temporary visas offered to Afghans residing in Iran and not registered
as refugees. In June 2014, Iran renewed
temporary visas to 760 000 unregistered
Afghans for a period of six months (until
De­cember 2014). In December 2014, according to HRW, the Iranian authorities
again renewed temporary vi­sas but this
time only to 500 000 Afghans until June
2015. The latest such renewal was done in
August 2015 for a period of four months
and only covered roughly 450 000 holders of temporary visas.

Rough estimates of the presence
and status of Afghans in Pakistan
According to information presented by
dif­f erent sources, Pakistan hosts a minimum of roughly 2.5 million Afghans.
Out of this total, around 1.5 million
are registered in possession of Proof of
Reg­istration (only valid until June 2016)
while another 1 million are unregistered.

Main push factors from
Pakistan

1 million unregistered Afghans could face
repatriation within the next two years).

According to an IOM report, between
Jan­uary and May 2015, over 73 000 Afghans returned from Pakistan to Afghanistan. Out of these, 6 600 were reported
as ‘deportees’ en­forced by the authorities, while the rest, or roughly 67 000,
were reported as ‘sponta­neous returnees’.
The spontaneous returns are legal, under a tripartite agreement be­tween Pakistan, Afghanistan and UNHCR signed in
2007 and apparently still in force, which
allows voluntary repatriation of Af­ghans

Pakistanis

and sets an obligation for Afghani­stan
to accept and integrate them.
Moreover, at the end of November
2015, the authorities unveiled a plan to
repatriate the 1.5 million registered Afghans residing on their territory within
two years. Initially, it was announced
that their right to stay would not be extended beyond December 2015 but a sixmonth renewal was then offered until
June 2016. This short extension does not
significantly mitigate the uncertain future Afghan residents are facing in Pakistan. Logically, the announced policies
and uncertain future will constitute important push factors for both the registered and unregistered Afghans living
in Pakistan.
The fact that UNHCR can process
roughly 7 000 people per year and issue
refugee documents rec­ognised by the
government can be a mitigation factor
but it only has a limited effect (considering that 1.5 million registered and over

It may seem unusual that the number
of illegal bor­der-crossings of this nationality is higher in the Western Balkans
than at the first entry point in the East­
ern Mediterranean. However, the same
migrant may be re­ported several times
at different border sections while transiting the Western Bal­kans region.
Moreover, this differ­ence could also
be explained by the fact that the incentives for nationality swapping were high
in the Aegean Islands (as, for example,
Syrians were released quicker after apprehension) but then grad­ually disappeared in the Western Balkans (where
at first migrants faced no obstacles even
if stating their real nationality). Later
on, the new filtering measures introduced in the region (i.e. allowing passage
only to Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis) reinforced the incentive for nationality swapping also on this route, thus potentially
explaining a sudden drop in reported
Pakistanis during the final quarter.

Between January and December 2015
over 24 200 illegal border-crossings by
Pakistani migrants were detected on the
Eastern Mediterranean route, of which
roughly 12 500 during the fourth quar­ter.
As a knock-on effect, roughly 32 000 illegal border-crossings between BCPs by Pakistanis were registered on the West­ern
Balkan route, of which almost 20 000 in
the third and 8 000 in the fourth quarter.

Judging by open-source information,
there were no significant developments
in Pakistan that would jus­tify a rise in
the migration flow originating from this
country.
From a security point of view, the
Aus­trian Fact Finding Mission Report
of Sep­tember 2015 indicates that the situation in Pakistan, despite not being
perfect, has improved at national level
compared with 2013. Importantly, the
same report indi­cates that, statistically,
the security situa­tions in all FATA (Federally Administrated Tribal Areas) regions
has either already improved or is improving, due to the vari­ous military operations conducted by the authorities. This
is important, as a number of Pakistani
migrants interviewed in the course of
Frontex debriefing activities claim that
they originate from these areas and that
they were forced to leave the country due
to insecurity.
Analysing the country’s situation
from an economic point of view may
shed some light on the in­creased migratory flow observed in the analysed period.
Pakistan saw two consecutive years of
growth in 2014 (4.03%) and 2015 (4.2%).
While the GDP growth rate is commend­
able given Pakistan’s past performance,
it is still far below the 5–7% required to
ab­sorb new entrants into the labour force
and to check rising unemployment.

According to the State Bank of Pakistan, remittances5 from overseas migrants amounted to USD 18.4 billion in
the fis­cal year 2014–15, representing a
16% in­crease over the previous period.
Inflows from Saudi Arabia were the largest source of remittances, followed by
those from the United Arab Emirates,
together ac­counting for USD 9.8 billion.
Remittances from other Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) countries also amounted
to USD 2.1 billion. This means that the
GCC accounts for a 65% share of the remittances to Pakistan, while the rest is
divided between the UK and the United
States (a 22.8% share), and, to a lesser extent, Norway, Switzerland, Australia and
other coun­tries (a 7% share).
Remit­tances apparently account for
an increasing share of Pakistan’s GDP
(rising from 5.7% in 2011 to almost 7%
in 2015).6 Logically, the re­cent increase
in remittances also con­tributed to the
GDP growth registered in 2014 and 2015.
Moreover, according to a September
2014 study ‘Determinants of International
Migration in Paki­stan’, published in the
Mediterranean Jour­nal of Social Sciences7, 80%
of the surveyed persons declared low pay5

ing jobs as push factors for migration and
70% saw higher salaries as pull factors.
The same study indicates that ‘the
higher rate of poverty reduction among
the mi­grants’ families in the rural and
urban ar­eas of Pakistan, the greater
chance will be likely to the international migration’. In other words, the
bet­ter migrants are able to reduce the
pov­erty of their families through the
money they send home, the more attractive mi­gration becomes for others.
Therefore, the recent increase in the
amount of re­mittances received by Pakistan is likely to encourage more economic
migration, especially as the majority of
questioned persons see higher salaries
as the main pull factors for migration.
Judging by the size of remittances, the
oil-rich Middle Eastern countries remain
the first choice for Pakistani economic
mi­grants for the time being. However,
the fact that a considerable amount of
remit­tances also originates from EU
Member States / Schengen Associated
Countries, es­pecially the UK, Norway
and Switzerland, also highlights these
countries as impor­tant destinations.
Therefore, it is logical to assume that a
slow-down of infrastructure spend­ing by
GCC countries (likely if the oil prices remain low for a longer period) would neg­
atively impact Pakistani employees and
consequently reduce the flow of remit­
tances from this part of the world. In the
same context, if remittances originating

23 of 40

from EU Member States/Schengen Asso­
ciated Countries remain at the same level
or continue to increase, more Pakistani
economic migrants may opt for European countries as their final destinations.
Iraqis
Iraqi migration is assessed to be strongly
affected by the Syrian crisis, geographical proximity of Iraq to both Syria and
Turkey, and various perceptions held
by people.
Between January and December 2015,
roughly 496 000 Syrians (448 000 almost
equally divided between Q3 and Q4) and
about 93 000 Iraqis (70 000 in Q4) were
reported in the Eastern Mediterranean.
As a knock-on effect, roughly 710 000 il­
legal border-crossings between BCPs by
Syrians (432 000 in Q4) and 141 500 by
Ira­qis (112 000 in Q4) were registered on
the Western Balkan route.
Given the geographical proximity
of these two countries of origin to the
Eastern part of the EU and the Western Balkans, it is natural that the highest number of detected Syrian and Iraqi
mi­grants are reported on the two mentioned routes.
Perceptions generally play an important role in migration decisions. One of
such perceptions is that Syrian nationals
are of­f ered better prospects of moving to
and re­ceiving international protection in
the EU (ever since 2014 Syrians have not
been kept in closed reception centres after apprehension in Greece, and during
2015 they were the first allowed to leave
the Aegean Islands aboard ferries in order to go and register their asylum re­
quest in Athens).
This perception, along with the
geograph­ical proximity, the ethnic, cultural and lin­guistic similarities of Iraq
and Syria, may have encouraged many
Iraqis to migrate and falsely claim Syrian nationality in order to enter the EU,
often successfully.
Open-source reporting suggests an
increased propensity of Iraqis to leave
their country. Specifically, it appears
that during 2015 living standards in Iraqi

Kurdistan rapidly deteriorated as politicians hag­gled over power. Basic services,
electricity, cooking gas and water supply were not guaranteed and corruption
permeated the quasi-institutions of the
Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG)
and society at large.
Furthermore, the bad security situation in Iraq also plays an important role
in the decision to migrate. According to
the Internal Displacement Monitoring
Centre (IDMC), there were at least 4 mil­
lion internally displaced persons in Iraq
as of 15 June 2015, which can also be regarded as a push factor.

Addi­tionally, only 213 regional migrants, mostly Albanians (69%) were
reported trying to enter at BCPs. The
highest number of detections (roughly
65%) occurred at the common borders
with the EU, most likely linked to persons trying to avoid entry bans due to
previous visa liberalisation misuse.

Apparently, a growing proportion of
Iraqi Kurdistan population is frustrated
by recent developments and more eager
to leave the country. There are no precise
figures but the United Nations estimates
that more than 50 000 people left Iraq
in the summer of 2015.
Moreover, in September and Octo­ber
2015 Iraqi authorities were confronted
with an unusually high demand for new
passports (roughly 13 000 applications
per day), while flights from Baghdad
to Tur­key were booked for months in
advance.
All these factors suggest an increased
propensity of Iraqis to leave their country.

which represents a minor 3% increase
compared to 2014.
As regards reporting countries, Serbia con­tinued to rank first, with 59% of
all regional detections, followed by the
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, with a 13%
share each. Concerning na­tionalities,
Syrians continued to rank first amongst
false travel document users, followed by
Turkish and Iraqi citizens.
The most commonly used false docu­
ments were passports, ID cards, visas
and residence permits. Unsurprisingly,
the ID cards were all (85) EU Mem­ber
States’ documents, as they can be used
to move freely within the Schengen area
and the EU. As far as detections of false
passports are concerned, the majority (56
out of 140) were reportedly issued by EU
coun­tries, followed by Turkey (38) and
the Russian Federation (13).
The largest number of detections occurred at air borders (149), mostly on entry, involving Turkish, Syrian and Iraqi
nationals. Most detections (115) were reported from Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Interestingly, Turks ranked top
among document fraudsters at the regional air borders, with a number similar to that of the Syrians (35), and were
mostly reported by Bosnia and Herzegovina (27) and, to a lesser extent, by
Serbia (6).
The second place was occupied by the
land borders with 122 detections, mostly
reported on entry from Greece to the
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedo-

Illegal border-crossing at BCPs
In 2015, 929 non-regional migrants were
detected while trying to cross at BCPs
il­legally, most of them hiding in vehicles. This represents a 40% drop compared with 2014 and is the lowest figure
of such attempts since 2010.
This appears to be connected with
the fact that the orderly transit measures organised by authori­ties make travel
cheaper, safer and faster, thus partly
eliminating the need for more cumbersome organisation of passing through
BCPs clan­destinely.
In terms of na­tionalities, similar to
the situation at the green border, Syrians and Afghans were the most detected, together ac­counting for 81% of
all detections.

Frontex · Western Balkans Annual Risk Analysis 2016

Use of false documents
In 2015, there were 280 false docu­ments
used by non-regional migrants at the
common and regional Western Balkan
bor­ders reported within the WB-RAN,

nia and on exit across Serbia’s borders
with Hungary and Croatia. Interestingly,
Turks ranked second in detections of document fraud at the regional and common land borders, after Syrians. They
were mainly reported on exit from Serbia to Hungary or Croatia, being the top
reported nationality at both of these sections, which seems consistent with their
modus operandi of reaching the region by
air and then trying to illegally move towards the EU overland.

The fact that Syrians and Iraqis were
amongst the most detected nationalities of document fraudsters at both the
land and air border comes as no surprise
given their overall detections for illegal
border-crossing between BCPs. However,
the fact that Turks were detected in similar numbers to Syrians is interesting in
view of the fact that they did not even
feature among the top 20 nationalities
detected at the green border.
For example, Turks’ ratio between
the use of false documents and illegal

border-crossing between BCPs in the region is roughly one document fraudster
for three illegal border-crossers between
BCPs, a remarkably high rate compared
with that of Syrians, for example, which
is of one document fraud case for over
8 200 cases of illegal border-crossing.
Despite being a less common modus operandi, the use of false travel documents
should not be disregarded, as many affluent non-regional migrants choose this
option of illegal entry to the EU as more
comfortable, especially if they come by air.

During the analysed period there were

which represents a 2% share of the overall
illegal border-crossing detections in the region. The majority of the cases were registered between BCPs, while only 213 persons

for the persons origi­nating from the territory of Kosovo*, the ille­gal border-crossings by nationals of the region were by and

rest of the year mainly towards Greece).
The largest proportion of such detections occurred in the first quar­ter of the
year and was associated with the outflows from Kosovo*, which at the end
of February subsided due to an array of
concerted international measures im­
plemented in the origin, transit and des­
tination countries.
For the rest of the year the regional
flow remained low. Actually, it even
ran a little below the expected seasonal
trends and was confined to the southern
part of the region, mainly linked to the
Albanian cir­cular migration to Greece.

subsided, Albanians and became the top
reported nationality, with an 84% share of
the regional detections, mainly targeting
the Greek-Albanian border and, to a lesser
extent, the section between Greece and the
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
However, the lower numbers of regional mi­grants8 especially in the last
two quarters of the year could also be attributed to the fact that many of them
passed un­detected taking advantage of
the massive transiting flow affecting
the region.

Illegal stay in the EU
During the analysed period there were
almost 59 000 illegal stayers from the
Western Balkans re­gion reported at the
level of the EU Member States/Schengen

were citi­zens of the five visa-exempt

Amongst the five visa-exempt nationalities Albanians ranked first, registering a 35% in­crease compared to last year,

from these countries were reported by

Albanians were the most reported nationality in each of the top four coun-

Recent decisions mitigating the propensity for misuse of asylum
systems in Germany and Sweden
In Germany – Albania, Kosovo* and
Montenegro have been classified as safe
countries of origin, a decision bringing with it quicker processing, employment bans, and an obligation for
the asylum applicants to reside in specially designated facilities pending a
decision or return.
Furthermore, family reunification
has been suspended for the recipients
of subsidiary protection, while benefits
for unmarried persons were reduced
and obstacles to returns removed (i.e.
difference in the medical care systems
of the origin country is no longer considered ground for halting returns). A
central registration system is also underway, to avoid multiple registration
and distribute applicants according to
their origin within dedicated clusters
thus speeding up decisions and reducing afforded benefits.

In Sweden – besides the temporary reintroduction of border controls for ferry
connections with Germany and over the
bridge with Denmark and denying entry
to undocumented persons, new asylum
rules were also envisioned. These new
rules include granting temporary residence permits (not only permanent as
in the past), restricted right for family
reunification (only available to recipients of refugee status), tougher maintenance requirements (those granted
refugee status will have to prove ability to support their spouses and minor children in order to be granted the
right to reunite with them). Also assistance for adults is going to end when a
final rejection decision has been made.
These changes in the two much targeted countries are likely to partially
mitigate protection misuse not only
by Western Balkan nationals but by
migrants of all nationalities.

sequent asylum applications and misuse
in the second half of 2014 and the first
quarter of 2015.
Also in line with the situation observed in the previous year, Hun­gary and
Germany reported the highest numbers
of illegal stayers from Kosovo*, which
indicates these countries as the main
transit and destination countries for Kosovo* citizens. After the outflow from Kosovo* at the end of 2014 and in the first
quarter of 2015, the numbers of these
nationals detected in the EU decreased
significantly (i.e. from almost 7 000 in
February to a monthly average of 537 between April and December 2015). Compared to the same period of 2013, the
monthly average of 537 was still slightly
higher (+15%) but the situation significantly improved compared to 2014.

Document fraud in the
EU / Schengen area
In 2015, there were 2 857 nationals of
the five visa-exempt Western Balkan
countries and 42 Kosovo* citizens reported using false doc­uments on intra
EU / Schengen travels. Most cases were
reported by the UK (726), Italy (676) and,
to a lesser extent, Germany (240).
As regards nationalities, similar to
the situ­ation on entry at external borders, the great majority of false document users from Western Balkan
countries reported on intra EU / Schengen travel were Albanians, account­ing
for 94% of all such cases reported in 2015.
The detections on intra-EU / Schengen movements represent 69% of the total de­tections of false document users
from Western Balkan countries, while
only around 14% were reported on entry
from third countries.
In terms of documents, 3 149 false
documents were used in 2015 by the
visa exempt nationals of West­ern Balkan countries (3 102) and Kosovo* (47) on
intra-Schengen / EU travel. Most of these
documents were issued by EU Member
States / Schengen Associated Countries,
with Italy and Greece accounting for
a 68% share of the reported total.

4.3. Misuse of international protection system in the
Western Balkans by transiting migrants to avoid
detention and impede return procedures
In terms of misuse of international protection system in the Western Balkans by

gests that certain persons are transporting migrants in order to facilitate their

migrants as a way of avoiding detention
and continuing their trip there were no
major changes compared to the situation
in previous years, apart from the very
high increase in the overall numbers.
More exactly in Serbia during 2015 almost 580 000 persons expressed an intention to claim asylum, of which little
over 11 000 registered in reception centres and only 583 actually filled in an official application. A positive decision was
issued for 16 persons, 9 received subsidiary protection while 551 applications
were rejected as most of the people absconded before the procedure could be
finalised.
The situation was comparable in the
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, especially after it amended its legislation in June to allow an in-stages
asylum procedure similar to the one of
Serbia. More exactly, out of the roughly
390 000 expressed intentions for asylum,
only around 85 persons filled in an official application. Out of these just 3 positive decisions were reached while the
rest did not wait for the procedure to be
finalised and were therefore rejected.

onward transit for profit, such individuals are very difficult to prosecute because technically the persons they are
transporting have the right of free movement within the territory. However, facilitation became unnecessary after the
authorities started to organise the transportation of the flows themselves.
In the last two months of 2015, the decision to restrict entry to migrants who
did not originate from Syria, Iraq or Afghanistan could again justify a certain
need by some of the denied individuals
to resort to facilitation services for onward transit.
On 30 December, Serbia changed its
legislation and started providing regis-

Misuse of asylum provisions
hampers prosecution of
facilitators

250 000

The fact that expressing an intention
to claim asylum legalises the stay and
movements of the migrant for 72 hours
also has implications on police activities
against facilitators. Even if evidence sug-

tration certificates to migrants originating from conflict areas (SYR, AFG, IRQ)
which allow them 72 hours’ transit across
the country even if they do not express
an intention of applying for asylum. This
certificate is not likely to change much
in the migratory flow, as it continues to
allow transit of the territory.
This decision, however, further legalises the status of an irregular migrant
even if he/she is not in real need of international protection, which continues
to limit the efficiency of any border-control measures. Furthermore, given the
difficulties the authorities face in identifying the migrants (described in Section 4.1.), such certificates are likely to
contain fabricated personal data and may
spread confusion further along the route
where they can be taken for granted as
‘official documents’ (similar to the registration documents issued in Greece).

Reception centres generally
empty as people want to transit
quickly
Available information indicates that reception capacities are not a real issue
as migrants generally try to transit as
fast as possible (and the accommodation centres are generally empty). Only
in rare cases, when they need to wait for
some friends / relatives who fell behind
or when some of them need medical attention, do migrants choose to go to the

centres. In the majority of situations migrants avoid centres altogether trying to
transit as fast as possible or stay in hotels when they want to rest.

Widespread abuse of
registration documents – no
legal obligation or incentive
for people to be truthful about
their origin and personal status
In terms of false documents use, in late
2015 the phenomenon was largely linked

to documents migrants needed to prove
that they were of nationalities still allowed passage through the Western
Balkans (i.e. SYR, AFG, IRQ). More exactly, most of the false documents discovered by the former Yugoslav Republic
of Macedonia were not necessarily travel
documents which would allow a legal
border-crossing but other types of documents used by migrants as a means
to falsely claim Syrian, Afghan or Iraqi
nationality.

4.4. Smuggling of firearms across the regional and
common borders

ity (84) were citizens of the countries in
the region, followed by EU nationals (22)
and other third-country nationals (11).

In the attempt to create a better understanding of the international dimensions of firearms smuggling in the region

during 2015. This information was collated and standardised, and will serve as
a basis for comparison of the data which

Detections of weapons
(firearms / gas / converted)

and to facilitate more efficient solutions
through coherent and concerted regional
approaches, the Frontex Risk Analysis
Unit together with the representatives
of the Western Balkan countries taking part in the WB-RAN plan to launch
a pilot project aimed at a regular data
collection related to cases of firearms possession/smuggling detected by the border
police forces of the respective countries.
The pilot project is planned to cover
a collection of statistical data regarding
detections of firearms which will occur
during 2016 through standardised periodical reporting.
For the beginning provisional definitions / indications were created for the
collection of the most relevant information related to cases of firearms detections. These definitions / indications are
subject to improvement, based on practical experience and further discussions
which will take place throughout 2016.
The collection is also aimed to allow
reporting on the means of transport used
by type and registration (if available), the
nationality of the persons detected with
firearms, and various ways in which the
goods were transported / concealed. Also
the detection place should be generically
indicated by border section and type, BCP
(if available), or specific location (i.e.
close to the border, in the border area or
deeper inside the territory).
As a result of a data collection exercise
conducted within an organised workshop, a set of information was made
available on the detections registered

will be reported in the future thus facilitating analytical observations regarding the dynamics of the phenomenon.
In 2015, in the course of performing
their tasks the border police forces of the
six regional countries detected a relatively high number of weapons (firearms,
gas or converted), explosives, grenades
and ammunition pieces. At the regional
level, 140 weapons were reported (67 firearms, 67 gas, six converted all detected
in 76 cases), three and a half kilograms
of explosives (detected in three cases),
two grenades (in one case) and almost
13 000 pieces of ammunition (reported
in 44 cases).
As many as 117 persons were detected
while carrying the reported prohibited
goods, while in 12 cases the perpetrators
remained unknown (generally having
abandoned the goods). The great major-

Amongst the detected firearms, the majority were handguns (46), followed by
long rifles / shotguns (14) and fully automatic firearms (7). Regarding the gas
weapons, 55 were handguns and 12 were
long rifles or shotguns. Additionally, six
converted weapons of other types were reported. Most of the detections were reported in the border areas or at BCPs and
in few cases further away from the borders (outside the normal area of competence of border police forces).
Serbian authorities detected the largest number of weapons accounting for
60% of the overall regional totals. Serbian
data included firearms, gas weapons and
a lower number of converted weapons of
other types. The majority of these detections occurred at the border with Bulgaria
and also at the border with Hungary.

Bosnia and Herzegovina reported the
third highest number of weapons de-

Kosovo*), and two grenades reported by
Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Additionally, there were almost
13 000 ammunition pieces, reported at
regional level, most of them detected by

Montenegro. Montenegro ranked third
in detections of ammunition with most
cases reported at the border with Serbia.

As regards detections of explosives,
detonators and grenades at regional

which mostly reported such prohibited
goods at the borders with Albania and

not involve large quantities of smuggled weapons.
