Frontex official publications fall into four main categories: risk analysis, training,
operations and research, each marked with a distinct graphic identifier. Risk analysis
publications bear a triangular symbol formed by an arrow drawing a triangle, with
a dot at the centre. Metaphorically, the arrow represents the cyclical nature of risk
analysis processes and its orientation towards an appropriate operational response.
The triangle is a symbol of ideal proportions and knowledge, reflecting the pursuit
of factual exactness, truth and exhaustive analysis. The dot at the centre represents
the intelligence factor and the focal point where information from diverse sources
converges to be processed, systematised and shared as analytical products. Thus,
Frontex risk analysis is meant to be at the centre and to form a reliable basis for its
operational activities.

Introduction

Concept
The Western Balkans Risk Analysis Network (WB-RAN) performs monthly exchanges of statistical data and information
on the most recent irregular migration
developments affecting the region. This
information is compiled at Frontex Risk
Analysis Unit (RAU) level and analysed in
cooperation with the regional partners on
a quarterly and annual basis. The annual
reports offer a more in-depth analysis of
the developments and phenomena which
impact the regional and common borders, while the quarterly reports are meant
to provide regular updates and identify
emerging trends in order to maintain situational awareness. Both types of reports
are aimed at offering support for strategic
and operational decision making.

Methodology
The Western Balkans Quarterly is focused
on quarterly developments as reflected by
the seven key indicators of irregular migration: (1) detections of illegal bordercrossing between BCPs, (2) detections of
illegal border-crossing at BCPs, (3) refusals of entry, (4) detections of illegal stay,
(5) asylum applications, (6) detections of
facilitators, and (7) detections of fraudulent documents.1

1

Please note that the analysis of this indicator
is now limited to WB-RAN countries
only, given that EU Member States have
transitioned to the European Union
Document-Fraud (EDF) reporting scheme.

The data presented in the overview are
derived from monthly statistics provided
within the framework of the WB-RAN
and reference period statistics from common border sections of neighbouring EU
Member States (Croatia, Bulgaria, Greece,
Hungary and Romania). In addition, the
Western Balkans Quarterly is drawing from
FRAN Quarterly reports and also from
data analysed in the framework of other
risk analysis networks (FRAN, EDF-RAN).

Structure
The first part offers a general situational
overview broken down by main areas of
work of border-control authorities and police activities related to irregular migration.
The second part presents more in-depth
featured risk analyses of particular phenomena. As the current issue of the Western Balkans Quarterly is the third following
a new approach adopted for risk analysis quarterlies, the structure of the report
may still be subject to some readjustments.
Changes in data scope after Croatia’s
entry to the EU
Important changes in the collection and
use of data for Western Balkans Quarterly
were introduced upon Croatia’s joining the
EU in July 2013. Firstly, data for Slovenia,
which now has no external borders with
non-EU Western Balkan countries, has not
been included in the report since the third

quarter of 2013. Slovenian historical data
were also excluded from the tables in order to make the comparison with previous
quarters analytically meaningful.
Secondly, as the Croatian-Hungarian and
Croatian-Slovenian border sections have
now become internal EU-borders they are
no longer covered by this report.
Thirdly, after joining the EU, Croatian data
on illegal stay data are limited to detections at the border. More precisely, Croatia’s illegal stay data only include cases
detected on exit, while inland detections
are not included. The analysis of the illegal stay indicator takes this fact into
consideration.
Changes in data scope after Kosovo*’s
entry to the WB-RAN
Starting from the first quarter of 2014 data
from Kosovo* on key indicators of irregular migration will be included in the reporting, making it possible to get a more
comprehensive picture on the irregular
movements in the region. However, as
there is no historical data available for Kosovo*, the new data do in some measure
impact the comparisons of the examined
period with the previous quarters. When
necessary for analytical purposes, some
comparisons can be made also excluding
data from Kosovo* and noted in the text.

ported as ‘unknown’2 (41% of total nonregional flow).

Illegal border-crossings

Iraqi and Pakistani migrants ranked third
and fourth, respectively. The growing trend
in detections of these two nationalities
has been accelerating in recent quarters.
Compared with the previous period, detections of Iraqis have risen over threefold
and of Pakistanis – fivefold.

During the analysed period, over 610 000
illegal border-crossings by non-regional
migrants en route from Turkey, Greece and
Bulgaria were reported at the common
and regional borders (Fig. 2). This represents an eight-fold increase compared to
the previous quarter. Unsurprisingly, the
sheer volume of the flow (at some point
between 6 000 and 12 000 persons per
day) clearly overwhelmed border-control
authorities.

At the same time, less than 1% of the illegal
border-crossings in the Western Balkans
were associated with regional migrants.
Syrians and Afghans remained the two
main nationalities with a 39% and 11% share
of the non-regional flow, respectively. In
terms of absolute numbers, both nationalities registered high increases compared
with the previous quarter (almost eightand threefold rise, respectively). However,
their respective shares both decreased
in relation to the previous quarter due
to a very high number of migrants re-

southern common borders and then exit in its northern part with an apparent shift
towards the Croatian-Serbian border after the sealing of the Hungarian-Serbian
green border in mid-September

Together, these top four nationalities accounted for over 56% of the non-regional
migration flow between BCPs, while a
share of 41% was accounted by persons
reported as ‘unknown’.
The number of detections involving African migrants continued to increase, registering a 39% rise compared to the previous
quarter. All regions of Africa were represented in the total number, with Somalis,
Nigerians, Eritreans and Congolese featuring as the top reported nationalities
(accounting for 51% of African detections).

Detections of illegal border-crossing between BCPs by regional migrants

The Western Balkan regional migrants
demonstrated a 19% decrease in detections compared to the previous quarter,
mainly linked to a drop in the number of
detected Albanians and Kosovo* nationals and only represented less than 1% of
the overall flow affecting the region. This
fall comes somewhat unexpected (as the
third quarter typically brings a rise in the
number of regional migrants) and could
be due to the fact that many regional migrants manage to pass undetected taking
advantage of the massive transiting flow.
The vast majority of the Western Balkan
country nationals detected while attempting illegal border-crossing were reported,
at the Greek-Albanian border (69%) as part
of Albanian circular migration

The number of persons reported as unknown
is analysed as part of the non-regional
migration flow. The increase in detections
of non-regional migrants on the EasternAegean Islands coupled with the fact that
the majority of ‘unknowns’ were reported
at the Greek-FYR Macedonia border section
during Q3 justifies this approach.

Figure 4. In the southern part of the
region, the border between the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and
Greece remained the main entry point
for the non-regional transiting flow,
followed by the Bulgarian-Serbian
border, both registering high increases.
In the northern part, the HungarianSerbian green border remained the main
point of exit from the region; however,
after it was sealed in mid-September the
transit through the Croatian-Serbian
section significantly increased. The other
border sections were mostly affected by
low-level, mainly regional flows.

Facilitators
During the third quarter of 2015, the number of detected facilitators was 618, representing a minor 8% increase compared
with the previous three-month period.
This increase can be regarded marginal
if compared with the eightfold rise in the
number of reported illegal border-crossings by the non-regional migration flow.
This indicates that migrants are increasingly able to self-organise and/or rely on
authorities when it comes to travel arrangements for transiting the region
(Greece/FYR Macedonia/Serbia/Croatia/
Slovenia).

Source: WB-RAN and FRAN data as of 14 January 2016

As regards nationalities, 67% of all facilitators detected in the analysed quarter were
nationals of Western Balkan countries,
20% were citizens of the neighbouring
EU Member States and 11% were thirdcountry nationals from outside the region
or ‘unknown’. Serbia continued to report
the highest share of detections (55%), in
great majority involving Serbian nationals.

Importantly, a 70% increase in detected
facilitators compared with Q2 was reported at the Bulgarian-Serbian border
section. This is in line with the increasing
number of migrants targeting this section
but also with increased efforts by the Bulgarian authorities, which reported 250%
more facilitators compared to the previous quarter.

Situational
overview

Border checks
Clandestine entries
In Q3 2015, a total of 224 non-regional migrants were detected while attempting to
illegally cross the border hiding in vehicles.
This is a significantly lower number than
the peak observed in Q2 and also than the
total of Q3 2014. In terms of nationalities,
similar to the situation at the green border, Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis were the
top nationalities, together accounting for
96% of detections. Additionally, only 25 nationals of Western Balkan countries were
reported at BCPs.

Document fraud
During the third quarter, there were 216
cases of false document use reported by
the six Western Balkan countries, a number 8% lower than that of the previous
quarter.
Serbia continued to rank first, with 48%
of all regional detections, followed by the
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
and Albania, with 19% and 14% shares,
respectively.
In Q3 Albanians continued to rank first
amongst false document users, followed
by Kosovo* and Serbian citizens.
The most commonly used false documents were passports, ID cards and border

stamps. Unsurprisingly, the large majority
of ID cards (41 out of 43) were EU Member
States’ documents, as they can be used
to move freely inside the Schengen area
and the EU.
The majority (79) of false passports detected were reportedly issued by countries
from the region. Most of these documents
were Albanian (60), largely used by Albanian nationals (56) who attempted to avoid
entry bans imposed due to their misuse of
visa liberalisation.

Refusals of entry
In the analysed period, the number of refusals of entry increased by 38% compared
to the previous quarter: from roughly
9 800 to 13 600. This increase appears
to be largely corresponding to usual seasonal trends caused by high tourist mobility as compared to the corresponding
quarter of 2014, the number of issued refusals was stable. However, what stands
out is the higher number of refusals issued to Turkish nationals, which can be
also associated with the general trend of
workers returning to the EU after summer holiday period.

Most of the refusals reported by the neighbouring EU Member States were issued to
nationals of the Western Balkans, while in
the six countries of the region the largest
number of refused persons were nationals of EU Member States/Schengen Associated Countries followed by local residents
and Turkish nationals.
The third quarter is usually the period
when the highest number of refusals are
issued to Turkish nationals. This seasonal
phenomenon is mainly linked to Turkish
illegal workers who try to return to the
EU after spending their summer holiday
in Turkey. However, in Q3 2015 the number of refusals issued to Turks was 68%
higher than that of Q3 2014, possibly because more Turkish nationals try to take
advantage of the unprecedented migratory flow in order to get to the EU.
The overall number of refusals issued to
the non-regional nationalities associated
with the migratory flow originating from
Turkey/Greece continued to represent a
very low share of the total. This fact indicates that the non-regional transiting
flow directly targets green borders and
avoid BCPs.

As usual, a large majority of refusals of entry were issued at the land borders (90%),
while the remaining 10% were largely reported at the air borders.

Situation in the Western Balkans

Illegal stay in Western Balkan countries
There were 649 detections of illegal stay,
reported by the six Western Balkan countries during the period under review, which
represents a third consecutive quarterly
decrease of this indicator. The number is
significantly lower in relation to the previous quarter (-27%) and even more so when
compared with the corresponding period
of 2014 (-38%). This development can be
attributed to the recent acceleration of the
flow, as migrants are trying to transit the
Western Balkans as fast as possible in an
attempt to reach their destinations before
the various announced restrictions or border closures are put into effect.

Serbians continued to be mainly reported
by Bosnia and Herzegovina and, to a lesser
extent, by Montenegro, while the Albanians seemed to largely prefer staying in the
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
The nationals of Bosnia and Herzegovina
ranked third in detections of illegal stayers
during the third quarter and were mainly
reported by Serbia.

During the analysed quarter, Albanians
and Serbians ranked first and second, respectively, among detected illegal stayers.

Very few illegal stayers of nationalities associated with non-regional migration flow
originating from Turkey/Greece were de-

Syrians, who used to be in the top three
nationalities of illegal stayers in previous
quarters, practically disappeared during
the analysed period when only eight such
nationals were reported.

tected in the six Western Balkan countries. During the analysed quarter, there
were only roughly 130 such nationals reported, which represents the lowest number since data collection began.
The huge and growing discrepancy between the number of detected illegal border-crossings of the non-regional flow
originating from Greece/Turkey (over
380 000 reported by the six Western Balkan countries at and between BCPs) and
the discovered illegal stayers of the same
nationalities (roughly 130) indicates that
these persons mainly regard the Western
Balkans region as a transit area.

Figure 7. Only a small share of non-regional nationalities reported for illegal border-crossing are detected as illegal stayers

II. Featured risk analyses

Large and sustained transiting flow
through the Western Balkans strains
border capacities
The number of detected illegal bordercrossings by the non-regional transiting
flow throughout the analysed quarter was
unprecedented and beyond comparison
with any previous period. More exactly,
the quarterly total of 611 527 detected illegal border-crossings by non-regional migrants (611 303 between BCPs and 224 at
BCPs) was over two times higher than the
overall number of such detections registered since data collection began six and
a half years ago (i.e. 208 000 illegal border-crossings reported between January
2009 and June 2015).
The direct link between the non-regional
migration flow transiting the Western Balkans and the one affecting Greece’s borders
especially in the Eastern Aegean Sea was
also maintained during the third quarter.
Specifically, the pressure from the Aegean
Islands manifested itself on the Western
Balkan route with a certain time lag which
is basically the time migrants need to organise their onwards movements (Fig. 8).

observed in the Eastern Aegean is later
reflected in the Western Balkans

During the third quarter of 2015 the nonregional migration flow continued to enter
the Western Balkans across the southern
common borders with Greece and Bulgaria before heading north and leaving the
region, across the Hungarian-Serbian and,
starting from mid-September, across the
Croatian-Serbian border section.
The migratory flow increased dramatically
starting at the end of June, which can be
attributed to several factors such as the
amendments to the Asylum Law in the
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
(72-hour legal transit and access to public
transportation) or the publicised restrictive
measures prepared by the authorities of
affected countries. Namely, non-regional
migrants took advantage of the legal travel
facilities in the former Yugoslav Republic
of Macedonia and accelerated their transit in order to reach the most attractive
EU Member States/Schengen Associated
Countries in time before the Hungarian
or Croatian authorities toughened their
migration policies and imposed border
restrictions. Furthermore, migrants’ perceptions influenced by mixed media messages about destination countries also
played an important role in accelerating
and attracting the flow.
Along with the steep increase in the number of non-regional migrants the authorities of the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia and Serbia began having difficulties in handling the flow transiting
their countries. For example, 60% of the
migrants detected by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in Q3 were reported as ‘unknown’ nationality, indicating
that the authorities screening capacities
were stretched to the limit. At the same
time, Serbian statistics had to be revised,
as due to some confusions they did not in-

clude as illegal border-crossings between
BCPs those migrants who expressed the
intention to claim asylum upon detection
on the border and were allowed to travel
so that they could reach reception centre.
Throughout the analysed period, en masse
migration (groups of 500–1 000 people)
became common. People quickly realised
that authorities can be overwhelmed and
thus allow free entry to all. Subsequent attempts by some countries to reintroduce
a level of control (i.e. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia trying to seal
its border with Greece at the end of August) failed for the same reason.
In an attempt to relieve the high migratory pressure at their borders and within
their territories, the authorities of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and
also Serbia went from trying to prevent
migrants from entering to providing them
with organised onwards transportation.
This involved special trains and bus convoys. Consequently, these measures accelerated and the flow and transferred the
pressure along the route, towards the region’s northern common borders and further inside the EU.
After Hungary sealed off its green border
with Serbia in mid-September, the pressure at this section immediately eased
(from 9 000 detections on 15 September
to 410 on 16 September) and the numbers
continued to decrease reaching a daily average of below 182 detections in the last
ten days of September.
However, the flow was only diverted towards the Croatian-Serbian border while
still continuing to increase. As a result,
the Croatian-Serbian border section went
from reporting an average of 17 detections

wb-ran · q3 2015

per month between January and August to
being confronted with a daily average of
over 6 000 entries from Serbia between
the middle and the end of September (i.e.
over 90 800 detections between 16 and
30 September).
Similar to the situation at the border between Greece and the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia, once the non-regional flow started transiting the Croatian-Serbian section, the authorities faced
serious difficulties in screening and registering the migrants (i.e. >99% of the flow
was reported as ‘unknown nationality’).
Throughout the region, the main reported
migrants continued to be Syrians and Afghans but the very high inflow made it
impossible for the authorities to screen
all arrivals, thus leading to a massive increase in the number of migrants reported
with unknown nationality. More exactly,
during the analysed quarter roughly 41%
of the illegal-border crossings reported

to be the main points of entry to the
region. The Croatian-Serbian border
increases its importance as an exit point
after mid-September
Shares of the non-regional flow detected between
BCPs in Q2 and Q3 2015 by top border sections

at regional level involved migrants registered as unknown (during August and especially September).
Amongst the known nationalities, Syrians
and Afghans ranked top, followed by Iraqis
and Pakistanis. These four nationalities account for roughly 56% of the non-regional
flow, while as mentioned above, roughly
41% of the flow remains ‘unknown’. All of
the top five nationalities detected for illegal border-crossing between BCPs contributed to the sharp increase observed during
the analysed quarter (Fig. 10).

More detailed analyses aimed at revealing
some of the underlying reasons behind the
high number of detections involving Pakistani and Iraqi migrants are presented
in the following sections of the present
report.
Despite lower numbers compared to other
nationalities (8 742 illegal border-crossings
between BCPs), during the analysed period another increase can be observed in
detections of African migrants throughout the Western Balkans (+39% compared

Source: WB-RAN data as of 14 January 2016

to Q2 and the highest number since data
collection began).

The flow of Afghans towards the EU is likely to remain high
Media reports from the end of October 2015 suggest that every night roughly 60
buses travel from Kabul to Nimruz (the most common last departure place for
Afghan migrants who intend to travel via the land route across Iran and onwards).
Moreover, reports from the beginning of November 2015 tend to confirm
the information presented in the Western Balkans Q2 analysis according to
which Afghans living in Pakistan face serious risk of deportation. The Pakistani authorities declared they would be unwilling to extend the right to
stay for 1.5 million registered Afghans beyond December 2015. All these people will have to be returned within the next two years. Furthermore, the
unregistered Afghans living in Pakistan (estimated at one million) are even
more likely to be returned in line with the new policy of Pakistan.
The prospect of expulsion from Pakistan could encourage Afghans living
there to try moving to the EU.

II. Featured risk analyses

Main factors affecting irregular
migration from Pakistan appear to
be of economic nature
Between January and September 2015 on
the Eastern Mediterranean route there
were roughly 12 000 detected illegal border-crossings by Pakistani migrants, of
which roughly 7 000 only during the third
quarter. As a knock-on effect, roughly
25 000 illegal border-crossings between
BCPs by Pakistanis were registered on the
Western Balkan route in the framework
of the WB-RAN, of which almost 20 000
during Q3.

2013. Importantly, the same report indicates that, statistically, the security situations in all FATA regions has either already
improved or is improving, due to the various military operations conducted in these
regions. This is important as a number of
Pakistani migrants claim that they originate from these areas and that they were
forced to leave the country due to insecurity when detected at the EU’s external borders.

The 7 000 illegal-border crossings by Pakistani migrants on the Eastern Mediterranean route and 20 000 on the Western
Balkan route reported in the third quarter of 2015 represent new records for this
nationality.

Analysing the country’s situation from an
economic point of view may help provide
some more explanations regarding the increased migratory flow observed in the
recent period.

Migrants from Pakistan tend to transit Turkey before entering Greece and then the
Western Balkans. This is why it may seem
unusual that the number of illegal bordercrossings of this nationality is higher in the
Western Balkans than on the Eastern Aegean Islands. However, this difference could
be explained by the fact that the same migrant may be reported several times at different border sections while transiting the
Western Balkans region.
Judging by the information available in
open sources, Pakistan did not experience any developments that would justify a rise in the migration flow originating
from this country.
From a security point of view, the Austrian Fact Finding Mission Report of September 20153 indicates that the situation
in Pakistan, despite not being perfect, has
improved at national level compared with
3

FFM%20Report_2015_09.pdf

Pakistan saw two consecutive years of
growth in 2014 (4.03%) and 2015 (4.2%).
While the GDP growth rate is commendable given Pakistan’s past performance, it
is still far below the 5–7% required to absorb new entrants into the labour force
and to check rising unemployment.
However, if compared with the GDP
growth for the entire South Asian region
– of which Pakistan is the second largest
economy – Pakistan’s growth of almost
4% in the past five years remains below
its regional peers, which averaged almost
7%. Bangladesh has been growing at over
6% for the past few years while India, has
been able to maintain the average growth
of well over 5% over the past five years.
Inflation in Pakistan has fallen dramatically in the fiscal year 2014–15, with the
pace of decline quicker than that of some
regional peers. The decline is attributed to
cheaper oil prices that fell by almost 50%
in the same period.

According to the State Bank of Pakistan,
remittances 4 from overseas migrants
amounted to USD 18.4 billion in the fiscal year 2014–15, representing a 16% increase over the previous period. Inflows
from Saudi Arabia were the largest source
of remittances, followed by those from
the United Arab Emirates together accounting for USD 9.8 billion. Remittances
from other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
countries also amounted to USD 2.1 billion.
This means that the GCC accounts for a
65% share of the remittances Pakistan receives, while the rest is divided between
the UK and the United States (a 22.8%
share) and, to a lesser extent, Norway,
Switzerland, Australia and other countries (a 7% share).
According to existent statistics, remittances account for an increasing share of
Pakistan’s GDP (going from 5.7% in 2011
to almost 7% in 2015).5 Logically, the recent increase in remittances also contributed to the GDP growth registered in
2014 and 2015.
Despite this economic growth, a survey
conducted in 2014 by the Pakistani Statistics Bureau6, indicates that 37% of the
population perceived their economic situation as worse or much worse than in
the previous year, 40% did not notice any
change while only 20% perceived it as better or much better.

Moreover, according to a September 2014
study ‘Determinants of migration in Pakistan’, published in the Mediterranean Journal of Social Sciences7, 80% of the surveyed
persons declare low paying jobs as push
factors for migration and 70% see higher
salaries as pull factors.
The study also indicates that ‘the higher
rate of poverty reduction among the migrants’ families in the rural and urban areas of Pakistan, the greater chance will
be likely to the international migration’.
Judging by the above, the main push factors for migration originating from Pakistan are of economic nature, with the
Middle East remaining the main destination area. Despite economic growth
of Pakistan, the survey published by the
national statistical bureau indicates that
this growth went largely unnoticed as the
majority of the population (77%) assessed
their household economic situation as either unchanged or worse compared with
the previous year.

The recent increase in the amount of remittances received by Pakistan is likely to
encourage more economic migration. This
is supported by the findings of the mentioned study on determinants of migration
in Pakistan, which indicates that the better migrants are able to reduce the poverty of their families through the money
they send home, the more attractive migration seems to others.
In the same line of thinking, considering
the fact that most Pakistani consider low
income as the most important reason to
migrate and their economic situation as
either unchanged or deteriorated in relation to previous periods, it is likely that
more Pakistanis will seek employment
abroad in the future.
Judging by the size of remittances, the oilrich Middle Eastern Countries remain the
first choice for Pakistani economic migrants for the time being. However, the
fact that a considerable amount of remittances also originates from EU Member

States/Schengen Associated Countries, especially the UK, Norway and Switzerland
also highlights these countries as important destinations.
With this in mind, it is logical to assume
that a slow-down of infrastructure spending by GCC countries (likely if the oil prices
remain low for a longer period) would negatively impact Pakistani employees and
consequently reduce the flow of remittances from this part of the world. In the
same context, if remittances originating
from EU Member States/Schengen Associated Countries remain at the same level
or continue to increase, more Pakistani
economic migrants may opt for European
countries as their final destinations.
A better implementation of the EU-Pakistan readmission agreement discussed
in October8 could help reduce the attractiveness of the EU for economic migrants
from the south-east Asian country.

II. Featured risk analyses

Iraqi migrant flow towards Europe
and the influence of the Syrian crisis
Increased propensity of
Iraqis to leave their country
According to open-source information,
living standards in Iraqi Kurdistan have
rapidly deteriorated as politicians haggle over power. Basic services and essentials, including electricity, cooking gas and
water, are not guaranteed and corruption
permeates the quasi-institutions of the
Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG)
and society at large.
Furthermore, the security situation in Iraq
also plays an important role in the people’s decision to migrate. According to the
Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre
(IDMC), there were at least 4 million internally displaced persons in Iraq as of 15
June 2015, which can also be regarded as
a push factor.
Apparently, the growing proportion of
population of Iraqi Kurdistan is frustrated
by the recent developments and likely to
leave the country. There are no precise
figures but the United Nations estimates
that more than 50 000 people left Iraq
over the summer of 2015.
Moreover, during September and October Iraqi authorities were also confronted
with an unusually high demand for new
passports (roughly 13 000 applications per
day), while flights from Baghdad to Turkey were booked for months in advance.
These developments tend to point towards
an increased propensity of Iraqis to leave
their country.

Main modus operandi and routes
Information obtained during debriefing
activities indicates that Iraqi migrants

14 of 23

manage to obtain Turkish visas without
difficulty and then travel legally to Turkey, even flying from Baghdad to Istanbul.
Older information also indicates that Iraqi
migrants who choose to illegally cross into
Turkey employ locals familiar with the terrain to guide them across the land border
in the area of Zakho/Silopi.
Moreover, despite the fact that Iraqis need
a visa to enter Turkey, in 2014 there were
almost twice as many regular passengers
reported at Şırnak-Habur, the main BCP of
Turkey with Iraq (3.74 million), as those at
the main BCP with Greece (1.98 million).
Furthermore, in terms of the entry/exit
ratio of Iraqis, which could be indicative
of the risk of overstaying or transit, there
were 61 000 more entries to Turkey during 2014. Considering this, the visa obligation is not a major obstacle for Iraqis
to enter Turkey when they need to. Likewise, the entry/exit ratio suggests that
Turkey is treated as a transit country on
route to Greece.
Public transport is used to travel across
Turkey, with Istanbul and Izmir being the
main hubs where deals with facilitators
for the onwards journey to Europe are
made. Generally, the cost of crossing the
Aegean Sea to the Greek islands is around
EUR 1 500, while the facilitators who guide
people across Turkey’s land borders to Bulgaria charge around EUR 1 000.

Iraqi migration: the impact of
the Syrian crisis, geography
and perceptions
Between January and September 2015,
roughly 306 000 Syrians (227 000 in Q3)
and about 23 300 Iraqis (roughly 19 000
in Q3) were reported in the Eastern Mediterranean sea and land routes.

As a knock-on effect, roughly 280 000 illegal border-crossings between BCPs by
Syrians (236 500 in Q3) and 29 000 by Iraqis (21 200 in Q3) were registered on the
Western Balkan route reported in the context of the WB-RAN.
Given the geographical proximity of these
two countries of origin to the Eastern
part of the EU and the Western Balkans,
it is somewhat natural that the highest
number of detected Syrian and Iraqi migrants are reported on the two mentioned
routes.
Syria and Iraq are neighbouring countries,
both also share a border with Turkey. The
ethnic and linguistic composition of their
populations (mainly Arabic and Kurdish) is
also very similar. Therefore, it is hardly surprising that the Iraqi and Syrian migrants
use similar routes and modi operandi. The
two nationalities tend to transit Turkey,
reach the external borders of Greece and
then move via the Western Balkans to
reach their final destinations in the more
developed EU Member States/Schengen
Associated Countries.
Perceptions generally play an important
role in migration decisions. One of such
perceptions is that Syrian nationals are offered better prospects of moving and receiving international protection in the EU.
For example, ever since 2014 Syrian nationals have not been kept in closed reception
centres after being apprehended in Greece,
and they are currently allowed to leave the
Eastern Aegean Islands aboard ferries in
order to go and register their asylum request in Athens.
Due to these perceived advantages, other
nationals may falsely claim to be Syrian
(the so-called nationality swapping) and

wb-ran · q3 2015

sometimes even obtain fraudulent Syrian
documents (a phenomenon revealed during debriefing interviews conducted in the
Eastern Aegean and also further along the
route, in Hungary).
This perception, along with the geographical proximity, the ethnic, cultural and linguistic similarities of Iraq and Syria, may
have encouraged many Iraqis to falsely
claim Syrian nationality and enter the EU,
often successfully. Thus the real number
of Iraqis who have already reached the

EU could in fact be higher than the official statistics show.
The trend of Iraqis detected for illegal border-crossing on the Eastern Mediterranean
route has been sharply rising throughout
2015 with the third quarter showing the
highest value since data collection began
(Fig. 11). This may confirm open-source reports of high numbers of people leaving
Iraq heading for Europe.

Eastern Aegean routes were the most
transited by Iraqi migrants on their way
to the EU

illegally between BCPs on their way to the EU in Q3
2014–Q3 2015, by main routes

Iraqi security forces leaving for Europe
Some Iraqi soldiers are abandoning their posts and joining a wave of civilian migrants headed for Europe, raising new doubts about the cohesion of
the country’s Western-backed security forces in the fight against ISIL/Da’ish
militants. Interviews with migrants and an analysis of social media activity
suggest that scores of servicemen of the national army, police and special
forces, as well as Shiite militias and Kurdish peshmerga, have defected in
recent months or plan to leave soon.
