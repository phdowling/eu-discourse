Frontex official publications fall into four main categories: risk analysis, training,
operations and research, each marked with a distinct graphic identifier. Risk analysis
publications bear a triangular symbol formed by an arrow drawing a triangle, with a
dot at the centre. Metaphorically, the arrow represents the cyclical nature of risk
analysis processes and its orientation towards an appropriate operational response.
The triangle is a symbol of ideal proportions and knowledge, reflecting the pursuit
of factual exactness, truth and exhaustive analysis. The dot at the centre represents
the intelligence factor and the focal point where information from diverse sources
converges to be processed, systematised and shared as analytical products. Thus,
Frontex risk analysis is meant to be at the centre and to form a reliable basis for its
operational activities.

Introduction
FRAN Quarterly reports are prepared by
the Frontex Risk Analysis Unit and provide
a regular overview of irregular migration
at the EU external borders, based on the
irregular migration data exchanged among
Member State border-control authorities
within the cooperative framework of the
Frontex Risk Analysis Network (FRAN)
and its subsidiary, the European Union
Document-Fraud Risk Analysis Network
(EDF-RAN).
The main purpose of the FRAN Quarterlies is to provide:
1.	feedback to the FRAN community in
the context of information exchange;
2.	a periodic update to the situational picture of irregular migration at EU level;
and
3.	material for constructive discussion on
reporting protocols and related trends
and patterns.
This report is intended to simultaneously
serve two objectives: first – to provide a
clear summary of the situation at the external border of the EU, and second – to
serve as an archive for future reference
and comparative analyses.
Harmonising complex, multi-source migration data among Frontex and Member
States is an ongoing process. Therefore,

some of the more detailed data and trends
in this report should be interpreted with
caution and, where possible, cross-referenced with information from other
sources. The statistics should be understood in the context of the different levels of passenger flows passing through
different border sections, the activities
of Member State border-control authorities undertaken to secure different border sections and widespread variation in
reporting and data-collection practices.
FRAN members and Member State risk
analysis experts and border-control authorities are considered the primary customers of these reports. In addition to
the discussions taking place during FRAN
meetings, Member State experts are invited and actively encouraged to examine
and comment upon the data and analyses
presented here. Despite all efforts of the
Frontex Risk Analysis Unit and Member
State experts involved in data exchange
and analyses, it is conceivable that minor
errors will occur in these reports due to
very challenging timelines and the growing volume and complexity of the data and
other information exchanged within the
FRAN community.
Starting with the 2015 Q1 issue, the Frontex Risk Analysis Unit has implemented a

number of changes to present the analysis of migration related indicators in the
FRAN Quarterly in a more concise and focused way.
The first part provides a situational overview, broken down by main areas of work
of border-control authorities and police
activities related to irregular migration.
n	
Surveillance, describing and analysing
trends in detections of illegal bordercrossing between BCPs;
n	
Border checks, describing detections
reported during checks at BCPs (people hiding in vehicles or refused entry);
n	
Fraudulent documents, describing trends
and pattern related to document fraud
both at the border and within the EU;
n	
Situation in the EU, examining developments related to persons applying
for asylum and those detected staying illegally, facilitators, return decisions and effective returns.
The second thematic part of the report
consists of several featured risk analyses,
examining trends and patterns of irregular
migration in a more comprehensive manner. Eventually it is expected that some of
the featured analysis topics would be developed by external contributors (FRAN
members, EU agencies and international
institutions).

Methodology

The current 31st issue of the FRAN Quarterly is a comparative analysis of FRAN
data collected between January and March
2016 and exchanged between 31 Member
State border-control authorities within
the framework of the Frontex Risk Analysis Network (FRAN). The report presents
the results of statistical analysis of quarterly changes of eight irregular-migration indicators and one asylum indicator,
aggregated at the level of the event. Bimonthly analytical reports exchanged by
Member States were also used for interpretative purposes and to provide qualitative information, as were other available
sources of information, such as Frontex
Joint Operations.
Precise definitions of Indicators 1 to 6,
aimed at harmonising the data exchanged
at EU level, were presented in the annexes
of the Q1 and Q2 reports in 2009 and so
are not repeated here.
The FRAN data exchange has been in
place since September 2008. Data are

4 of 33

exchanged through the ICONet Internet
platform, an interest group of the European Commission’s CIRCA server. Member
State monthly data are based on a country template prepared by the Frontex Risk
Analysis Unit. The deadline for submitting
data for each month was the 20th day of
the subsequent month, with the exception of the end-of-year data, which are requested by 15 January each year. For this
31st issue of the FRAN Quarterly, the target
for Member States to upload the monthly
data was thus 20 April 2016. In principle,
data submitted subsequent to this date
will be reflected in the next FRAN Quarterly, except in cases where clarification
is needed in order to proceed with comprehensive analysis.
In January 2012, the European Union Document-Fraud Risk Analysis Network (EDFRAN) was formed as a specialist forum to
oversee the exchange and analyses of detections of document fraud at the external borders and on all international flights.
The data were backdated and merged with

those exchanged under a pilot Tailored Risk
Analysis released in 2011.1
At the beginning of 2014, Member States
started to regularly collect quantitative
information on indicators related to secondary movements. In addition, Frontex
organised workshops for Member State
experts to gather their expertise and analyse available data. Their input was essential for the analysis of intra-EU/Schengen
secondary movements of undocumented
migrants.
External borders refer to the borders between Member States and third countries.
The borders between Schengen Associated
Countries (Liechtenstein, Norway, Iceland
and Switzerland) and third countries are
also considered as external borders. The
borders between Schengen Associated
Countries and Schengen Member States
1

The Nature and Extent of Document Fraud

Ref. R063/2011

fran · q1 2016

are considered as internal borders. For the
indicators on detections of facilitators, illegal stay and asylum, statistics are also reported for detections at the land borders
between Schengen Member States and
Schengen candidates (Bulgaria, Croatia,
Cyprus and Romania) or non-Schengen
Member States (the UK and Ireland), so
that a total for Member States and Schengen Associated Countries as a whole can
be presented. It was not possible to make
this distinction for air and sea borders because Member States do not habitually
differentiate between extra-EU and intra-EU air and sea connections but tend
to aggregate data for all arrivals.
When data are examined at the level of
third-country nationalities, a large percentage usually falls under categories of

‘Other (not specified)’ or ‘Unknown’. It is
expected that the percentage reported
under these categories will decrease
with time as Member States improve
the quality and speed of their identification, data collection and reporting practices: nationalities are often reported
as ‘Unknown’ if an individual’s nationality cannot be established before reports
are submitted.
This issue of the FRAN Quarterly also includes the main findings of Frontex-coordinated Joint Operations active for at least
a proportion of Q1 2016.
Both primary data sources, such as interviews with irregular migrants, and secondary data sources, such as reports of
intelligence analysts, were used to pro-

vide an exhaustive overview of the situation at the external borders of the EU.
Additionally, open-source data were researched as background information for
the present analysis.

Acknowledgements
The Frontex Risk Analysis Unit would like
to express its gratitude to all FRAN and
EDF-RAN members and their associates
in Member State statistical, migration
and document-fraud units who collect,
aggregate and exchange monthly data,
also to the analysts who compile the bimonthly analytical reports, on which much
of the detailed analyses presented here
are based.

After the FRAN indicators of illegal border-crossing between BCPs, illegal stay,
and asylum had reached record levels in
the fourth quarter of 2015, the situation
clearly relaxed at the beginning of 2016. On
one hand, the irregular migration pressure
continuously decreased between January
and March 2016. On the other hand, the
reporting period still showed the highest
level of irregular migration of any previous first quarter since the FRAN data collection began.
Similar to 2015, also in Q1 2016, most migrants were detected on the Eastern Mediterranean and Western Balkan routes.
Most migrants who had entered the EU
from Turkey were reported for a second
time when they passed through the Western Balkans and then crossed the EU’s external border from Serbia.
In Q1 2016, illegal border-crossings detected
at the EU’s external borders with Turkey fell
behind the record levels of the second half
of 2015 for several reasons. Firstly, the adverse weather conditions prevented many
migrants from boarding boats in the Eastern Aegean Sea. Secondly, the agreement
between the EU and Turkey removing incentives to seek irregular routes to Greece
and targeting the people smugglers’ business model led to a further reduction of
arrivals on the Eastern Aegean islands in
March. Nevertheless, the number of illegal
border-crossings on this route remained
higher than in any previous first quarter.
Irregular migration on the Western Balkan
route has closely followed the developments in the Eastern Mediterranean route
with the difference that irregular migration

pressure declined faster than in the Eastern
Aegean Sea. Consolidated border control
measures and increasing entry restrictions
coordinated by the authorities along the
route nearly stopped migration and left
many migrants stranded on their way, especially in the Greek area of Idomeni. Existing data indicate that most migrants on
this route were non-regional nationals.
The level of migratory flows across the
Central Mediterranean Sea was also higher
than during any other first quarter since
the FRAN data collection began in 2007.
Compared with last quarter, however,
the number of illegal border-crossings reported by Italy and Malta decreased due to
adverse weather conditions at sea. Three
quarters of the detections made on the
Central Mediterranean route in Q1 2016
were related to migrants from West Africa.
In the reference period, detections of illegal
stay in the EU/Schengen Associated Countries were over one third lower than during
the last quarter, at the peak of last year’s
record migration to the EU. However, with
more than 127 000 persons reported in
the EU/Schengen area, the number is 19%
higher than during the same period of 2015.
Compared with one year ago, the relative
increase in Iraqi and Iranian nationals detected for illegal stay was significant.
In spite of the unprecedented level of irregular migration, the number of effective
returns decreased 3% since last quarter.
Fewer effective returns were reported especially of citizens of Western Balkan and
Latin American countries.

FRAN data for the period between January
and March 2016 show a 370% increase in
overall detections of illegal border-crossing compared to the same period of 2015.
With 284 525 detections in Q1 2016, Member States reported the highest number
of illegal border-crossings of any previous first quarter since FRAN data collection began in 2007. On the other hand, the
level of irregular migration in Q1 2016 has

tion pressure was still on a very high level
by the end of March 2016.

Migration pressure on the Eastern
Mediterranean route decreases

Influx of migrants leads to intensified
secondary movements

Also in the Eastern Aegean Sea, the level of
irregular migration has been significantly
lower than during the last quarter, but still
on a record level for this time of the year.
With more than 150 000 illegal bordercrossings reported, the Eastern Mediterranean route has been the entry point to
the EU with the largest migration pressure.
Most irregular migrants were detected on
boats entering the Eastern Aegean sea or
already on one of the Greek islands, such
as Lesbos, Chios and Samos. Although the
number of detections has been steadily
decreasing after October 2015, the migra-

Many irregular migrants who had arrived in
Greece or Bulgaria continued their journey
across the Western Balkan countries towards Western and Northern Europe. With
almost 110 000 illegal border-crossings, the
number of detections in Q1 2016 amounted
to less than a fourth of what was reported
in Q4 2015. Due to increasingly restrictive
measures put in place by the authorities on
the Western Balkan route, the number of detections has also been decreasing within the
first quarter of 2016: While in January, the
number of illegal border-crossings has been
on the highest level (67 000) of any previ-

8 of 33

Around 49% of the irregular migrants
claimed to be of Syrian nationality, compared to 59% one year ago. While the share
of Afghans continued to amount to one
quarter of the total migration flow, the proportion of Iraqi nationals compared with
one year ago has tripled to 15%. Notably,
also the number of migrants who claimed
to be from Pakistan and Iran have increased
since Q1 2015, although on a low level.

ous January since the FRAN data collection
began in 2007, in March, the number of detections have decreased to around 5 000, a
lower level than in March 2015.
Until February, most attempted illegal entries from the Western Balkan countries to
the EU were reported from Croatia’s border with Serbia. Since March, however, with
increasing restrictions imposed by authorities along the Western Balkan route, irregular migration via Croatia and Slovenia has
effectively stopped. At the same time, the
number of migrants breaking through the
fence from Serbia to Hungary has reached
a significant level again for the first time
since the barrier was completed on 16 October 2015. In March 2016, Hungary reported an average of around 100 illegal
border-crossings per day.
In contrast to one year ago, the share of
migrants from Kosovo* and other Western
Balkan countries has shrunk to far below 1%
of the irregular migration flow on this route.
In the first quarter of 2016, the nationality
of migrants on the Western Balkan route
could not be ascertained in all cases. However, the available information and the data
on arrivals on the Greek islands show that
a majority of the migrants were of Syrian

and, to a lesser extent, of Afghan nationality. Interestingly, also a significant number
of Moroccan and Algerian nationals made
their way to the EU via the detour through
the Western Balkan countries.
Irregular migration in the Central
Mediterranean high in spite of the
winter season
In Q1 2016, the level of migratory flows
across the Central Mediterranean Sea has
been higher than during any first quarter
since the FRAN data collection began in
2007. Compared to the previous quarter,
the number of illegal border-crossings reported by Italy and Malta have decreased
by 14%, but on the other hand the number
of detections were 83% higher than one
year ago. Of the 18 776 detections, almost
10 000 were reported in March alone.
Three quarters of the detections made on
the Central Mediterranean route were related to migrants from West Africa. Nigerians showed to be the fastest growing
nationality: While one year ago, nine percent of all reported irregular migrants on
this route were Nigerians, their share grew
to 18 % during the reporting period.

94% of the migrants departed from Libya,
where the continued absence of an effective national government allowed criminal
facilitation networks to thrive. Detections
were made almost exclusively as part of
Search and Rescue operations following
satellite phones calls mainly made from migrant boats. While departures from Egypt
increased but remained on a low level, the
closure of the borders along the Western
Balkan route did not lead to a large increase
in detections of migrant boats trying to
reach Italy from Greece.
Detections of irregular migration to
Spain higher than one year ago
Although irregular migration on the Western Mediterranean route has generally
been on a low level compared with other
routes, Spain reported increases in detections of irregular migrants this winter. In
Q1 2016, more than 1 400 migrants tried
to reach the EU on the Western Mediterranean route, slightly more than one
half of the number of last quarter but 43%
more than in the same period of last year.
The migration pressure is mainly caused
by West African migrants trying to reach
the Spanish coast on boats. Only six percent of the overall detections on this route

during the reference period were related
to Northern African nationals, mainly from
Morocco. In spite of the detrimental sea
conditions due to the winter season, at the
land border to the Spanish towns of Ceuta
and Melilla, only a comparably low number of around 10o illegal border-crossings
was registered during the reference period.
Increased detections at the EU’s eastern border
In Q1 2016, detections of illegal bordercrossing at the eastern borders amounted
to 213 detections. With the Vietnamese nationals representing the largest group of
migrants, Turkish irregular migrants have
become the second-ranking nationality on
this route for the first time, while in previous quarters, only singular cases of Turkish
nationals illegally crossing the Eastern borders were reported. Irregular migration on
this route however appears in more ways
than just through illegal border-crossings,
including through increased numbers of
refusals of entry, detections of document
fraud or abuse of the right for asylum (see
section Border Checks overleaf).

Strongest increase in refusals of
entry related to Moroccan nationals
In Q1 2016, 30 253 refusals of entry were issued at the EU external borders, which is only
slightly above the quarterly average reported
to the FRAN since 2007. Like in all previous
quarters since Q3 2013, Ukrainians, with 6 555
issued refusals, were the most reported nationality again. Albanian nationals, with 3 615
refusals, ranked second for the sixth quarter
in a row. 79% of the reported Ukrainians were
refused at the Polish border, while around one
third of the reported Albanian citizens were
refused by Italy. In most cases Ukrainians
were not let into the EU because they could
not present appropriate documentation justifying the purpose and conditions of stay. Notably, the majority of Albanian nationals was
refused because of an alert existing in the SIS
or a national register.
Citizens of Moldova have progressively been
subject to more refusals since last summer,
especially issued by Italy, Poland and Romania. The number of issued refusals to citizens of this country has thus been on the
highest level since 2008. During the reporting period, Tajik citizens have been issued the largest numbers of refusals since
FRAN data collection began (321), almost
all at the Polish land border.

Also the number of refusals issued to Moroccan nationals has grown strongly, from 1 090
in the last quarter to 1 755 during the reporting
period. Most Moroccans were reported from
the Spanish land and sea borders.
At air borders, the 878 refusals issued to
citizens of Brazil have been on the highest
level since 2012. Most were issued by Portugal, Spain and Ireland and because of not
appropriate documentation justifying the
purpose and conditions of stay (280 of all
Brazilians refused).
Hungary reports fastest growth in
clandestine migrants
The decision of authorities along the
Western Balkan route to stop the transit of irregular migrants and to demand
valid travel documents to pass the borders should in principle increase the risk
of irregular migrants entering the EU hidden in lorries and other vehicles. However,
the actual number of detections of clandestine entry decreased by almost one
half compared to one year ago and 16%
compared to last quarter. 586 persons attempted to cross the EU’s external borders
hiding in vehicles between January and
March. Again, most clandestine entry attempts were reported in South-East Eu-

rope, mainly attempting to enter the EU
from Turkey to Bulgaria.
But unlike in previous quarters, Hungary
has during this reference period reported
the second highest number of this indicator.
As Croatia has closed its border to Serbia
for irregular migration in line with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Serbia, and Slovenia, some of those migrants
who intended to reach the Schengen area
opted to enter Hungary clandestinely, often assisted by facilitation networks. All
clandestine entries reported by Hungary
were detected at the border with Serbia.
The profile of the clandestine migrants detected by Hungary is however particular:
Half of them were Moroccan nationals, one
third from Algeria. Between Hungarian border crossing points, these two nationalities
represented only 9% and less than 1%, respectively, of the total illegal border-crossings during the first quarter of 2016.
Many detections of illegal stay on
exit related to asylum seekers
During the reporting period, more than
19 000 persons were detected on exit from
the EU or Schengen area without valid documents proving their permission to stay. The
number of detections was 6% lower than in

the previous quarter, during which this indicator showed its record since FRAN data
collection began. On the other hand, during the same period of last year, the number
was 12 705, being around half lower than the
current level. The FRAN data collection does
not cover the reason for illegal stay, so the
cases of illegal stay detected on exit include
migrants who had either crossed the border
to the EU/Schengen Associated Countries illegally, abused legal channels, or initially entered the EU/Schengen Associated Countries
legally but no longer fulfilled the conditions
of stay or residence.
The reported numbers also reflect the extent
to which border guard authorities in different
Member State check documents of passengers when leaving the EU/Schengen Associated Countries. To ensure, among other
issues, the systematic and reliable identification of overstayers at Schengen area’s external borders, the European Commission, in
April 2016, presented a revised proposal for a
Regulation for the establishment of a common ‘Entry/Exit System’ (EES).2
The most significant development in detections of illegal stay on exit was reported
by Germany. The Member State has not
2

COM(2016) 196 final

only been reporting the highest number of this indicator since Q3 2011, it has
also been showing a strong upward trend
since the beginning of last year. While Germany reported more than 3 000 persons
who attempted to leave the EU/Schengen area through the air border in Q1 2015,
this number has more than doubled one
year later.
According to German FRAN data, the majority of the nationalities detected for illegal stay on exit were also among the
top-ranking nationalities having applied
for asylum during the migratory crisis year
of 2015. The three highest-ranking nationalities reported for illegal stay on exit,
Turkish, Kosovo* citizens, and Albanians,
have submitted 21% of the asylum applications in 2015. Many of the detections of

illegal stay on exit seem to be related to
asylum seekers individually returning to
their home countries (e.g. see graphs on
Kosovo* and Iraqi citizens below).
All over the EU and Schengen area, the
highest-ranking nationality detected for
illegal stay on exit were still Ukrainians, although their number has strongly dropped
from the peak of 4 132 in Q4 2015 to 2 681
during the reporting period. Most of these
Ukrainian citizens were reported from the
external land BCPs in Poland. The strongest increase of a single nationality in detections of illegal stay on exit at the external
land borders was reported from Hungary,
where the number of detected Russian
nationals has grown from 0 in Q4 2015 to
almost 200 during the reference period.

Fewer document fraud detections on
intra-EU/Schengen movements
In Q1 2016, the overall number of document
fraud incidents reported in the EDF-RAN
was 17% lower than last quarter, reaching
5 143 cases, involving 5 815 detected fraudulent documents at BCPs. Member States
have been reporting lower numbers in document fraud since last September, when
the migration pressure in the Mediterranean Sea began to exponentially increase.
The opened borders and government-organised transport of irregular migrants
along the Western Balkan route have reduced their demand to reach the desired
EU destination countries with the help of
fraudulent documents.
This development, among others, has led
to fewer detections of document fraud
along the main intra-Schengen routes.
With almost 250 detections, the number
of persons aiming to reach other Schengen countries from Greece with fraudulent documents was more than 39% lower
than one year ago. Only around 60 document fraudsters were for example detected on flights from Greece to Germany,

12 of 33

63% less than in Q1 2015. Also from Italy,
the number of passengers willing to board
intra-Schengen flights with fraudulent
documents was 37% lower.
In the cases of both mentioned embarkation countries, Greece and Italy, the decrease in detections was to a large extent
caused by fewer Syrian nationals trying to
reach destinations such as Germany, Switzerland or Denmark. Back in Q1 2015, 317
fraudulent documents were seized from
Syrian citizens on intra-Schengen flights
from Greece and Italy, mostly with counterfeited Greek ID cards and forged passports. During the reporting period, these
numbers decreased to only 11. As in the
first quarter of 2016 most countries on the
Western Balkan route have allowed Syrians to transit their territories, the main
reason to use fraudulent documents has
been to avoid the exhausting overland trip.

mained stable compared to Q4 2015. The
strongest increase, of 141% between the
first quarter of 2015 and 2016 was related
to persons travelling from Ukraine, either across the land borders or by plane.
Of the 407 fraudulent travel documents
that were seized on entry from Ukraine,
205 were from citizens of this country who
obtained their EU visas in a fraudulent way.
For the first time, also a larger number of
Turkish citizens has tried to reach Poland
from Ukraine by presenting fraudulent
documents. Poland has seized almost 60
false, mainly German visas, from Turkish
citizens in Q1 2016.

More Ukrainians with fraudulent
documents at the external borders

In a longer perspective, document fraud
detections at the EU/Schengen Associated
Country external borders have been steadily decreasing since 2014, when Member
States reported clearly more than 2 000
detections per quarter. A closer look reveals that this negative trend was not
equally reported from all but only on specific incoming routes.

With 1 842 detected cases of document
fraud on arrival in the EU/Schengen area
from third countries, this indicator has re-

On flights from Nigeria, the number of
document fraud detections has been decreasing from 272 one year ago to 37 in
the reporting period. This reduction in detections was foremost caused by the suspension of flights from Lagos to Rome in
March 2015. Also on flights from Morocco
and at the Spanish land borders with Morocco, the number of cases of document
fraud decreased from 390 one year ago to
293 during the reporting period.

the previous quarter. The comparison with
previous years shows that document fraud
related to the most reported nationalities
on the routes from the Schengen area to
the Common Travel Area (CTA) were subject to seasonal changes. Detections of
Albanian citizens, who are the nationality most reported for the use of fraudulent travel documents (mostly false Italian,
Romanian and Greek ID cards) on the way
to the CTA, used to peak during the fourth
quarters of each year of the EDF data collection. This is in line with the generic
asylum curve of Western Balkan citizens
in the EU, which is usually highest during
the cold winter months. Hence the decrease during the first quarter does not
necessarily reflect a lasting downward
trend of Albanian citizens using fraudulent documents.

winter, the number of Syrians continuing
their journey to the EU non-Schengen
countries (especially the UK) with fraudulent documents has decreased by 63% from
266 in Q4 2015 to 99 detections in Q1 2016.
The number of Iranians reported by the
Member States for document fraud has
in effect remained on the high level of the
previous quarter. The increase in document
fraud detections related to Iranians that
has been visible since the FRAN data collection began in 2009, has accelerated in
the third quarter of 2015. Almost 41% of the
fraudulent travel documents used by Iranian citizens were seized on routes from
the Schengen area to the UK, another 17%
on intra-Schengen routes. Most cases on
these routes were related to forged Greek
and Bulgarian passports or counterfeited
Romanian and Greek ID cards.

Also nationalities related to the large migration flows along the Mediterranean
routes were visible in the EDF data of persons detected for document fraud between Schengen and EU non-Schengen
countries. For example Syrian citizens:

In Q1 2016, detections of illegal stay were 35%
lower than during the last quarter, at the
peak of last year’s record migration to the
EU. However, with more than 127 000 persons reported in the EU/Schengen area, the
number is 19% higher than during the same
period of 2015. This is the highest number of
detections of illegal stay of any first quarter
since FRAN data collection began in 2007.
As in 2015, the majority of detections were
related to the large flow of migrants who
arrived in the EU first from Turkey, transited
the Western Balkans, and continued their
journey on secondary routes through the
Schengen area towards their desired destination. However, the share of detections
reported by Germany has decreased from
around 40% of the total in Q3 and Q4 2015 to
around 30% in Q1 2016. During the reporting
period, Germany, France, and Austria were
the top countries for detections of illegal
stay, reporting more than 61% of the total
EU/Schengen Associated Countries number.
After Syrians have undoubtedly been the nationality with the largest number of detections of illegal stay during the last summer,
it is now the Afghans that are highest-ranking in this regard. More than 16 000 persons

14 of 33

or 13% of all nationalities detected for illegal stay in Q1 2016 were Afghans (Syrians:
14 008). With almost 13 049 detections, Iraqi
nationals have been the third largest group
among those who were detected as illegal
stayers during the reporting period.
The most remarkable hike in detections of
illegal stay was reported in relation to Iranian citizens: Member States registered a
more than five-fold increase of this nationality compared to one year ago, to 7 290
detections during the reporting period. The
number was on the highest level of any first
quarter since FRAN data collection began
and extraordinary considering the fact that
detections of Iranian illegal stayers have
never been seen above the level of 5 500
before the second half of 2015. Almost one
third of this number was registered by Germany in Q1 2016, with a majority of detections reported from its airports. Recently also
Belgium has reported an increase in detections of illegal stay related to this nationality.
Asylum applications on a record level
In Q1 2016, Member States reported slightly
more than 274 000 asylum applications,
which is the highest number of any previ-

ous first quarter since FRAN data collection began in 2007, but only 66% of what
was reported in Q4 2015. The vast majority of Member States reported decreases in
asylum applications compared to the last
quarter, and some major asylum destinations such as Sweden, Switzerland and the
UK also within the quarter.
Due to re-established controls at the internal borders and the introduction of the
carrier’s obligation to check the passenger’s
travel documents, Sweden for example reported only one tenth of the 87 000 asylum applications of Q4 2015. In Hungary, by
contrast, the number of asylum applications was five times as high as in Q4 2015.
This growth was possibly caused by more
migrants who broke through the fence at
the border with Serbia.
Germany registered the highest number
of asylum cases since FRAN data collection began and a further 13% increase compared to the last quarter. This growth was
however mainly due to a backlog caused
by the large number of asylum seekers
who arrived in the EU during the migration peak of 2015. Due to this backlog, the reported EU asylum applications

did not immediately follow the rise of irregular migration to the EU in the second half 2015. In the first quarter of 2016,
the situation turned around: Although the
migration pressure on the Eastern Mediterranean route decreased, the asylum numbers especially in Germany remained on an
unprecedented level, as the asylum authorities partly processed those cases of 2015.
Replacing in the EU-wide FRAN data the
German asylum application figures with
the number of deposited intentions to apply for asylum in Germany (according to
the ‘EASY’ system), shows that the asylum
situation has indeed calmed down and is
more or less in line with the current pressure on the external borders.
EU-wide, Syrians were again the top-ranking asylum nationality in the EU/Schengen
area with more than 100 000 applications
in the reporting period, which is more than
three times as many as in Q1 2015. Both
Moldovan and Moroccan asylum applications reached their highest level since
FRAN data collection began. While 97%
of all Moldovan applications were submitted in Germany in Q1 2016, Hungary
has been reported increasing detections

69 392

(63 212)

46 996

(37 562)

of illegal stay of Moldovan citizens already
since the beginning of 2015, reaching a
peak in Q4 2015.
In Q1 2016, Hungary was also the Member
State reporting the highest number of asylum applications of Moroccans, drastically
growing from less than 10 in Q4 2015 to
almost 700 in the reporting period. FRAN
data show that they were preceded by illegal border-crossings from Serbia. Germany
registered a similarly high level of Moroccan applications for international protection. According to FRAN intra-Schengen
data, most of them were detected without valid travel documents on trains and
private vehicles coming from Austria.
Numbers of return decisions and
effective returns lower than in the
last quarter
In Q1 2015, Member State authorities issued 69 392 decisions to third country nationals with an obligation to leave the EU
following an administrative or judicial decision. Thus the number of return decisions has decreased by 10% compared to
last quarter and increased by 10% in relation to Q1 2015, although Member States

have been reporting increasing asylum
applications by migrants from countries
with low asylum recognition rates. This
downward trend was most visible in the
case of citizens of North African countries,
for whom this indicator, since last quarter,
decreased by 7% to 9 873 return decisions.
Also the number of effective returns reported by Member States has decreased
since last quarter, although to a lesser
extent. During the reporting period, almost 47 000 effective returns took place,
which is 3% less than in Q4 2015, and 25%
more than in Q1 2015. Fewer returns were
for example reported of citizens of Latin

Figures related to detections of facilitators of irregular migration have remained
on around the same levels as in Q4 2015.
Compared to one year ago, the number
of arrested facilitators grew by 12%, to
2 972 persons.

Western Balkan route

Lower migration pressure and
diversifying routes
The large migratory flows of the late summer and autumn of 2015 were channelled
on one main route across the Western
Balkans, thus the migrants’ movements
were more visible. Due to their sheer
number, however, it was difficult for the
authorities to identify and register all irregular migrants. For this reason, several
thousands of those who were registered
at the EU’s external border during 2015
are not yet registered as asylum seekers.

ways to transit the Western
Balkans

monitor

Greece to the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia:
Individual and group attempts
to cross the border
Most migrants who arrived in Greece and
made it to the mainland gathered at the port
of Piraeus and in different camps around
Idomeni. From Idomeni, the authorities have
reported various protests and group attempts to break through the fence to the
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
To avoid the increasing risk of unrest and
violence at the border to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, on 24 May,
Greece dismantled the Idomeni camp and
relocated most of its 9 000 residents to
shelters further away from the border.
Around half of them were brought to new
or existing official camps. Another 4 000
to 5 000 persons left Idomeni on their
own and moved into other nearby areas
and official or unofficial camps.
In spite of the relocations, several thousand still linger near the border with the

The current closure of the borders makes
it even more difficult for the border authorities in the region to maintain and
update the situational picture of the migratory flows. The majority of the persons
on the route are stranded in Greece and,
to a lesser extent, in the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia and Serbia. However, law-enforcement authorities cannot
always trace the whereabouts of those
groups that decided to bypass the border barriers to get to their destinations in
Western and Northern Europe. In this regard, the current situation of closed borders resembles the first half of 2015, when
the migrant routes through Europe were
more diversified, dynamic and dangerous.
The countries of the region have indeed re-

ported an increasing fragmentation of the
routes since the beginning of March 2016.

former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
It is expected that the Greek government
will continue to reorganise the accommodation system and reallocate migrants from
unofficial camps into official camps further away from the border with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. It is
estimated that all over Greece, at the end
of June, there were well over 57 000 migrants. Smaller numbers of persons coming from Turkey are constantly adding to
this number.
The authorities of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on the other side of
the border have reported continuously high
pressure on its police forces caused by violence and riots committed by migrants
resulting in serious damage, and ongoing
attempts to enter the country undetected.
Migrant smugglers are exploring new routes
and target areas of lower police surveillance
for their attempts of illegal border-crossings.

Serbia to Hungary:
Increasing number of illegal
border-crossings by breaking
through the fence
The completion of a fence along the Hungarian border with Serbia in mid-September, and with Croatia in mid-October 2015
had effectively stopped the migratory flow
through Hungary. With every measure of the
countries along the Western Balkan route to
curb the migratory flow, the number of illegal border-crossings has gradually increased.
In April and May 2016, the number of detections reported by Hungary was on its highest level since the completion of the fence.

Bulgaria to Serbia: Migration
flow on a relatively low level
but steadily increasing
Between February and April 2016, as least
12 hundred irregular migrants were apprehended on exit from Bulgaria at the Serbian
land border in the area covered by a Frontex-coordinated Joint Operation. The main
nationalities apprehended on exit to Serbia were Afghans, Iraqis and Pakistani. The
detections in this border area account for
most of the flow from Bulgaria to Serbia.

Migrants apprehended on exit to Serbia
claimed during interviews that they had
crossed the border from Turkey to Bulgaria at an unknown location and had
been transported by people smugglers
towards Sofia, where they had stayed for
several days in safe houses. At the same
time, Bulgaria detected around 900 illegal border-crossings at its land border
with Turkey. Apart from that route, also
migrants who were previously stranded
in Greek make-shift camps close to the
border with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia were assisted by people
smugglers to get to Bulgaria.
Later, migrants in Sofia were transported
near the Bulgarian-Serbian border, were
people smugglers again helped them to
cross the border on foot and tried to reach
Belgrade. From Belgrade they travelled to
the Hungarian land border, from where
they could reach other EU Member States.

Conclusion: More fragmented
migratory flows, though at
lower levels
The map in Figure 2 shows reported detections of illegal border-crossings and
number of migrants in permanent and
temporary facilities. It indicates that the restrictions along the Western Balkan route
have led to a significant decrease in irregular migration in this region. In contrast to
the period when the authorities allowed

and the transit of irregular migrants, the
route currently appears to be more diversified. More migrants try to bypass the
border between Greece and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, for example
taking the route via Albania. The detections
at the Albanian borders with Montenegro
and Bosnia, however, are very low and do
not confirm any major displacement of
the flow into these mountainous regions.
On the other hand, an increasing number
of migrants stranded in Greece have been
trying to find longer routes to circumvent
the border fence built by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
Further along the route, the number of illegal border-crossings between Serbia and
Hungary have reached the highest level
since Hungary has completed its fence
along the Hungarian border with its southern neighbours in mid-October 2015. Data
reported by Serbia, however, do not shed
any light on the previous route of those migrants detected on entry to Hungary. The
most likely explanation is that they came
from either Bulgaria or the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Greece.
The number of irregular migrants arriving in Austria confirms that since March,
the flow on the Western Balkan route has
shifted from Croatia and Slovenia back to
Hungary. While the route has diversified,
the total volume of the migratory flow is
far lower than in the second half of 2015.

Sources and Methods
For the data concerning detections at the
external borders, some of the border types
are not applicable to all FRAN Member
States. This pertains to data on all FRAN
indicators since the data are provided disaggregated by border type. The definitions
of detections at land borders are therefore not applicable (excluding borders with
non-Schengen principalities) for Belgium,
the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg,
Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden,
Switzerland and the UK. For Cyprus, the
land border refers to the Green Line demarcation with the area not under the effective control of the government of the
Republic of Cyprus. For sea borders, the
definitions are not applicable for landlocked Member States including Austria,
the Czech Republic, Hungary, Luxembourg,
Slovakia and Switzerland.
In addition, data on detections of illegal
border-crossing at land, air and sea BCPs
(1B) are not available for Iceland, Ireland
and Spain and in Greece (these detections
are included in the data for Indicator 1A).
Data for Norway only includes detections
of illegal border-crossing at land and sea
BCPs (1B), not between BCPs (1A).

Data on detections of illegal border-crossing between sea BCPs (1A) are not available for Ireland.
Data on apprehension (FRAN Indicator 2)
of facilitators is not available for Ireland.
For Italy, the data are not disaggregated
by border type, but are reported as total
apprehensions (not specified). Data for Italy and Norway also include the facilitation
of illegal stay and work. For Romania, the
data include land intra-EU detections on
exit at the border with Hungary.
For the data concerning detections of illegal stay (FRAN Indicator 3), data on detections at exit are not available for Denmark,
Ireland, Italy, Spain and the UK.
Data on refusals of entry (FRAN Indicator 4) at the external EU borders are not
disaggregated by reason of refusal for Ireland and the UK. Refusals of entry at the
Spanish land borders at Ceuta and Melilla
(without the issuance of a refusal form) are
reported separately and are not included
in the presented FRAN data.
The data on applications for international
protection (FRAN Indicator 5) are not dis-

aggregated by place of application (type
of border on entry or inland applications)
for Austria, the Czech Republic and Slovenia. For these countries, only the total
number of applications is reported. For
France, only asylum applications at the
external borders are reported, not inland
applications. For the UK, data reported for
applications at air BCPs also include applications at sea BCPs.
The data on return decisions issued (FRAN
Indicator 7A) are not available for Ireland,
France, the Netherlands and Sweden. The
data on effective returns (FRAN Indicator 7B) are not available for Ireland. In addition, the data of effective returns are not
disaggregated by return operation (voluntary and forced) for Spain. The data on
voluntary effective returns (FRAN Indicator 7A) are not disaggregated by type of return operation (IOM-assisted and others)
for Belgium, the Czech Republic, Finland
and the Netherlands. The data on forced
effective returns (FRAN Indicator 7A) are
not disaggregated by type of return operation (enforced by Member Stated and
by Joint Operations) for Belgium, Finland,
Iceland and the Netherlands.
