Frontex official publications fall into four main categories: risk analysis, training,
operations and research, each marked with a distinct graphic identifier. Risk analysis
publications bear a triangular symbol formed by an arrow drawing a triangle, with
a dot at the centre. Metaphorically, the arrow represents the cyclical nature of risk
analysis processes and its orientation towards an appropriate operational response.
The triangle is a symbol of ideal proportions and knowledge, reflecting the pursuit
of factual exactness, truth and exhaustive analysis. The dot at the centre represents
the intelligence factor and the focal point where information from diverse sources
converges to be processed, systematised and shared as analytical products. Thus,
Frontex risk analysis is meant to be at the centre and to form a reliable basis for its
operational activities.

Introduction

Concept
The Western Balkans Risk Analysis Network (WB-RAN) performs monthly exchanges of statistical data and information
on the most recent irregular migration
developments affecting the region. This
information is compiled at Frontex Risk
Analysis Unit (RAU) level and analysed in
cooperation with the regional partners on
a quarterly and annual basis. The annual
reports offer a more in-depth analysis of
the developments and phenomena which
impact the regional and common borders, while the quarterly reports are meant
to provide regular updates and identify
emerging trends in order to maintain situational awareness. Both types of reports
are aimed at offering support for strategic
and operational decision making.

Methodology
The Western Balkans Quarterly is focused
on quarterly developments as reflected by
the seven key indicators of irregular migration: (1) detections of illegal bordercrossing between BCPs, (2) detections of
illegal border-crossing at BCPs, (3) refusals of entry, (4) detections of illegal stay,
(5) asylum applications, (6) detections of
facilitators, and (7) detections of fraudulent documents.1

1

Please note that the analysis of this indicator
is now limited to WB-RAN countries
only, given that EU Member States have
transitioned to the European Union
Document-Fraud (EDF) reporting scheme.

The data presented in the overview are
derived from monthly statistics provided
within the framework of the WB-RAN
and reference-period statistics from common border sections of neighbouring EU
Member States (Croatia, Bulgaria, Greece,
Hungary and Romania). In addition, the
Western Balkans Quarterly is drawing
from FRAN Quarterly reports and also
from data analysed in the framework
of other risk analysis networks (FRAN,
EDF-RAN).

Structure
The first part offers a general situational
overview broken down by main areas of
work of border-control authorities and
police activities related to irregular migration. The second part presents more
in-depth featured risk analyses of particular phenomena. As the current issue
of the Western Balkans Quarterly is the
fifth following a new approach adopted
for risk analysis quarterlies, the structure
of the report may still be subject to some
readjustments.
Changes in data scope after Croatia’s
entry to the EU
Important changes in the collection and
use of data for Western Balkans Quarterlies were introduced upon Croatia’s joining
the EU in July 2013. Firstly, data for Slovenia, which now has no external borders
with non-EU Western Balkan countries,

have not been included in the report since
the third quarter of 2013. Slovenian historical data were also excluded from the tables in order to make the comparison with
previous quarters analytically meaningful.
Secondly, as the Croatian-Hungarian and
Croatian-Slovenian border sections are
now internal EU-borders and so they are
no longer covered by this report.
Thirdly, after joining the EU, Croatian data
on illegal stay data are limited to detections at the border. More precisely, Croatia’s illegal stay data only include cases
detected on exit, while inland detections
are not included. The analysis of the illegal stay indicator takes this fact into
consideration.
Changes in data scope after Kosovo*’s
entry to the WB-RAN
Starting from the first quarter of 2014,
data from Kosovo* on key indicators of
irregular migration have been included in
the reporting, making it possible to get a
more comprehensive picture of the irregular movements in the region. However,
as there are no historical data available for
Kosovo*, the new data have some impact
on the comparison of the examined period
with previous quarters. When necessary
for analytical purposes, some comparison
can be made also excluding data from Kosovo*, which is noted in the text.

Situation at the border

Border surveillance
Illegal border-crossings
During the analysed period, 215 000 illegal border-crossings by non-regional migrants en route from Turkey, Greece and
Bulgaria were reported at the common
and regional borders (see Fig. 2). This represents an 84% decrease compared with
the previous quarter, which was an alltime record.

only fewer than 2 500 of the illegal bordercrossings in the Western Balkans in Q1 2016
were associated with regional migrants.

The decrease could be observed during all
the three months of the quarter but was
more visible in February and March, when
coordinated restriction measures were introduced at regional level and, ultimately,
the transit corridor was closed. After the
closure in March 2016, the number of detections dropped to the level close to that
of the same month in 2015, i.e. before the
migratory crisis significantly worsened in
the Western Balkans. At the same time,

Following the overall drop, Syrians and
Afghans remained the two main nationalities, accounting for 21% and 14%, respectively, of the total non-regional migration
flow. A high number of migrants was still
reported as ‘unknown’ (despite being 79%
lower compared to the last quarter of 2015,
the number of such cases in the analysed
period accounted for 51% of the non-regional total).
Iraqi migrants continued to be the third
most detected nationality, followed by
Pakistanis, Iranians and Moroccans. All of
these nationalities registered significant
drops in relation to the previous quarter.
Together, these top six nationalities accounted for 48% of the non-regional migration flow between BCPs, while the
nationality of 51% of detected persons was
reported as ‘unknown’.
The detections of Western Balkan regional
migrants was 34% lower than in the previous quarter and only represented less
than 1% of the overall flow affecting the
region. When analysing information available since 2009, a decrease in regional migrants between Q4 and Q1 appears to be
a natural development. During the analysed period the drop was mainly linked to
lower numbers of Albanian migrants reported at the Greek-Albanian border. This
is in line with the lower number of available jobs in Greece during the first quarter of the year, a situation which usually
changes during the warm season.
Despite the overall decrease, the majority (67%) of Western Balkan country nationals detected for illegal border-crossing
continued to be reported at the Greek-Albanian border. The second busiest section
was the Hungarian-Serbian border, which
took 18% of the regional flow.

main point of exit from the region,
but after the closure of the corridor,
the Hungarian-Serbian section gained
importance; the regional flow was still
mainly restricted to the Greek-Albanian
border

During the first quarter of 2016, the number of detected facilitators was 261, showing a decrease for the second consecutive

Facilitators

Considering that there were more than
215 000 illegal border-crossings associated
with non-regional nationals, this very low
total of detected facilitators indicates that
migrants were increasingly able to self-organise and/or relied on authorities when it
came to travel arrangements for transiting
the region before the corridor was closed
at the beginning of March.

However, the decision to close the organised transit corridor is likely to increase
migrants’ demand for people smuggling
services in the future making facilitation
activities more profitable.
In terms of nationalities, 66% of all facilitators detected in the analysed quarter were
nationals of Western Balkan countries,

21% were citizens of EU Member States, especially those neighbouring the region, and
13% were nationals of third countries from
outside the region or ‘unknown’. The highest share of detections was still reported
by Serbia, mostly involving Serbian nationals, followed by Greece, which mostly
reported Albanians, Afghans and Greeks.

Situational
overview

Border checks
Clandestine entries
In Q1 2016, a total of 385 non-regional migrants were detected while attempting to
illegally cross the borders hiding in vehicles. This represents a more than tenfold
increase compared to Q4 2015 and the
highest number of such detections in the
past four quarters. This overall increase is
mostly linked to higher numbers of Moroccan and Algerian migrants reported
especially at the Hungarian-Serbian and
Croatian-Serbian borders. Afghans and
Iranians also contributed to this rise, being mostly reported at the Serbia-former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Croatian-Serbian border.

Document fraud
During the first quarter, there were 236
cases of false document use reported by
the six Western Balkan countries, a number 7% higher than that of the previous
quarter.
Serbia continued to rank first in terms of
detections, followed by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania. As
regards nationalities detected in Q1 2016,

Albanian and Kosovo* citizens continued
to rank top amongst false document users, accounting for 33% and 28% of all detections, respectively.
Passports, ID cards and residence permits were the most commonly detected
false documents. Unsurprisingly, a large
majority of ID cards were EU Member
States’ documents, as they can be used
to move freely within the Schengen area
and the EU.
As far as detections of false passports are
concerned, the majority were reportedly
issued by countries of the region. The majority of these documents were Albanian,
mostly used by Albanian nationals most
likely in an attempt to avoid entry bans imposed for prior misuse of visa liberalisation.

Refusals of entry
In the analysed period, the number of refusals of entry decreased by 9% compared
with the previous quarter: from roughly
9 600 to 8 800. This decline appears to
be broadly consistent with seasonal trends
caused by lower tourist mobility as the
number of refusals issued was relatively

stable compared with the corresponding
quarter of 2015. Turkish nationals ranked
fourth among the refused nationalities,
thus occupying a top position for the third
consecutive quarter, despite a 32% reduction in relation to Q4 2015.
As usual, a large majority of refusals of
entry were issued at land borders (89%),
while the remaining 11% were mainly reported at air borders.
Most of the refusals reported by the neighbouring EU Member States were issued
to nationals of Western Balkan countries
(91%). In turn, among those refused entry
by the six countries of the region, 39% were
local residents, 26% were Turkish nationals and 24% were nationals of EU Member
States/Schengen Associated Countries.
The overall number of refusals issued to
the non-regional nationalities associated
with the migratory flow originating from
Turkey/Greece continued to represent a
low share of the total (i.e. Syrians, Afghans
and Iraqis accounted for 45% of the reported illegal border-crossings between
BCPs, but were only issued 3% of the refusals of entry at regional level).

reach the EU by taking advantage of the high migration pressure

Situation in the Western Balkans

Illegal stay in Western Balkan countries
There were 834 detections of illegal stay
reported by the six Western Balkan countries during Q1 2016, a number that is 6%
higher than that in the previous quarter, but very low considering the overall
volume of the flow transiting the region
over the recent period. The number was
also significantly lower than in the corresponding quarter of 2015 (-33%). This development can be attributed to the fact
that until the beginning of March migrants tried to cross the Western Balkans as fast as possible using organised
transportation services before border

closures or other restrictions were put
into effect.

stayers and were mainly reported by Montenegro and Serbia.

During the analysed quarter, Serbian and
Albanian nationals continued to rank
first and second, respectively, among
detected illegal stayers. Citizens of Serbia were mainly reported by Montenegro and, to a lesser extent, by Bosnia
and Herzegovina, while the Albanians
seem to have preferred staying in the
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Nationals of Bosnia and Herzegovina ranked third in detections of illegal

The large discrepancy between the number of detected illegal border-crossings
by the non-regional migrants originating from Greece/Turkey (over 107 000
reported by the six Western Balkan countries) and that of detected illegal stayers
of corresponding nationalities (e.g. only
17 Iraqis, 12 Afghans, 7 Iranians and 6 Syrians) indicates that the Western Balkans
region continued to be mainly regarded
as a transit area.

The number of detected illegal border-crossings associated with the nonregional transiting flow registered a
significant decrease in the first quarter.
Specifically, the 215 000 illegal bordercrossings between BCPs reported in the
analysed period represent an 84% reduction in relation to the last quarter of 2015.
Detections at the common and regional
borders have fallen substantially each
consecutive month in Q1 2016, from
128 000 in January to 74 000 in February and finally to just 13 000 in March.
Starting at the end of 2015 and through
the first quarter of 2016, the countries
most affected by the non-regional flow
transiting the Western Balkans started
to increase their coordination in order to
better tackle the high migration pressure.

Detections of non-regional
migrants stabilise at lower
levels after the EU-Turkey
statement

The first common restriction measure
was agreed at the end of November when
only Syrian, Afghan and Iraqi migrants
were allowed transit while all others
started being filtered out from the flow.
Despite being difficult to implement due
to insufficient screeners and interpreters and the fact that many migrants resorted to nationality swapping in order
to slip through, this decision set the stage
for further trans-regional actions.
During February 2016, several high-level
meetings of regional police chiefs and
ministers were organised, each resulting
in the application of more coordinated
and gradual transit restrictions. The restrictions ranged from requiring migrants
to document their nationality, origin from
war-torn areas, a previous registration in
Greece all the way to imposing daily transit quotas, refusing entry to migrants who
had resided in other safe countries for a

longer period or who did not fully cooperate with the authorities.
All of these increased filtering activities
led to a decrease in the number of persons allowed transit based on the regional
arrangements, while also resulting in a
certain accumulation of migratory pressure inside Greece, and especially on its
border with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
In order to cope with the high numbers
of refused persons trying to force their
passage, the authorities in Skopje increased the number of police forces on
their southern border while also erecting
a two-layer fence planned to cover the
most sensitive areas. As the success of all
planned restriction measures greatly depended on the capacity to properly prevent entries across the border between
Greece and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, other regional countries also sent reinforcements to this area.
On 9 March, the Slovenian and Croatian
authorities announced a complete closure
of the facilitated transit corridor and the
return to the normal application of the
Schengen Borders Code and legislation
governing international travel.
As a result, pressure continued to accumulate in Greece fuelled by migrants who
continued to make their journey from
Turkey across the Aegean Sea and to the
border with the former Yugoslav Republic
of Macedonia. They set on their journey
hoping that the authorities would give
in to pressure and reopen the corridor.
More than 12 000 migrants quickly accumulated in the Idomeni area in northern Greece, irregularly camping there and
constantly trying to force their way across

wb-ran · q1 2016

the border to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
Despite the massive pressure, the authorities managed to maintain the transit corridor closed, putting a halt to the
momentum gained by the migratory flow
in previous months and sending an important message to others who were
still contemplating making the journey
via Greece and the Balkans.

Furthermore, the EU-Turkey statement
aimed at stemming the migration flow
entered into force on 20 March, bringing
about enhanced patrolling by the Turkish
authorities and other activities aimed at
preventing departures in the Eastern Aegean Sea. The statement also envisioned
effective returns of migrants from Greece.
Moreover, migrants arriving in Greece after March 20 have been accommodated
in closed reception facilities for almost
one month pending processing and a final
decision regarding their return to Turkey
or eventual relocation to the EU should
they qualify for this option. The prospect
of being kept in a closed facility and facing a possible return to Turkey (despite
spending money on facilitation) played
an important role in decreasing arrivals
on the Aegean Islands.

The perception that the transit corridor
via the Western Balkans was no longer
available contributed to a contraction in
the number of arrivals on the Eastern Aegean Islands (see Fig. 8), as many migrants
appear to be attracted by the prospect
of easy, cheap and well organised travel
(see box on page 12).

II. Featured risk analysis

While the survey’s sample is not statistically representative of the overall Iraqi
migrant population that arrived in the EU

in 2015, the results are still quite telling.
Importantly, they indicate that most of
information campaign efforts that aim
at reaching would-be migrants should
be tailored and delivered through informal channels, social media and relevant
Internet information hubs. Furthermore,
if the appeal of the Eastern Mediterranean / Western Balkans were reduced,
many would-be migrants could postpone their decision to move to the EU
for the future, possibly leading to a contraction of the flow.

Top most important information gathered to plan the
journey

Most important source of information for planning
the journey

IOM survey suggests that most migrants consider the availability and costs
of travel options as most important factors before starting their journey
In November and December 2015 (the
peak period of Iraqi arrivals in the EU), the
IOM conducted a survey on 473 Iraqi migrants who had left their country over the
previous year and were residing in Europe.
The survey produced several important
findings. Firstly, when deciding whether
to go or to stay, most respondents were
mainly searching information on routes
and costs. This indicates the high importance of these two factors in the decision-making process. Information on life
in their preferred destination country was
largely a very secondary concern.

their journey and about the sources they
relied upon. Unsurprisingly, the most important sources were word of mouth, followed by social media and the Internet.
All other sources, including local TV or
other media are dwarfed in comparison.
