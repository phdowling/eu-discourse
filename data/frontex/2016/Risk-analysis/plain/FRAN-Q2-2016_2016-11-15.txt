Frontex official publications fall into four main categories: risk analysis, training,
operations and research, each marked with a distinct graphic identifier. Risk analysis
publications bear a triangular symbol formed by an arrow drawing a triangle, with
a dot at the centre. Metaphorically, the arrow represents the cyclical nature of risk
analysis processes and its orientation towards an appropriate operational response.
The triangle is a symbol of ideal proportions and knowledge, reflecting the pursuit
of factual exactness, truth and exhaustive analysis. The dot at the centre represents
the intelligence factor and the focal point where information from diverse sources
converges to be processed, systematised and shared as analytical products. Thus,
Frontex risk analysis is meant to be at the centre and to form a reliable basis for its
operational activities.

Introduction

FRAN Quarterly reports are prepared by
the Frontex Risk Analysis Unit and provide
a regular overview of irregular migration
at the EU external borders, based on the
irregular migration data exchanged among
Member State border-control authorities
within the cooperative framework of the
Frontex Risk Analysis Network (FRAN)
and its subsidiary, the European Union
Document-Fraud Risk Analysis Network
(EDF-RAN).

in this report should be interpreted with
caution and, where possible, cross-referenced with information from other
sources. The statistics should be understood in the context of the different levels of passenger flows passing through
different border sections, the activities
of Member State border-control authorities undertaken to secure different border sections and widespread variation in
reporting and data-collection practices.

The main purpose of the FRAN Quarterlies is to provide:
1.	feedback to the FRAN community in
the context of information exchange;
2.	a periodic update to the situational picture of irregular migration at EU level;
and
3.	material for constructive discussion on
reporting protocols and related trends
and patterns.
This report is intended to simultaneously
serve two objectives: first – to provide a
clear summary of the situation at the external border of the EU, and second – to
serve as an archive for future reference
and comparative analyses.

FRAN members and Member State risk
analysis experts and border-control authorities are considered the primary customers of these reports. In addition to
the discussions taking place during FRAN
meetings, Member State experts are invited and actively encouraged to examine
and comment upon the data and analyses presented here. Despite all efforts of
the Frontex Risk Analysis Unit and Member State experts involved in data exchange and analyses, some minor errors
may occur in these reports due to very
challenging timelines and the growing
volume and complexity of the data and
other information exchanged within the
FRAN community.

Harmonising complex, multi-source migration data among Frontex and Member
States is an ongoing process. Therefore,
some of the more detailed data and trends

Starting with the 2015 Q1 issue, the Frontex Risk Analysis Unit has implemented a
number of changes to present the analysis
of migration related indicators in the FRAN

Quarterly in a more concise and focused
way.
The first part provides a situational overview, broken down by main areas of work
of border-control authorities and police
activities related to irregular migration.
n	
Surveillance, describing and analysing
trends in detections of illegal bordercrossing between BCPs;
n	
Border checks, describing detections
reported during checks at BCPs (people hiding in vehicles or refused entry);
n	
Fraudulent documents, describing
trends and patterns related to document fraud both at the border and
within the EU;
n	
Situation in the EU, examining developments related to persons applying
for asylum and those detected staying illegally, detected facilitators, return decisions and effective returns.
The second thematic part of the report
consists of featured risk analyses, examining trends and patterns of irregular
migration in a more comprehensive manner. Eventually it is expected that some of
the featured analysis topics would be developed by external contributors (FRAN
members, EU agencies and international
institutions).

Methodology

The current 32nd issue of the FRAN Quarterly is a comparative analysis of FRAN
data collected between April and June
2016 and exchanged between 31 Member
State border-control authorities within the
framework of the Frontex Risk Analysis
Network. The report presents the results
of statistical analysis of quarterly changes
of irregular-migration indicators aggregated at the level of the event. Analytical reports exchanged by Member States
were also used for interpretative purposes
and to provide qualitative information, as
were other available sources of information, such as Frontex Joint Operations.
Precise definitions of Indicators 1 to 6,
aimed at harmonising the data exchanged
at EU level, were presented in the annexes
of the Q1 and Q2 reports of 2009 and are
therefore not repeated here.

The FRAN data exchange has been in
place since September 2008. Data are
exchanged through the ICONet Internet
platform, an interest group of the European Commission’s CIRCA server. Member
State monthly data are based on a country template prepared by the Frontex Risk
Analysis Unit. The deadline for submitting
data for each month is the 20th day of the
subsequent month, with the exception of
the end-of-year data, which are requested
by 15 January each year. For this 32nd issue of the FRAN Quarterly, the target for
Member States to upload the monthly
data was thus 20 July 2016. In principle,
data submitted subsequent to this date
will be reflected in the next FRAN Quarterly, except in cases where clarification
is needed in order to proceed with comprehensive analysis.

In January 2012, the European Union Document-Fraud Risk Analysis Network (EDFRAN) was formed as a specialist forum
to oversee the exchange and analyses of
detections of document fraud at the EU’s
external borders and on all international
flights to the EU. The data were backdated
and merged with those exchanged under a
pilot Tailored Risk Analysis released in 2011.
At the beginning of 2014, Member States
started to regularly collect quantitative
information on indicators related to secondary movements. Moreover, in July 2014,
Frontex organised workshops for Member State experts to gather their insights
and analyse available data. Their input
was essential for the analysis of intra-EU/
Schengen secondary movements of undocumented migrants.

fran · q2 2016

External borders refer to the borders between Member States and third countries.
The borders between Schengen Associated
Countries (Liechtenstein, Norway, Iceland
and Switzerland) and third countries are
considered as external borders as well. In
turn, the borders between Schengen Associated Countries and Schengen Member
States are considered as internal borders.
For the indicators on detections of facilitators, illegal stay and asylum, statistics
are also reported for detections at the
land borders between Schengen Member States and Schengen candidates (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania) or
non-Schengen Member States (the UK and
Ireland), so that a total for Member States

and Schengen Associated Countries as a
whole can be presented. It was not possible to make this distinction for air and
sea borders since Member States do not
habitually differentiate between extraEU and intra-EU air and sea connections
but tend to aggregate data for all arrivals.
When data are examined at the level of
third-country nationalities, a large percentage usually falls under the category
of either ‘Other (not specified)’ or ‘Unknown’. It is expected that the percentage reported under these categories will
decrease with time as Member States improve the quality and speed of their identification, data collection and reporting

practices. It should be noted that if an individual’s nationality cannot be established
before reports are submitted, it will be reported as ‘Unknown’.

Acknowledgements
The Frontex Risk Analysis Unit would like
to express its gratitude to all FRAN and
EDF-RAN members and their associates
in Member State statistical, migration and
document-fraud units who collect, aggregate and exchange monthly data, but
also to the analysts who compile the bimonthly analytical reports, on which much
of the detailed analyses presented here
are based.

A closer look at the data reported by the
Member States, however, indicates large
differences in trends of irregular migration between the main routes.
At the EU’s external borders with Turkey, the migratory pressure has been constantly easing since last winter. First, the
agreement between the EU and Turkey has
removed the incentives to move on irregular routes to Greece and undermined the
business model of people smuggling networks. Second, the developments on the
Western Balkan route have discouraged
many from making a dangerous sea crossing to reach the Eastern Aegean Islands.
A similar decline has been observed on the
Western Balkan route, where most of the
migrants crossed the EU’s external border for a second time after arriving on the
Eastern Aegean Islands. Through the common efforts of Western Balkan countries
to gradually stop the massive secondary
migratory movements transiting the re-

gion, the number of detected illegal border-crossings reported from the Western
Balkan route decreased by 90% between
Q1 and Q2 2016.

Trend
Monthly trends, October 2012 to June 2016
Reported cases

Because of the steady decline in irregular
migration on the Eastern Mediterranean
and Western Balkan routes, in April 2016
the level of irregular migration reported
from the Central Mediterranean route was
for the first time in a year higher than on
any other route. Across the Central Mediterranean Sea, the level of migratory flows
was comparable with previous second
quarters. As usual during this season, the
number of boats departing from North
African shores was rising as the maritime
weather conditions were improving. Assets deployed in the Joint Operation EPN
Triton, however, registered a growing importance of Egypt as departure place, even
if Libya remained the most common country of departure for migrant boats.

In Q2 2016, the number of detections of
illegal border-crossing reported by Spain
on the Western Mediterranean route was
higher than in any other second quarter
since the FRAN data collection began. As
many as 95% of all detections were made
at the sea border with Morocco, mostly involving nationals of West African countries.
In spite of the drastic general decrease
in irregular migration, the number of detections of illegal stay remained high, well
above the level that was commonly reported before the 2015 migrant crisis. Most
illegal stayers were reported from Germany, closely followed by France.

Q2 2016

After the FRAN indicators of illegal border-crossing between BCPs, illegal stay and
asylum hit record levels in the second half
of 2015, the values dropped significantly by
the second quarter of 2016. The irregular
migration pressure at the EU’s external
borders has been continuously easing after October 2015. The total number of illegal border-crossings during the reviewed
period amounted to less than half of the
number reported one year before, but the
level of irregular migration in Q2 2016 remained significantly higher than before
the crisis year of 2015.

FRAN data for the period of April–June 2016
show a 55% decrease in overall detections of
illegal border-crossing compared with the
same period of 2015. The 75 044 detections
reported in Q2 2016 clearly fell short of the
2015 record, but the migratory pressure remained far above the average reported in
the second quarter in 2008–2014. The substantial drop in irregular migration from
Turkey to Greece and an increased number of migrants in the Central Mediterranean have led to a shift in proportions of
particular nationalities. Most detections of
all illegal border-crossing were related to
Eritreans and Nigerians (both about 11%),
closely followed by Afghans (10%), whereas
Syrians accounted for only 6% of all illegal
border-crossings.
Further decrease in migratory
pressure on the Eastern
Mediterranean route
The agreement between the EU and Turkey combined with the international efforts
to close the Western Balkan route have resulted in a massive reduction of irregular
migration in the Eastern Aegean Sea. On
this route, irregular migration decreased
to a level that is clearly not only lower than
that of the crisis year of 2015, but also below the average of all second quarters since

8 of 37

2008. As a result, the Eastern Mediterranean
route is no longer the most common entry
point for irregular migration to the EU, as
the number of illegal border-crossings reported there fell below 9 000. Most irregular migrants on this route were detected
on boats in the Eastern Aegean Sea or already on a Greek island such as Lesbos, Samos or Chios.
Only 32% of the irregular migrants claimed
to be of Syrian nationality, compared with
58% in Q2 2015. While the share of Afghan
nationals also decreased to one-fifth of the
total migration flow, the proportion of Pakistani nationals compared with one year
before increased from 6% to 15%. Algerians
were among the few nationalities whose
number increased in absolute terms.
Influx of migrants leads to intensified
secondary movements
Most irregular migrants who arrived in
Greece or Bulgaria continued their journey across Western Balkan countries towards western and northern Europe. With
the efforts of south-eastern European governments to close their borders for irregular migrants, the number of detections
has also been decreasing on the Western
Balkan route.

With 11 102 detections in Q2 2016, the number of illegal border-crossings on the Western Balkan route amounted to a third of
the number reported in Q2 2015 but only
a tenth of the number reported in Q1 2016.
Until February, most attempted illegal entries from Western Balkan countries to the
EU were reported from Croatia’s border
with Serbia. From April on, irregular migration via Croatia and Slovenia has effectively stopped and almost all irregular flows
across the Western Balkans were reported
from the Hungarian-Serbian border. In Q2
2016, more than 100 illegal border-crossings were reported by Croatia, while Hungary registered almost 11 000 persons who
broke through the fence from Serbia.
In the first quarter of 2016, as during the
peak of the 2015 migration crisis, the nationalities of the majority of migrants in the
Western Balkans were not reported by Member States due to the sheer numbers of persons arriving. In Q2 2016, however, Member
States were once again able to report the
nationality of most irregular migrants on the
Western Balkan route, revealing significant
differences in the proportions between the
migrant nationalities on both routes. While
Syrians amounted for 32% of the detections
on the Eastern Mediterranean route, they
only represented 11% of illegal border-cross-

ings on the Western Balkan route. On the
other hand, on the Eastern Mediterranean
route every fifth registered irregular migrant
was an Afghan national, while on the Western Balkan route, almost every second detection was related to this nationality.
High irregular migration flows on the
Central Mediterranean route
The decline in irregular migration in the Eastern Aegean Sea and the Western Balkans
has made the Central Mediterranean route
the most important one in Q2 2016 in terms
of the number of irregular migrants. In fact,
51 450 people were detected in an attempt
to reach the EU by making a dangerous sea
crossing, 14% less than during Q2 2015, but
174% more than in Q1 2016, when adverse sea
conditions made the crossing extremely difficult. The detections were almost exclusively
made as part of Search and Rescue operations following a distress call on a satellite
phone, mostly made from migrant boats.
Assets deployed in the Joint Operation EPN
Triton have also registered a change in relative shares of departure countries: In the
second quarter of 2015, 92% of all migrants
detected in the Central Mediterranean departed from Libya, while only 4% came from
Egypt. However, the share of migrants com-

Guinea
Côte d'Ivoire

Nigeria

ing from Egypt increased to 14%, while less
than three-quarters of all migrants trying
to reach Italy had left from Libya.
The shift was mainly caused by migrants
from the Horn of Africa, who increasingly
avoided Libya as a transit country due to its
deteriorating security situation and decided
instead to take the route through Egypt, but
also by an increasing number of Egyptians
leaving their country. In fact, more than onethird of the migrants departing from Egypt
in Q2 2016 came from the Horn of Africa
and 31% were Egyptian nationals. In contrast, migrant boats departing from Libya
were mostly boarded by West African nationals. Every fifth migrant who departed
from Libya in the second quarter of 2016
was a Nigerian national.
Detections of irregular migration to
Spain higher than one year ago
On the Western Mediterranean route, Spain
reported the highest irregular migratory
pressure of any second quarter since FRAN
data collection began. With almost 2 000
detections, the number of illegal bordercrossings was 15% higher than in Q2 2015
and 42% higher than during the first quarter of 2016. This growth was mostly due to
a greater number of people trying to cross

the sea border from Morocco to Spain, especially Guineans and Ivorians, whose number increased by 93% and 146% respectively,
compared with the same period of 2015.
These two nationalities were also the most
commonly reported nationalities of the migrants detected on the Western African
route from Morocco to the Canary Islands,
where the number of detected illegal border-crossings slightly increased in Q2 2016.
In contrast, at the land border between Morocco and the Spanish exclaves of Ceuta and
Melilla, the number of detected illegal border-crossings decreased from almost 300
in Q2 2015 to slightly more than 100 during
the reference period.
Fewer detections of illegal bordercrossing from Albania to Greece
In Q2 2016, the Greek authorities reported
the lowest number of illegal border-crossings on the circular route from Albania since
2011. At the eastern borders, detections of illegal border-crossing amounted to 370 detections in Q2 2016, which represents a 27%
decrease compared to Q2 2015. For the first
time, the highest number of illegal bordercrossings on this route was reported at the
border between the Russian Federation and
Latvia, of which 78% were related to Vietnamese national.

Member States report a 13% increase
in refusals of entry compared to last
quarter
In Q2 2016, 33 792 refusals of entry were
issued at the EU external borders, the
highest number over the past six years.
Again, as over the past two years, the
most reported nationality were Ukrainians, to whom 6 694 refusals were issued.
Almost 80% of the reported Ukrainians
were refused at the Polish land border. In
most cases Ukrainians were not let into
the EU because they were unable to present appropriate documentation justifying the purpose and conditions of stay.
Albanian nationals ranked second with
4 733 refusals, showing a 31% increase
compared to the previous quarter and the
highest number since FRAN data collection began. Almost 40% of the reported
Albanian citizens were refused at the
Greek land border. The largest percentage increase (+63%) related to Albanians was reported by Croatia, where 560

refusals were issued to this nationality.
In general, the majority of Albanian nationals was refused because of an alert
existing in the SIS or a national register.
Compared with the previous quarter, the
number of refusals issued to Russian nationals increased by 88% to 4 662. An upward trend was not only reported from
the Polish (+125%) but, to a lesser extent, also from the Lithuanian land border (+54%). In the vast majority of the
cases, the refused Russian travellers held
no valid visa or residence permit.
The number of refusals issued to Latin
Americans reached the highest level in
four years. Compared with the previous quarter, Member States reported
a rise of 22% and exceeded 3 000 refusals. The highest share was related to
passengers of Brazil and Colombia, who
were issued 11% and 61% more refusals,
respectively, than during the first quarter of 2016, mostly by Spain and Portugal.

Fewer detections of clandestine
entry in Hungary and Bulgaria
Intensified border checks especially along
the Western Balkan route meant to prevent irregular migration across the EU’s
external borders did not lead to increased
detections of clandestine entries. Compared with the previous quarter, the
number of irregular migrants entering
the EU hiding in lorries and other vehicles decreased by 39% to 358 detections
in Q2 2016. The most significant decrease
between the first quarter and second
quarter of 2016 was reported by Hungary.
Bulgaria reported its lowest number of
clandestine entries in two years’ time:
71% of which involved Syrian nationals.
Only Spain reported a substantial 50% increase in clandestine entries, all of which
were reported from its land borders with
Morocco. Almost 90% of the irregular migrants were nationals of Guinea.

Many detections of illegal stay on
exit related to asylum seekers
The number of detections of illegal stay
on departure from the EU or Schengen
area has remained rather stable for the
past three quarters. During the reporting period, 19 288 people were detected
on exit without valid documents proving
their permission to stay. The FRAN data
collection does not cover the reason for
illegal stay, so the cases of illegal stay detected on exit include migrants who had
either crossed the border to an EU Member State/Schengen Associated Country
illegally, abused legal channels, or initially
entered the EU Member State/Schengen
Associated Country legally but no longer
fulfilled the conditions of stay or residence.
The reported numbers do only not reflect
the number of illegal stayers on exit, but
also the extent to which border guard authorities in different Member States check
documents of passengers when leaving
the EU or Schengen area. Discrepancies

in detection numbers between Member
States comparable in size and passenger
flow point to different practises of border
authorities in this regard.
The strongest increase in detections of illegal stay on exit was reported by Poland.
Compared with the previous quarter, the
Member State reported an increase of 43%
to around 3 000 detections, the highest
number since the FRAN data collection
began in 2007. The increase was mostly
due to more Ukrainian nationals leaving
the country through land BCPs without
being able to show a valid permission to
stay. To a lesser extent, the number of Russian and Moldovan citizens also increased.
In Q2 2016, Germany reported more than
7 000 detections of illegal stay on exit, the
highest number among all Member States
since 2007, when FRAN data collection
began. According to FRAN data, the majority of the nationalities detected for illegal stay on exit from Germany were also
among the top-ranking nationalities of

those claiming asylum in this country. The
five highest-ranking nationals reported for
illegal stay on exit (Iraqi, Albanian, Kosovo*,
Turkish, and Iranian citizens) also submitted 25% of the asylum applications in Q2
2016. The combination of these two indicators seems to point to a significant number of asylum applicants who voluntarily
decide to return to their home countries.
With over 2 000 detections, the country
reporting the third largest number in this
category was Hungary, in spite of a small
decrease since last quarter. The largest
share was detected during border checks
on exit to Romania, where 88% of all detected illegal stayers were Moldovan nationals. At the borders with Serbia and
Croatia, 92% of all detections were related
to Western Balkan nationals who could
not provide documents confirming a valid
permission to stay. Hungary also reported
a substantial number of detections under
this category from its BCPs with Ukraine,
which were almost exclusively related to
Ukrainian nationals.

Record low number of document
fraud detections in Q2 2016
In Q2 2016, the overall number of document fraud cases reported through the
EDF-RAN (4 731 document fraud cases
and almost 5 400 detected fraudulent
documents) was 8% lower than in the
previous quarter. At the same time, Q2
2016 saw the lowest number of document fraud detections since the beginning of 2013.
Overall, the EDF-RAN started to register
lower figures of document fraud starting from September 2015, which is also
the month when the migratory pressure
started rising exponentially. According
to EDF data, the closure of the Western
Balkan route has not yet caused any significant increase of the demand for fraudulent documents to be used on air routes.

12 of 37

Further overall decrease in
document fraud detections on
intra-EU/Schengen movements
The reported decrease at the external
borders also affected the overall situation
on intra-EU/Schengen movements. Nevertheless, the number of document fraud
detections on the secondary movements
within the EU/Schengen area remained
higher than for other travel types, with
over 2 500 people presenting fraudulent
documents. Furthermore, the number of
document fraudsters intending to reach
the UK decreased. In fact, in Q2 2016, over
900 persons were detected with fraudulent documents moving on the routes towards the UK. The most frequently used
were the sea and land routes between
France and the UK, where Albanian and
Ukrainian document fraudsters were often detected. On the air routes, mostly departing from Italy, Germany and Spain, the
most detected nationalities were Albanians, Iranians, Chinese and Iraqis nationals.

In contrast to the decreasing trend on
the routes towards the UK from other EU
Member States, the number of persons
travelling with fraudulent documents on
intra-EU/Schengen movements towards
Germany increased almost three times
compared with Q1 2016, amounting to
almost 300 cases in Q2 2016. The number of detections on the routes towards
Germany reached its highest level since
the beginning of 2013. The vast majority
of cases were detected on arrival from
Greece and were almost exclusively related to Syrian, Iraqi, Afghani and Iranian nationals. This indicates that after
the closure of the Western Balkan route,
migrants stranded in Greece once again
started to use fraudulent documents on
intra-Schengen flights to reach their desired final destination. This trend will most
likely persist in the coming months as
there are tens of thousands of migrants
stuck in Greece and new arrivals on the
Eastern Aegean islands are constantly
reported.

On the air routes, increased numbers of
document fraud detections in Q2 2016
were also revealed on connections from
Greece to Austria and Switzerland. The
nationalities of the offenders are similar to the ones on the routes heading for
Germany. On the other hand, the current
increase on the air routes between Italy
and Sweden is mostly fuelled by Somalian nationals.
Istanbul Atatürk remains the top
departure airport of connections
from third countries
In Q2 2016, the number of persons entering the EU/Schengen area from third
countries using fraudulent documents
amounted to 1 600. As in the case of intra-EU/Schengen movements, the number of detections on entry to the EU/
Schengen area from third countries decreased (compared with the previous

quarter) reaching the lowest reported
level since the beginning of 2013. The most
significant declines on these routes were
reported from Morocco to Spain and on
arrival from Turkey. At EU level, of the 98
nationalities detected using fraudulent
documents to illegally enter the EU or
the Schengen area from a third country,
Ukrainians (339), Moroccans (142), Albanians (94) and Iranians (79) were the most
commonly detected. Syrian nationals recorded a further decrease and were only
reported in 52 cases in Q2 2016.
As in previous months, most detections
from third countries were reported from
air routes. With 109 detections, the number of document fraud cases from Istanbul
Atatürk decreased by 9% compared with
the previous quarter. Istanbul Atatürk,
however, still remains the most reported
last departure airport outside the EU/
Schengen area. The continuous decrease

of the overall document fraud detections
was also visible on other main air routes
between third countries and the EU/
Schengen area. The international airport
of Dakar, Senegal remained the second
most reported departure airport outside
the EU/Schengen area.
At land and sea borders, most
detections of document fraud from
Ukraine and Morocco
In the second quarter of 2016, as in previous quarters, the majority of document fraud cases at land borders were
revealed between Ukraine and Poland,
mostly involving Ukrainian nationals. The
Spanish-Moroccan land and sea border
remains the second most reported land
and sea external EU border in Q2 2016
with Moroccans often identifying themselves by presenting fraudulent Spanish
documents.

Corresponding to the decreasing irregular migration pressure on the EU external borders, Member States also reported
fewer cases of illegal stay. Compared with
the previous quarter, the number of illegal stay detections decreased by 12% to
111 874 in Q2 2016. The Member State reporting the largest absolute decrease was
Germany, where the number of reported
detections of illegal stayers fell by 36%.
However, when compared with the rapid
abatement in illegal border-crossings in
the first half of 2016 (-74% between Q1
and Q2), the decline in detections of illegal stay was much slower. As a result, the
number of illegal border-crossings sank to
a lower level than that of detections of illegal stay, returning to the situation in this
regard before Q1 2015.
Moreover, the current number of detections of illegal stay is much higher than the
average in the years before the migration
crisis of 2015. During the second quarter of

14 of 37

2016, Member States reported 14% more
detections of illegal stay than during the
same period of 2014 for example. The average number of detections of illegal stay
during the second quarters between 2008
and 2014 was around 98 000, which is
around 12% below the current level.
Nationalities that are frequently reported
for illegal border-crossing on the Eastern
Mediterranean route are also commonly
detected for illegal stay along the secondary routes to the most popular EU/SAC
destination countries: In Q2 2016, most
detections of Syrian, Afghan, Pakistani,
Iraqi and Palestinian nationals without
permission to stay were reported from
Germany, France, Austria, Bulgaria, Greece
and Hungary. On the other hand, nationalities of irregular migrants typically entering the EU through Italy (e.g. Eritrean
and Nigerian nationals) were most commonly detected for illegal stay in France,
Switzerland, Germany and Italy.

Afghan citizens have been the nationality
with the largest number of detections for
illegal stay for the third quarter in a row,
although their number has been decreasing. More than 13 000 persons or 12% of
all persons detected for illegal stay in Q2
2016 were Afghans. With 6 816 or 6% of all
detections, Syrian nationals were the second largest group among those detected
without permission to stay during the reporting period.
A very significant growth in detections of
illegal stay was reported in relation to nationals of countries in the Horn of Africa.
Member States registered a 132% rise in
nationals of Eritrea, Ethiopia and Somalia compared with the previous quarter,
to 9 137 detections in Q2 2016. This was
mostly due to a large increase reported by
Switzerland, where the number of illegally
staying nationals from these three countries reached the highest number since
FRAN data collection began.

In general, Switzerland was the country which reported the largest absolute
growth in detections of illegal stay. National detections reported under this indicator increased by almost 4 000 between
Q1 and Q2 2016. Together with the 38% decrease in illegal stayers reported by Austria, FRAN data indicate a change in the
routing of irregular secondary movements
from Italy. With intensified controls near
the Brenner Pass to prevent secondary
movements from Italy to Austria, many irregular migrants chose to transit Switzerland to reach their destinations in western
and northern EU countries (see featured
analysis on intra-EU/Schengen secondary movements).

In Q2 2016, Member State authorities issued 73 037 decisions to third country nationals with an obligation to leave the EU
following an administrative or judicial decision. Thus the number of return decisions has increased by 5% compared to
last quarter but decreased by 4% in relation to Q2 2015.
The number of effective returns reported
by Member States has decreased since
last quarter. During the reporting period,
46 445 effective returns took place, which
is 1% less than during the last quarter. Afghan nationals were returned at a significantly higher number, which increased
from 794 effective returns in Q1 2016 to

1 769 during the reference period. The increase was mostly due to more effective
returns implemented by Greece (with Albanians being the top returned nationality). Member States also increased the
number of effectively returned Egyptians,
from 239 to 647.
Number of arrested facilitators
stable
Figures related to detections of facilitators of irregular migration have significantly increased in Q2 2016. Compared
with last quarter, the number of arrested
facilitators grew by 19%, to 3 522 persons.
Italy reported the largest increase in absolute numbers, by almost 600 between
Q1 and Q2 2016.

In the EU/Schengen area

Intra-EU/Schengen irregular
secondary migration flows

n Secondary movements

increasingly difficult to
monitor

n Increase on intra-

Schengen routes
bypassing Austria

Fluctuations in the relative significance of
entry routes across the EU’s external borders and, consequently, control measures
introduced by authorities at the internal
borders between Member States, as well
as pull factors resulting from national policy measures lead to constant changes in
secondary routes of irregular migrants
within the EU and Schengen area.
This featured analysis focuses on four key
geographical gateways to the EU across its
external borders: Central Mediterranean
(feeding into the intra-Schengen Southern) route, Eastern Mediterranean (intraSchengen South-Eastern) route, Western
Mediterranean (intra-Schengen Western)
route and Eastern Borders (intra-Schengen Eastern) route.
Analysis of FRAN data reported by Member States, the intra-Schengen dataset
and the European Union Document-Fraud
(EDF) dataset, as well as qualitative information from Member States and open
sources, revealed a number of changes in
the volume, routes and modi operandi of
secondary movements compared with
Q1 2016.
Southern route: Increasing
importance of Switzerland as a
transit country
Between 24 May 2016 (when the Austria
strengthened controls of its national border with Italy) and the end of August, the
Austrian authorities refused entry to 1 457
migrants1 and arranged for their readmission by Italy. Because of these measures,
many irregular migrants who had arrived

innenpolitik/11936613-91/brenner-kontrollenimmer-wahrscheinlicher.csp

in Italy via the Central Mediterranean Sea
decided to bypass Austria in the attempt
to reach their desired destinations in the
northern EU Member States.
Between the first and the second quarter
of 2016, the number of detections of illegal stay of African migrants (who primarily
enter the EU along the Central Mediterranean route) decreased in Austria (-45%)
and at the same time grew significantly in
Switzerland (+183%). German detections of
irregular migrants from Africa also seem to
confirm this shift. In fact, while the numbers entering Germany from Austria have
slightly diminished, the detections at the
border with Switzerland have increased
more than fourfold between the first and
the second quarter of 2016.
According to open sources, another reason for this shift might be related to the
fact that many migrants who arrived in
Chiasso at the border with Italy are transported to reception centres close to Germany for their asylum application to be
registered. According to Swiss estimates,
more than half of these asylum seekers
absconded and continued their journey
to Germany. 2
France has also been affected by a rising
wave of migrants arriving on secondary
migration routes from Italy. The number
of French Eurodac hits related to a prior
asylum application or illegal border-crossing in Italy doubled compared with the
previous quarter and rose by more than
250% compared with same period of 2015.
The vast majority of these hits were re-

lated to migrants who had arrived along
the Central Mediterranean route.

South-eastern route: Reported
attempts to bypass Austria

There have been several reports of facilitation cases of smuggling migrants across
the Italian-French border in private cars
for a fee. Local media informed that since
the French authorities resumed systematic control at their national border with
Italy on 15 May 2016, several facilitators
have been arrested and convicted for migrant smuggling.3 The fees are reported4
to be around EUR 150 per passenger. In
August, the Italian authorities started to
transfer, by bus, 400 migrants stranded
near the French border in Ventimiglia to
the Identification and Expulsion Centre in
the Italian city of Tarente.5

The decision of the authorities of the
countries along the Western Balkan route
to close their borders for the irregular
migrants who have arrived via the Eastern Mediterranean route and to gradually
withdraw the organised transport through
their territories made it more difficult to
monitor irregular migration within Europe.
In contrast, the large migratory flows of
the late summer and autumn of 2015 were
channelled on one main route, thus the
migrants’ movements were more visible
and quantifiable.

In fact, the current level of intra-Schengen
migration of persons coming on the Eastern Mediterranean and Western Balkan
route is far lower than in 2015 and secondary routes became slightly more diverse.
During the second quarter of 2016, Hungary reported a daily average of about 120
illegal border-crossings from Serbia, which
is a significant decrease from the around
5 000 migrants that transited the West-

By the end of the summer the number of migrants staying in Calais and
surrounding camps was estimated
at around 12 000. At the end of September the French president, François
Hollande, announced that the camp’s
dismantlement would take place in the
following month. The French authorities had also previously announced the
construction of a wall to stop the migrants from disrupting the traffic and
hiding in the lorries heading towards
the UK. The construction of this barrier
indeed started on 20 September. The
dismantlement of the camp started at
the end of October, while work on the
wall was still ongoing. On 4 November, the French Minister of Interior,
Bernard Cazeneuve, announced the
camp had been fully dismantled. According to media reports, 5 132 adults
and 1 932 minors were redistributed to
reception centres all over the French
territory. The minister also stated that
since 17 October, 274 unaccompanied
minors had been transferred to the
UK. At the same time, 3 800 migrants
were also placed in reception centres
in Île-de-France region.

ern Balkans region each day in Q4 2015.
Many of these migrants, after making an
asylum application in Hungary, continued
to travel to Austria and further on to Germany. In fact, Germany reported most detections on intra-Schengen movements
near the Austrian border.
Growing secondary flows from Hungary
to Italy and France
In addition, Member State reports point to
an increasingly important intra-Schengen
route from Hungary via Slovenia and Italy.
Eurodac data show that a growing share of
asylum applicants in Italy was previously
registered in EU Member States along the
Eastern Mediterranean and Western Balkan route. In Q2 2016, Italy reported almost 5 000 Eurodac hits in relation to an
illegal border-crossing or prior asylum application in Hungary, representing a 71%
increase compared to Q1 2016. The reported hits were mainly triggered by Pakistani and Afghan nationals. Moreover,
Eurodac hits in Italy related to Greece
increased by 9%. The reported Eurodac
numbers clearly point to a smaller branch
of the Western Balkan route leading to Italy, probably to avoid the intensified police
controls at the Austrian national borders
with Hungary.
This assumption is supported by the recent disruption of a criminal network operating in several countries. According to
media reports, in August, the authorities
in Italy, Hungary and Slovenia arrested
four people in a coordinated operation
targeting a group suspected of smuggling
irregular migrants into Italy. Two of the
suspects were arrested in northern Italy,
one in Budapest and one in the Slovenian city of Maribor. The suspects were
part of a facilitation network of Pakistani
origin that was based in Milan, the Italian authorities announced to the media.
According to the statement of the Italian authorities, the criminal network received around EUR 500 000 from the
migrants per year. The organisation smuggled nationals of Pakistan, Bangladesh and

erandi was reported from the two main
land entry points from Spain to France,
i.e. Irún and Boulou.

Also intra-Schengen FRAN data reported
by France show an increase in asylum applicants who have previously been fingerprinted in Hungary. In relation to Q1, the
number of Eurodac hits increased by 44%
in the second quarter of 2016. Most migrants who were successively registered
in the Eurodac system in Hungary and
France were of Afghan and Pakistani nationals. It is not clear how many of these
migrants also took the route via Slovenia
and Italy to reach France.

According to Eurodac data, between the
first and the second quarter of 2016, there
was only a slight increase in the number
of hits, on the French territory, regarding
the abovementioned nationals first registered in Spain. This is in line with the upward trend of the total number of Eurodac
hits, in France, from the first to the second quarter. Also in terms of readmissions of migrants from France to Spain,
there was an increase (same nationalities as above) between the first and the
second quarter, also following the rising
trend of the total number of readmissions
from France to Spain.

FRAN intra-Schengen data also point to
many migrants using secondary routes
via the Czech Republic to Germany, thus
bypassing German police controls at the
national border with Austria. After a low
in Q1, the number of irregular migrants
detected in Germany on the route from
the Czech Republic increased again by
one-third.
Western route: Increased secondary
movements but from a comparably
low level
Although detections on the Western Mediterranean route increased by 15% compared with one year ago, there were no
substantial changes on the secondary
routes from Spain and Portugal. Indicators reported to the intra-Schengen dataset point to comparably few secondary
movements between the Iberian Peninsula and France, mainly by nationals of
North and West African countries.
According to open sources, those that
did choose the Western Mediterranean
route and, having arrived in Spain, continued to Central and Northern Europe,
tended to be transported by facilitators
in private cars in return of a fee (around
EUR 250 per passenger). This modus op6

Eastern route
In the second quarter of 2016, the German authorities reported a 37% increase
in detections of intra-Schengen movements from Poland. This rise was mainly
caused by increased numbers of irregular
migrants of Russian nationality who have
entered the EU in Poland after transiting
through Belarus. Many Russian citizens
travel by train from Minsk and enter the
Schengen area in the Polish city of Terespol, where they usually file an asylum
application.
Although Germany reported only few illegally staying Russian nationals in the
intra-Schengen dataset in Q2 2016, the
actual number of irregular migrants travelling between the two countries might
be much higher. In contrast to its border
with Austria, Germany did not reintroduce internal controls at its eastern borders, so the detected number of Russian
irregular migrants travelling from Poland
is relatively low.
Compared with the same period in 2015,
the number of asylum applications submitted by Russian citizens in Poland almost tripled in Q2 2016. Poland also
collects statistics on the ethnicity of the

According to media reports, on 29 August 2016, a group of Russian citizens of
Chechen ethnicity set up a camp in the Belarusian city of Brest, protesting entry
refusals that they had been issued at the Polish border and demanded to speak
to the Polish authorities. The group of Russian citizens included children, women
and elderly people. A local spokesman for the Polish Border Guard confirmed to
the media that the group returned to Belarus after it had been refused entry.

Russian asylum seekers. During the first
seven months of 2016, around 94% of
the Russians who have applied for asy-

lum were of Chechen origin. According to
EASO data, most Russian citizens subsequently left Poland. They then appear to

travel to Germany and reapply for international protection. In fact, the number
of German asylum applications related to
Russian citizens was very similar to that in
Poland, and also tripled in Q2 2016.
French Eurodac hits related to Russian
nationals, of which most result from
prior asylum applications in Poland and
Germany, indicate that the intra-Schengen route continues westwards beyond
Germany.

Returns

Identifying return systems’
vulnerabilities

n Numerous obstacles

on the way to a more
effective return system

n The comparison of

return rates between
Member States
would facilitate the
identification of best
practices and their
exchange among
Member States

In its EU Action Plan on Return , the European Commission clearly stated that return of irregular migrants to their home
countries is an essential part of the EU’s
comprehensive efforts to reduce irregular migration. This link between an effective return policy (or lack thereof)
and irregular migration was also clearly
indicated in the European Agenda on Migration, adopted by the European Commission on 13 May 2015.

migrants or asylum seekers who had arrived in 2015 became subject to return
(due to a failed asylum claim or irregular stay).
This comparison indicates that effective
returns are not very responsive to sharp
increases in irregular migration flows. This
invisible ceiling which prevents the return
numbers from reacting to a major migration crisis as it happened in 2015 may have
several reasons, such as national procedures to process asylum applications and
return decisions, and frequent difficulties
in obtaining the collaboration of the countries of origin in the identification process.

Level of returns nearly unchanged in
spite of migration crisis
One year on, however, it seems that the
overall situation regarding effective returns performed by EU Member States
has not changed significantly. In spite
of the massive irregular movements (of
migrants of nationalities that have high
asylum rejection rates) into the EU, the
number of people effectively removed
from the EU remained flat with a monthly
average of around 15 000 (between May
2015 and July 2016). In fact, the monthly
figures did not show any rising trend at
the beginning of 2016 when many of the

Apart from gaps in Member States’ regulations and legislative frameworks, returns are slowed down by numerous
practical challenges, in particular the
difficulties in obtaining adequate travel
documents from the authorities of the
origin countries. Return agreements
between Member States and countries of origin are an important condition for intensifying returns, but they
also require an effective implementa-

tion. The non-cooperation of countries
of origin remains a major problem and
some Member States have developed
strategies and operational measures to
deal with the obstacles posed by certain
countries of origin. Among the best practices shared by some Member States are
task forces and cross-departmental cooperation frameworks, as well as practical initiatives with partner countries,
such as the European Integrated Return
Management Initiative (EURINT).
Development of solutions to improve
the return system requires time
Another effective practice are identification missions, involving country of or-

igin officials staying in Member States
and issuing the necessary documentation to returnees of their own nationality on the spot. Again, in this context,
the joining of forces between Member
States when dealing with countries of
origin is indispensable for encouraging
them to readmit their nationals. For this
reason, some Member States/Schengen
Associated Countries are sharing identification missions.
Towards an indicator forecasting
return priorities
A common element of all the mentioned
solutions is that they demand a large
amount of lead time for their planning

and practical implementation. An early
warning indicator forecasting upcoming
return priorities would help to start the
necessary preparatory work to deepen
cooperation with countries of origin in
due time and to improving the related
operational infrastructure and regulatory
framework. This indicator would need to
take into account not only the number
of migrants from a specific third country but also additional aspects, such as
the overall rejection rate of asylum applications, rates of explicit and implicit
withdrawals of asylum procedure, the
number of return decisions and effective returns.

Sources and Methods
For the data concerning detections at the
external borders, some of the border types
are not applicable to all FRAN Member
States. This pertains to data on all FRAN
indicators since the data are provided disaggregated by border type. The definitions
of detections at land borders are therefore not applicable (excluding borders with
non-Schengen principalities) for Belgium,
the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg,
Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden,
Switzerland and the UK. For Cyprus, the
land border refers to the Green Line demarcation with the area not under the effective control of the government of the
Republic of Cyprus. For sea borders, the
definitions are not applicable for landlocked Member States including Austria,
the Czech Republic, Hungary, Luxembourg,
Slovakia and Switzerland.
In addition, data on detections of illegal
border-crossing at land, air and sea BCPs
(1B) are not available for Iceland, Ireland
and Spain and in Greece (these detections
are included in the data for Indicator 1A).
Data for Norway only includes detections
of illegal border-crossing at land and sea
BCPs (1B), not between BCPs (1A).
Data on detections of illegal border-crossing between sea BCPs (1A) are not available for Ireland.

Data on apprehension (FRAN Indicator 2)
of facilitators is not available for Ireland.
For Italy, the data are not disaggregated
by border type, but are reported as total
apprehensions (not specified). Data for Italy and Norway also include the facilitation
of illegal stay and work. For Romania, the
data include land intra-EU detections on
exit at the border with Hungary.
For the data concerning detections of illegal stay (FRAN Indicator 3), data for Austria for June 2016 are not available, data
on detections on exit are not available for
Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Spain and the UK.
Data on refusals of entry (FRAN Indicator 4) at the external EU borders are not
disaggregated by reason of refusal for Ireland and the UK. Refusals of entry at the
Spanish land borders at Ceuta and Melilla
(without the issuance of a refusal form) are
reported separately and are not included
in the presented FRAN data.
The data on applications for international
protection (FRAN Indicator 5) are not disaggregated by place of application (type of
border on entry or inland applications) for
Austria, the Czech Republic and Slovenia.
For these countries, only the total number
of applications is reported. For France, only
asylum applications at the external borders are reported, not inland applications.
For the UK, data reported for applications

at air BCPs also include applications at sea
BCPs. Data for Austria are not yet available from December 2015 until June 2016.
The data on return decisions issued (FRAN
Indicator 7A) are not available for Ireland,
France, the Netherlands and Sweden. The
data on effective returns (FRAN Indicator 7B) are not available for Ireland. In addition, the data of effective returns are not
disaggregated by return operation (voluntary and forced) for Spain. The data on
voluntary effective returns (FRAN Indicator 7A) are not disaggregated by type of return operation (IOM-assisted and others)
for Belgium, the Czech Republic, Finland
and the Netherlands. The data on forced
effective returns (FRAN Indicator 7A) are
not disaggregated by type of return operation (enforced by Member Stated and
by Joint Operations) for Belgium, Finland,
Iceland and the Netherlands. For Indicator 7A, data for Belgium are not available
for June 2016 and data for Sweden up to
May 2016 are note available. For Indicator
7B, data for Austria are not available since
October 2015.
