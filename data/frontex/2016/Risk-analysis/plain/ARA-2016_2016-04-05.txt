Frontex official publications fall into four main categories: risk analysis, training, operations and research,
each marked with a distinct graphic identifier. Risk analysis publications bear a triangular symbol formed
by an arrow drawing a triangle, with a dot at the centre. Meta­phorically, the arrow represents the cyclical
nature of risk analysis processes and its orienta­tion towards an appropriate operational response. The tri­
angle is a symbol of ideal proportions and knowledge, reflecting the pursuit of factual exactness, truth and
exhaustive analysis. The dot at the centre represents the intelligence factor and the focal point where informa­
tion from diverse sources converges to be processed, systematised and shared as analytical products. Thus,
Frontex risk analysis is meant to be at the centre and to form a reliable ba­sis for its operational activities.

The year 2015 was unprecedented for the
EU and its external borders, with 1.8 mil­
lion detections of illegal entries asso­
ciated with an estimated one million
individuals. Unlike almost any other
year since World War II, the scenes of
chaos and the tragic images of those who
have lost their lives have sharpened the
focus on migration issues.
Given the proximity of conflict areas
and the persistent economic disparity
between the EU and many countries of

Coast Guard – designed to meet the new
challenges and political realities faced by
the EU, with regard to both migration
and internal security. According to the
proposal, the European Border and Coast
Guard should be composed of the Euro­
pean Border and Coast Guard Agency and
the national authorities and coastguards
responsible for border management.
I encourage all Member States to sup­
port the core elements of this proposal
and swiftly conduct the work ahead for

origin, many would-be migrants will
remain motivated to depart towards
the EU.
It can be a challenge to provide for the
continuous functioning of border-control
activities in a situation where thousands
of migrants of mixed backgrounds, cir­
cumstances and nationalities arrive at
the border in a very short space of time.
Ensuring the rescue, safety, registration
and identification of thousands of vul­
nerable individuals is an extremely on­
erous task and one that implies a certain
level of inherent risk and vulnerability
at the external borders.
In response to the varying locations
and the scale of the threats witnessed,
the authorities at the borders must have
a capability for risk mitigation at the
time of emergency. Often the response
calls for intensified interagency cooper­
ation. This is an important tool for re­
sponding when a particular border is
under an extensive strain.
The already difficult problem of irreg­
ular migration was rendered even more
complex by the tragic attacks in Paris in
November 2015 and the growing threat
from foreign terrorist fighters. This was
a dreadful reminder that border man­
agement also has an important secu­
rity component. It demonstrates that all
Member States, be they of entry, transit
or destination, are bound by the links of
shared responsibility. This responsibility
calls for initiatives that unite.
The European Commission is propos­
ing to establish a European Border and

its implementation. This ambitious pro­
posal relates not only to the management
of the external borders, but furthermore
– and let’s make no mistake about it –
to the preservation of free movement
within the Schengen area.
At the onset of 2016, the Agency has
received additional funding and staff.
Risk analysis, like the one presented in
this report, is an essential tool for decid­
ing how these new resources should be
allocated. One of the most pressing chal­
lenges for border guards is clear: how to
distinguish legitimate asylum seekers
who arrive at the external border with no
papers from individuals posing a security
threat and economic migrants attempt­
ing to abuse the system by claiming a
false nationality? This difficulty is exacer­
bated in situations of intense migratory
pressure. It is clear that in response to
these challenges, greater emphasis must
be placed on increased screening, regis­
tration and debriefing activities. Moreo­
ver, let me reiterate that Frontex urgently
needs to be given access to SIS, VIS, Eu­
rodac, Europol and Interpol databases
which are relevant for border checks.
This report also shows that efforts
should be pursued urgently in the area
of returns. Indeed, one of the incentives
for irregular migrants is the knowledge
that the EU’s return system – meant to
return irregular migrants or those whose
asylum applications have been refused –
works imperfectly.
Operations against criminals involved
in migrant smuggling can be sharpened

1. Preface

by actionable intelligence. We need to
invest in knowledge, information shar­
ing and cooperation. We are advancing
in that direction with the proposal to
set up in Frontex a risk analysis centre
with the capacity to carry out risk anal­
ysis covering all aspects of integrated
border management. Moreover, facili­
tating the exchange of information with
Member States, the European Asylum
Support Office, Europol or Eurojust will
be at the heart of Frontex processing of
personal data.
Finally, irregular migration is a very
dynamic and complex phenomenon,
drivers of which can change rapidly and
unexpectedly. Basing future analyses
merely on trend analysis or environmen­
tal scans will no longer be effective or ad­
equate. The Risk Analysis for 2016 describes
a series of alternative future scenarios
developed in collaboration with experts
from relevant organisations. I encourage
all stakeholders to make use of them as a
foresight instrument at a strategic level.

2. Summary
In 2015, Mem­ber States reported more
than 1 820 000 detections of illegal bor­
der-crossing along the external borders.
This never-before-seen figure was more
than six times the number of detections
reported in 2014, which was itself an un­
precedented year, with record monthly
averages observed since April 2014.
The year 2015 began with extremely
high levels for the month of Jan­uary
(over 20 000 detections, against the
2009–2014 January average of 4 700 de­
tections), and each subsequent month
set a new monthly record. In July, a turn­
ing point was reached with more than
100 000 detections, coinciding with a
change in the law in the former Yugo­
slav Republic of Macedonia allow­ing mi­
grants to legalise their stay for a 72-hour
period after they express a wish to ap­
ply for inter­national protection. It re­
sulted in a further increase of the flow
and throughout the sum­mer months
scenes of chaos from the border areas
spoke of a situa­tion that appeared out
of control. In Sep­tember, public bus and
train services were requisitioned in West­
ern Balkan countries and in some Mem­
ber States to transport migrants, but the
flow continued to grow until October. As
of No­vember, the situation eased a little,
but the EU’s total for December, at over
220 000 detec­tions, was still way above
the figure for the entire 2013.
There is no EU system capable of trac­
ing people’s movements following an il­
legal border-crossing. Therefore it is not
pos­sible to establish the precise number
of persons who have illegally crossed two
sections of the external borders of the
EU. Only an estimate of about 1 000 000
persons can be provided, based on the

6 of 72
Frontex · Risk Analysis for 2016

assumption that all migrants first de­
tected irregularly crossing in Greece were
then detected for a second time re-enter­
ing the EU from the Western Balkans.
The largest number of detections was
re­ported on the Eastern Mediterranean
route (885 386), mostly between Turkey
and the Greek islands in the Eastern Ae­
gean Sea. However, few applied for asy­
lum in Greece and instead crossed the
border to the former Yugoslav Republic
of Macedonia and continued through the
Western Balkans, initially towards the
Hungar­ian border with Serbia, where
they applied for asylum, and then to
their final destinations in the EU. As
of mid-September, the flow shifted to­
wards the Croatian bor­der with Serbia,
following the construction of a tempo­
rary technical obstacle in Hungary and
the establishment of transit areas for
immediate processing of asylum appli­
cants with the possibility of return to
Serbia.
In contrast, on the Central Mediterranean route, the number of detec­
tions of illegal border-crossing was about
154 000, a slight decrease compared to
the previous year, but this figure was still
higher than total detections recorded for
the entire EU in 2011, i.e. the year of the
Arab Spring (141 051). The decrease was
due to a lower number of Syrians (about
40 000 in 2014, and 7 448 in 2015), who
seemed to have shifted to the Eastern
Mediterranean route.
On the Western Mediterranean
route, the cooperation between Spain
and Mo­rocco is key in maintaining detec­
tions on the land route between the two
countries at a relatively low level. As a re­
sult, sub-Sa­haran migrants, who tended

to make a sea crossing to Spain, now in­
creasingly opt for departing from Libya.
On the Western African route, which
con­nects Senegal, Mauritania and Mo­
rocco with the Spanish Canary Islands af­
ter a treacherous journey on the Atlantic
Ocean, the numbers remain negligible
despite an increasing trend of departures
from Morocco. This low number is attrib­
uted to the joint surveillance ac­tivities
and effective return of those detected
crossing the border illegally.
On the Eastern land bor­der, a new
route emerged in 2015 at the land bor­
ders of Norway and Finland with the
Russian Federation (the so-called Arctic
route). The main tar­geted border cross­
ing point (BCP) was the Norwegian BCP
of Storskog, which regis­tered an unu­
sually high num­ber of applications for
asylum in 2015 (over 5 200). The sit­uation
in Norway eased in December, when the
Russian Federa­tion resumed its practice
of preventing the exit of travel­lers with­

© Frontex

out a travel document that would allow
them to enter the EU. However, at the
onset of 2016, the situation remains a
concern in Finland, though with fewer
cases than in Norway so far.
Those declaring to hail from Syria
(594 059) and Afghanistan (267 485) rep­
resented the highest share of detections
of illegal border-crossing on entry to the
EU in 2015. While Syrians undeni­ably
constitute the largest proportion, their
exact number is diffi­cult to establish due
to the fact that many other mi­grants
also claim to be from Syria in order to
accelerate their travel. Establishing the
identity of a large number of poorly doc­
umented migrants is one of the main
challenges border-control authorities
are confronted with.
Since 2014, the number of detected
West Africans has been steadily increas­
ing, to reach over 64 000 de­tections in
2015, of whom nearly 85% on the Central
Mediterranean route. In contrast to East

Af­ricans, who tend to apply for asylum
in other Member States, West Af­ricans
apply for asylum in Italy and in fact ac­
count for the largest share of asylum ap­
plicants in this country.
While Greece and Italy have been un­
der particularly intense pressure as the
two main entry points reporting several
thousand arrivals per day, the large-scale
inflows of migrants have been a new ex­
perience for several other Member States.
The main challenges include the widen­
ing of the surveillance areas, the grow­
ing need for and the extension of search
and rescue operations, the lack of facil­
ities to receive and accommodate thou­
sands of persons over a short time, the
lack of expertise to detect non-typical
travel documents, difficulties in address­
ing fraudulent declarations of nation­
ality or age, and non-systematic entry
of fingerprints to the Eurodac. Last but
not least, the process of registration at
the borders should more thoroughly

take into account the risks to internal
security.
The Paris attacks in November 2015
clearly demonstrated that irregular mi­
gratory flows could be used by terrorists
to enter the EU. Two of the terrorists in­
volved in the attacks had previously ir­
regularly entered through Leros and had
been registered by the Greek authori­
ties. They presented fraudulent Syrian
documents to speed up their registra­
tion process.
As the vast majority of migrants ar­
rive undocumented, screening activities
are essential to properly verify their dec­
laration of nationality. False declarations
of nationality are rife among nationals
who are unlikely to obtain asylum in
the EU, are liable to be returned to their
country of origin or transit, or just want
to speed up their journey. With a large
number of persons arriving with false
or no identification documents or rais­
ing concerns over the validity of their

7 of 72
FRONTEX · Risk Analysis for 2016

claimed nationality – with no thorough
check or penalties in place for those mak­
ing such false declarations, there is a risk
that some persons representing a secu­
rity threat to the EU may be taking ad­
vantage of this situation.
The unprecedented number of detec­
tions of illegal border-crossing has also
led to a surge in violent incidents along
the EU’s external borders. People smug­
glers, motivated by profit, increasingly
put migrants’ lives at risk and even
threaten border guards to re­cover boats
or escape apprehension. Also, situations
when a large number of people are cross­

of bodies recov­ered during Joint Opera­
tions. In 2015, 470 dead bodies were re­
ported in the Mediter­ranean area, an
increase of 112% compared to 2014. Ac­
cording to IOM estimates, more than
3 770 persons went missing or died in
the Mediterranean area in 2015.
In spite of the popular perception that
mass migration may pose a threat of
the spread of infectious diseases, WHO
‘Pub­lic Health Aspects of Migration in
Europe’ (PHAME) indicates that there
is no evi­dence to suggest such connec­
tion. Refugees and migrants are mainly
exposed to the infec­tious diseases that

the area of returns. Indeed, in its Eu­
ropean Agenda on Migration, the Com­
mission states that ‘one of the incentives
for irregular migrants is the knowledge
that the EU’s return system – meant to
return irregular migrants or those whose
asylum applications have been refused –
works imperfectly.’
Frontex has created scenarios to
form a basis for an annual monitor­
ing of changes in the environment in
which the Agency operates. Very differ­
ent stakeholders can make use of these
scenarios to develop their own internal
strategies or monitor how these strate­

ing the border en masse have led to vio­
lence requiring public order policing,
a task for which border-control author­
ities are neither adequately equipped
nor trained.
It is dauntingly difficult to estimate
fatal­ities among migrants irregularly
crossing the border because it is not pos­
sible to keep an accurate tally of missing
persons. Frontex does not record these
data and can only report the number

are common in Europe, independently
of migration. The risk that exotic infec­
tious agents will be brought to Europe
is extremely low.
In a situation of continued pressure
on the EU’s external borders, it is pre­
sumed that these challenges will be best
addressed in a co­ordinated manner, re­
quiring harmonised application of leg­
islation and pooling of resources. In
addition, efforts should be pursued in

gies fit into a changing environment.
Seven scenarios are outlined in the pre­
sent report, spanning a large variety of
possible futures.

3. Introduction
The Frontex Risk Analysis for 2016 has been
developed for decision-makers to make
informed decisions on common and con­
certed actions that are most likely to have
sustainable effects on the management
of the external borders and ul­timately on
the internal security of the EU.
Frontex operational activities aim
to strengthen border security by en­
suring the coordination of Member
States’ actions in the implementation
of Community measures relating to the
management of the external borders. The
coordination of operational ac­tivities also
contributes to better allocation of Mem­
ber States’ resources and protection of
the area of freedom, security and justice.
The Risk Analysis for 2016 concentrates on
the current scope of Frontex operational
activities, which focus on irregular mi­

gration at the external borders of the
EU and Schengen Asso­ciated Countries.
Central to the concept of integrated bor­
der management (IBM), bor­der manage­
ment should also cover secu­rity threats
present at the external borders.
This annual analysis is developed in
the fol­lowing sequence: (1) description
of the sit­uation by utilising a range of
indicators on irregular migration as ex­
changed among Member States; (2) fea­
tured analyses representing the current
key risks identified at the external bor­
ders; (3) scenarios aimed at preparing
the management of the external bor­
ders to face a range of situations in the
coming years.
The Frontex Risk Analysis Unit (RAU)
would like to express its gratitude to all
members of the Frontex Risk Analysis

Network (FRAN) in Member States for
their efforts in provid­ing data and infor­
mation, as well as Europol, the European
Asylum Support Office (EASO), the Fun­
damental Right Agency (FRA), the Com­
mission, the European External Action
Service (EEAS), EU Intelligence Analysis
Centre (INTCEN), UNHCR, OECD Inter­
national Migration Division, WHO and
all Frontex colleagues involved in the
prepa­ration of this report.

4. Methodology
A coherent and comprehensive analy­
sis of the risks affect­ing security at the
external borders requires, above all, the
adoption of common indica­tors. Consist­
ent monitoring of these indica­tors will
allow effective measures to be taken on
the ground. The analysis will need to
identify the risks that arise at the exter­
nal borders themselves and those that
arise in third countries.
The backbone of the Risk Analysis for
2016 is the monthly statistics exchanged
among Member States within the frame­
work of the FRAN. For the Risk Analysis for
2016, the key indi­cators collected through
the FRAN were: detec­tions of illegal bor­
der-crossing through the green border
or at BCPs; refusals of entry; de­tections
of illegal stay; detections of facilita­tors;
detections of fraudulent documents; re­

turn decisions; effective returns; and
passen­ger flow (when available). Data
on asylum applications are still being
collected within the FRAN, but increas­
ingly Frontex relies on data collected by
EASO that contributed to the dedicated
section on asylum.
The data were categorised by border
type (land, air, and sea) and those on
land borders were additionally catego­
rised by border section with neighbour­
ing third countries. The data exchanged
within the FRAN are compiled and an­
alysed on a quarterly ba­sis. Priority is
given to the use of the data for manage­
ment purposes and to their fast sharing
among Member State border-con­trol au­
thorities. Member States’ data that are
processed by Frontex are not treated as
official statistics, and thus may occa­

sionally vary from those officially pub­
lished by na­tional authorities.
Throughout 2015, some FRAN mem­
bers per­formed backdated updates of
their 2014 statis­tics. These updates have
been accounted for in this document and
so some data presented here may differ
from the data presented a year ago in
the 2015 Annual Risk Analysis.
Member States were not requested to
an­swer specific questions in support of
this analysis. Rather, bi-monthly ana­
lytical re­ports were important sources
of information, es­pecially as regards the
analysis of routes and modi operandi.
Open-source information was also ef­
fectively exploited, especially in identi­
fying the main push and pull factors for
irregular migration to the EU. Among
others, these sources included reports
issued by government agencies, interna­
tional and non-governmental organisa­
tions, as well as mainstream news
agencies and official EU reports, such

as the European Commission’s reports
on third countries.
For the development of the scenarios,
the services of an external company, Sce­
nario Management International (ScMI),
were used. A computer-aided scenario
method has been designed by ScMI to
assist in the computation and selection
among millions of combinations, as
set of relevant possible futures. About
twenty experts participated in the devel­
opment of these scenarios, half of them
from various Frontex units, and the oth­
ers half experts delegated by Member
States (Finland, Germany, Greece, the
Netherlands) Europol, EASO, FRA, the
Commission, EEAS, EU INTCEN, UNHCR
and OECD migration division.
External borders refer to the borders
be­tween Member States and third coun­
tries. The borders between the Schen­
gen Associ­ated Countries (Norway,
Iceland, and Switzer­land) and third
countries are also considered as exter­
nal borders. The borders between the

Schengen Associated Countries and
Schen­gen Member States are consid­
ered as internal borders. For the indica­
tors on detections of facilitators, illegal
stay and asylum, statistics are also re­
ported for detections at the land bor­
ders between Schengen Member States
and those Member States that have ei­
ther not joined the Schengen area yet
(Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Romania) or
have opted to stay out of it (the UK, Ire­
land). Thus, a total for Member States
and Schengen Associated Countries as
a whole can be presented. It was not
possible to make this distinction for air
and sea borders because Member States
do not habitually differentiate between
extra-EU and intra-EU air and sea con­
nections but tend to aggregate data for
all arrivals per airport.
Consistent with other law-enforce­
ment indi­cators, variation in admin­
istrative data related to border control
depends on several factors. In this case,
the number of detections of ille­gal bor­

der-crossing and refusals of entry are
both functions of the amount of effort
spent detecting migrants and the ac­
tual flow of ir­regular migrants to the
EU. For example, in­creased detections
of illegal border-crossing might be due
to a real increase in the flow of irregu­
lar migrants, or may in fact be an out­
come of more resources made available
to detect migrants. In exceptional cases,
in­creased resources may produce a rise
in re­ported detections while effectively
masking the actual decrease in the flow
of migrants, resulting from a strong de­
terrent effect.

5. Situational picture in 2015

5.1. Main trends
The year 2015 was marked by an unprec­
edented number of detections of illegal
border-crossing between BCPs, revealing
a migration crisis without equivalent in
Europe since World War II. There were
three choke-points: the maritime border
between Turkey and Greece, the Central
Mediterranean border and, as a conse­
quence of the entry through Greece, the
border with Western Balkan countries.
The situation is described in detail in
subsequent chapters.
Despite this crisis situation at the bor­
ders in Southern Europe, most of the
workload of border-control authorities
at EU level continues to be directed to­
wards checking the regular flow of pas­
sengers. This regular flow is constantly
increasing, mostly at the land borders,
due to the visa liberalisation policy and

ular migrants between BCPs (an area of­
ten referred to as the green border, from
where detections of illegal border-cross­
ing are reported), rather than through
BCPs, where passengers not meeting the
requirements for entry will be refused.
Overall, the ratio of refusals of entry
per 100 000 passengers is higher at the
land than at the air border, revealing
the very different nature of the flows at
these border types. The large differences
in refusal rates among Member States
also suggest differences in flows of pas­
sengers arriving through Member States.
Among regular passengers, the num­
ber of persons detected using fraudulent
documents, mostly at airports remained
at a very low level (fewer than 9 000 de­
tections on entry from third countries)
despite large movements across the bor­

local border traffic agreements and at air
borders, following a general increase in
the number of air passengers worldwide.
According to Eurostat, extra-EU air ar­
rivals rose by 6% between 2013 and 2014.1
The increase could partly be linked with
the rising number of passengers transit­
ing through the Middle East region, in
particular Dubai and Doha airports, be­
fore arriving in the EU.
The regular flow of passengers is com­
posed of EU nationals, as well as thirdcountry nationals not requiring a visa
and those requiring one. By contrast to
the first two flows, the number of shortterm Schengen visas issued decreased be­
tween 2013 and 2014, following a sharp
fall in the number of visas issued in the
Russian Federation and Ukraine in the
wake of the economic crisis. However, ex­
cluding these two countries, the number
of visas issued increased by 11%, reflecting
growing mobility worldwide and the at­
tractiveness of the EU for many travellers.
The number of refusals of entry at bor­
der crossing points (BCPs), as defined in
the Schengen Borders Code, remained
relatively stable between 2014 and 2015
(118 495 in 2015 and 114 887 in 2014). This
is a very low level, considering the in­
creasing migratory pressure, as well as
the very large number of regular pas­
sengers (several million per year), but it
reflects facilitators’ choice to direct irreg­

ders. The results and observations col­
lected during an exercise carried out
under Frontex umbrella highlighted a
series of vulnerabilities in the travel doc­
ument inspection process. This points to
the risk for detections of document fraud
to underestimate the actual number of
persons entering the EU upon presen­
tation of fraudulent travel documents.
Within the EU, the number of asylum
applications and the number of detec­
tions of illegal stay rose to unprecedented
levels, over 1.35 million. These increases
are directly connected with the arrivals
at the external borders.
The number of return decisions (is­
sued by authorities other than bordercontrol authorities) and the number
of effective returns (usually im­
plemented by border-control
authorities) remained rel­
atively stable. There is a
striking difference be­
tween the nation­
alities detected
crossing the bor­
der illegally or
staying illegally
in the EU, and
the nationalities
effectively re­
turned. Indeed,
most people de­
tected crossing
the border illegally
travelled within the EU
and then applied for asy­
lum and thus were not returned.

Persons who are likely to be found staying illegally
in the EU, mostly by overstaying a regular entry
or not being detected at the border: The main chal­
lenges here are to increase the detection of those en­
tering clandestinely, for example hidden in vehicles,
and to refuse entry to those who are likely to overstay
their legal period of stay. This can only be done by in­
creased collaboration with police authorities inland
and the joint analysis of the profile of vehicles and
persons crossing the border illegally. Prompt and har­
monised return policies among Member States are es­
sential to avoid migrants deciding to stay in Member
States where the likelihood of return is low. This flow
mostly corresponds to flows at BCPs, where bordercontrol authorities perform checks.

Asylum applications in a Member State different
than the Member State of entry and unlikely to receive a positive asylum decision: Here, the first chal­
lenge is to detect those crossing illegally between BCPs
and rapidly identify those likely to apply for asylum
in other Member States. The second and most diffi­
cult challenge is to identify among the large flow of
bona fide travellers those who will eventually apply
for asylum. Finally, border-control authorities are also
involved in implementing the return of those who re­
ceived a negative decision on their asylum application.
The challenge here is to increase the ratio between re­
turn decisions and effective returns in line with the
EU return policy.

no torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or pun­

Search and rescue operations were
crucial in saving the lives of an unprec­
edented number of migrants. However,
it is on this route that the largest death
toll was reported among migrants cross­
ing the border illegally. IOM estimates
that around 3 770 persons went missing
or died at sea in 2015.
On the other traditional routes, the
situation remained comparable to previ­
ous years, with 7 164 detections reported
from the Western Mediterranean route
(-1% compared to 2014), 8 932 on the cir­

In contrast, the Central Mediterra­
nean route saw the number of people
crossing to Italy decreasing by about 10%
in 2015. This was in large part due to a
decrease in the number of Syrians opting
for this route, as the majority preferred
the shorter Eastern Mediterranean route,
bringing the figure down to 153 946 com­
pared with approximately 170 000 in the
same period of 2014. Mostly Africans,
from Eritrea and West Africa, were re­
ported on this route, and their detections
increased compared to 2014.

Syria

Surveillance consists in the activities of
border-control authorities carried out be­
tween BCPs. During these surveillance
activities, in 2015, more than 1 820 000
detections of illegal border-crossing
along the EU external borders were re­
ported, i.e. six times more than in 2014.
Throughout 2015 and in particular dur­
ing the summer, not only inflows surged
but the routes used by asylum seekers
also changed.
On the Eastern Mediterranean route,
most detections (872 938) corresponded to
the arrivals on the Greek islands of the
Aegean Sea. Syrians accounted for the
largest proportion of arrivals, although
towards the end of the year, the share of
Afghan nationals has risen significantly.
A total of 764 038 detections were re­
corded on the Western Balkan route,
mainly on Hungary’s and Croatia’s bor­
ders with Serbia. Most of the migrants
had earlier arrived on one of the Greek
islands and then left the EU to travel
through the former Yugoslav Republic
of Macedonia and Serbia. After Hungary
constructed a temporary technical obsta­
cle along its border with Serbia and tight­
ened border controls in September, the
migrants have begun crossing Croatia’s
border with Serbia in record numbers.

and Greece, and 68 in the Black Sea.
Detections associated with surveil­
lance activities on the eastern land bor­
der remained at relatively low levels
(1 920), but an unusual increase in un­
founded asylum applications at BCPs
was reported at the Norwegian and Finn­
ish borders with the Russian Federation
(the Arctic route). On this route, start­
ing from September 2015, an increasing
number of migrants, in particular from
Afghanistan and Syria, were reported
crossing the border without proper doc­
uments and then applying for asylum.
Citizens from Syria and Afghanistan
repre­sented the highest share of detec­
tions of illegal border-crossing in 2015.
The vast majority arrived from Turkey in
Greece, and only approximately 7 448 Syr­
ians and 117 Afghans were reported on the
Central Mediterranean route. The break­
down by nationality, however, should be
considered with caution as thorough in­
terviews of a proportion of migrants dur­
ing the screening procedure indicated a
high degree of falsely claimed nationali­
ties. Indeed, many migrants claimed to be
from Syria or Afghanistan, to avoid being
returned to Turkey or their country of ori­
gin, and so speed up their journey within
the EU. Establishing the identity of a large
number of poorly documented migrants is
one of the main challenges border-control
authorities are confronted with.
Eritreans ranked first in terms of the
nationalities of migrants arriving on the
Central Mediterranean route, with 38 791
detections, or 25% of this route’s total.
However, as regards regional totals, West
Africans (54 828) represented the largest
share of migrants arriving on this route.
The unprecedented number of detec­
tions of illegal border-crossing also meant
that in several Member States, the author­
ities were not able to register the nation­
ality of the persons arriving. Thus, the
category ‘not specified’ for illegal bordercrossing represented 30% of the total. Most
of the cases under this category were re­
ported after mid-September 2015, when the
flow of migrants entered through Croatia.
Since 2014, the number of detections
of West Africans has been steadily in­
creasing, to reach 64 169 detections in
2015, nearly 86% of which on the Central
Mediterranean route. While this number
pales in comparison to the record annual
total, this is a growing trend that needs

5.3. Surveillance: Eastern Mediterranean
The largest number of detections was
reported on the Eastern Mediterranean
route (885 386), mostly between Turkey
and the Greek islands in the Eastern Ae­
gean Sea. However, few applied for asy­
lum in Greece and instead left Greece
across the border with the former Yu­
goslav Republic of Macedonia and con­
tinued through the Western Balkans.

cluding that of a three-year-old boy near
Bodrum, Turkey.
Most persons illegally crossing the
border in the Aegean Sea were Syrians
and Afghans. Many travelled in family
units, which meant that many mi­grants
belonged to vulnerable groups requiring
special attention.

The breakdown by nationality should
be considered with caution as thorough
interviews of a proportion of the mi­
grants during screening procedure re­
vealed a high degree of falsely claimed
nationalities.
The vast majority of migrants do not
apply for asylum in Greece. Syrian mi­
grants receive special authorisation to
stay in Greece for up to six months and
many use this authori­sation to travel
through the country to the border with
the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedo­
nia, and then continue through the West­
ern Balkans to other EU Member States.

Land border
At the land border, detections of il­
legal border-crossing increased by 80%
between 2014 and 2105. Detections were
twice as high at the Bulgarian land bor­
der with Turkey as at the neighbouring
Greek land border. However, the gap nar­
rowed after September 2015, coinciding
with the transportation measures set up
from the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia border, rendering the journey
through the Greek Thrace region more at­
tractive than the journey through Bul­
garia and then Serbia.
The composition of the flow was
roughly similar to the flow of migrants
crossing the Aegean Sea, with the top
three nationalities being Syrian, Afghan
and Iraqi.

Most detections were reported from the
islands of Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros
and Kos, though the number of islands
targeted by the smuggling groups is
growing. As resources at the border are
increasingly stretched in order to attend
to unprecedented numbers of arrivals,
it is also more likely that an unknown
number of mi­grants cross undetected.
With the rapid increase in the num­
ber of migrants seeking facilitation,
smugglers are becoming more and more
aggressive and ruthless to increase their
profit, forcing migrants to board already
overcrowded boats. Such behaviour led
to lives being lost in the Ae­gean Sea, in­

5.4. Surveillance: Western Balkans
In 2015, 766 038 detections of illegal bor­
der-crossing were reported from the bor­
ders with Western Balkan countries.
Between January and February, most
of the detections concerned persons
from Kosovo*, i.e. a regional flow. As
of March, detections were associated
with non-regional flow of migrants who
had initially crossed illegally from Tur­
key to Greece and on their way to West­
ern Europe, mostly Germany.
Detections of non-regional migrants
dramatically increased in July as a result
of the increase in arrivals in Greece af­
ter April 2015. This increase also coin­
cided with the amendments made to
the Asylum Law of the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia that allowed for
a 72-hour period of legal transit and ac­
cess to public transportation, with the
measures announced by the Hungarian
government aimed at curbing the irreg­
ular migratory flow entering from Ser­
bia, and with a declaration in Germany
that there was ‘no upper limit to the
right for asylum’.
As a consequence of the continued
pressure, Hungary constructed a tempo­
rary technical obstacle along its border

with Serbia, which was completed in
mid-September 2015. This resulted in a
sharp decrease of detections, and con­
fined the flow of migrants at BCPs. Mi­
grants applying for asylum at Hungarian
BCPs would be returned to Serbia, con­
sidered as a safe country. The main flow
of migrants thus quickly moved to the
Croatian-Serbian land border, at a daily
average of over 6 400 between mid-Sep­
tember and the end of October. Once
in Croatia, migrants were transported
by trains towards the border with Hun­
gary. Hence, Hungary extended its con­
struction to its land border with Croatia,
thus moving the flow towards Slovenia
as of mid-October.
The main reported nationalities were
Syrians and Afghans. However, the large
number of migrants made it impossi­
ble for the authorities to identify all of
them, leading to a massive increase in
the proportion of migrants whose coun­
try of origin is reported as unknown.
Although various prevention meas­
ures were attempted (i.e. the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia tried
to close the border with Greece, Ser­
bia deployed additional personnel and

equipment), the authorities in the West­
ern Balkans, like their EU neighbours,
could not contain the large number of
migrants arriving. In reaction to pub­
lic secu­rity concerns, the authorities of
the former Yugoslav Republic of Mace­
donia and Serbia focused their efforts
on transporting migrants by trains and
buses towards the next border in order
to facilitate their exit. Only a fraction of
the migrants were screened and finger­
printed as would normally be the case.
Kosovo*, being the only Western Bal­
kan country that has not signed a visa
liberalisation agreement, remains the
main regional source of migrants cross­
ing the border illegally. Their detections
at the Hungarian-Serbian borders started
to grow in August 2014, reached a peak in
February 2015 and dropped afterwards,
following the introduction of concerted
international countermeasures. Their
numbers have remained very low since
then.
An increasing number of Albanians
travelled legally to EU Member States,
mostly Germany, where they applied for
asylum. The increase started in January
2015 and peaked in August 2015. Accord­
ing to EASO, the rejection rate for asylum
applications of Albanians between Janu­
ary and July 2015 was 96% at EU level. Or­
ganising the return of those not granted
asylum increases the burden on the au­
thorities in charge of return activities.

5.5. Surveillance: Central Mediterranean
In 2015, there were 153 946 detections
of illegal border-crossing on the Cen­
tral Mediterranean route, represent­
ing a 10% decrease compared to 2014.
The decrease is due to a fall in Syrians
(about 40 000 in 2014, but fewer than
7 500 in 2015) after a shift towards the
Eastern Mediterranean route. However,
the number of East and West Africans steadily increased from below
80 000 in 2014 to more than 108 000
in 2015 (+42%). This increase indicates
that this route also faces very strong
pressures and migrants continue to ar­
rive in Libya, where smugglers have es­
tablished a strong foothold.
Most migrants were Africans (89% of
the detections on this route), but due to
the large volume of arrivals preventing
their adequate identification, the nation­
ality of a share of migrants remained un­
known (6%). The nationality most often
reported was Eritrean, but the regional
composition of the flow indicated that
the majority of the detected migrants
came from West Africa.
The vast majority of migrants de­
parted from Libya and were rescued by
border-control authorities after issuing

20 of 72

a distress call. Smug­glers typically make
use of frail, overcrowded boats, with a
limited fuel supply to maximise their
profits, putting migrants’ lives at con­
siderable risk. Search and rescue opera­
tions were crucial in saving the lives of
an unprecedented number of migrants.
Nevertheless, they also contributed to
the enrichment of smugglers who could
cut on travel costs and advertised to sus­
ceptible migrants that rescue operations
make the journey safer, thus increas­
ing the demand for crossings. IOM es­
timates that around 3 770 people died or
went missing at sea in 2015.
On several occasions, smugglers
threatened border guards and rescue
teams to be able to recover the rubber or
wooden boats. The share of rubber boats
has increased in 2015, an indication of
the limited availability of large wooden
boats. This shortage may be a limit­
ing factor in the number of crossings,
whereas the demand remains high.
Upon arrival, less than half of the mi­
grants who were rescued subsequently
claimed asylum.

The decisions to apply for asylum
upon arrival is largely dependent on
nationality.
The majority of migrants from Nige­
ria, the Gambia, Senegal, Bangladesh,
Mali, Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire make an
asylum application upon arrival. How­
ever, data on asylum decisions at first
instance between January and July 2015
at EU level (EASO) showed that the large
majority of these applications are re­
jected. However, very few will eventu­
ally be returned. As regards these seven
nationalities, together accounting for
over 54 000 detections of illegal bordercrossing at EU level, only fewer than
8 000 were returned in 2015. The infor­
mation of the low likelihood of being re­
turned and the ease of travelling within
the EU after arrival, is circulating among
migrants and encourages those at home
to attempt a perilous journey to the EU.
The remaining half (mostly from Er­
itrea, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Ethio­
pia) who do not often apply for asylum
upon arrival will either stay illegally
in Italy, or continue towards other EU
Member States, where they will apply
for asylum.

5.6. Surveillance: Other routes
Western Mediterranean
The cooperation between Spain and Mo­
rocco is key in maintaining low level of
detections on the land route between the
two countries, and the Moroccan author­
ities regularly prevent attempts to climb
over the fences to Melilla and Ceuta. Mo­
roccan authorities have also dug a moat
and built a high fence on its own terri­
tory in the most vulnerable areas of the
perimeter near the border with the Span­
ish cities. These measures, combined
with the implementation of the read­
mission agreement, reinforcement of
Moroccan Border Guard Units protect­
ing the fence and dismantlement of mi­
grants’ makeshift camps, have reduced
the number of attempts to cross illegally.
As a result, sub-Saharan migrants
are trying to take the sea route towards
Spain. During debriefing many claimed
that they made several attempts to jump
the fence in Melilla before taking the sea
route. Migrants are also more and more
encouraged to depart from Libya, as the
likelihood of return in the case of detec­
tion is much lower.

Western African routes
On the Western African route that con­
nects Senegal, Mauritania and Morocco
with the Canary Islands in Spain the
numbers remain negligible despite an
increasing trend for departures from Mo­
rocco. This low number is attributed to

the Memorandum of Understanding be­
tween Spain, Senegal and Mauritania,
that includes joint surveillance activ­
ities and effective return of those de­
tected crossing the border illegally. The
low number of departures resulted in
relatively few casualties. Still, at least
12 people died in March 2015 in two sep­
arate incidents involving boats that de­
parted from Morocco.

Eastern land border
On the eastern land border, a new
route, called the Arctic route, emerged
at the land border of Norway and Fin­
land with the Russian Federation. The
main targeted BCP is the Norwegian BCP
of Storskog, which registered an unu­
sually high number of applications for
asylum, with more than 5 200 applica­
tions in 2015. People seeking asylum in
Norway have taken to using bicycles to
cross the border from the Russian Federa­
tion because pedestrian traffic is banned
and drivers of vehicles are fined if they
carry passengers across without proper
documents.
Until mid-October 2015 the majority
of asylum applicants were from Syria,
but then the number of nationalities
widened, and in November Afghans
took over as the main nationality. In
Norway, the situation eased of as De­
cember, after the Russian authorities
stopped clearing transit travellers with­
out a Schengen visa.

Increasing number of Syrian
asylum seekers in Ceuta
and Melilla
In March 2015, the International
Protection and Asylum Offices were
inaugurated at BCPs in Ceuta and
Melilla (Spain). The decision came
as response to the increase, since
November 2014, of Syrian families
applying for asylum. Most appli­
cations were made in-land in Me­
lilla, suggesting that many entered
fraudulently.

However, there has been a clear dis­
placement to the Finnish border.
After crossing the border by bicycle
has been banned, migrants now acquire
cars and drive to the border by them­
selves. Some of them have lived in the
Russian Federation for a long period of
time. However, the share of those in
transit through the Russian Federation
has been recently growing, indicating
that the knowledge about the route in
the origin countries is spreading.

While activities linked to surveillance,
i.e. activities between border crossingpoints, received most media attention,
border checks are undoubtedly the core
activities of border-control authorities,
with millions of checks on entry and
exit carried out on a daily basis, at BCPs.
At the macro level, two factors con­
tributed in the recent past to shape the
flow of passengers: the first is the visa
liberalisation policy and local border traf­
fic agreements that resulted in higher
passenger flows, mostly at the land bor­
ders with Western Balkan countries. The
second is the growing overall number of
passengers due to globalisation, in par­
ticular at the air borders.
Based on Eurostat data1, the up­
ward trend already observed in air pas­
senger transport for previous years has
been confirmed: the figures available for
2014 indicate a year-on-year rise of 4.4%.
Particularly remarkable is the growth
observed for Greece (+16%) and Luxem­
bourg (+12%) as well as Portugal and Po­
land (+10%). Athens registered the highest
rise among the largest airports (+20%), fol­
lowed by Brussels (+14%) and Lisbon (+13%).
In 2014, international intra-EU flights
represented more than 44% of all passen­
gers carried at EU-28 level, followed by
extra-EU flights (more than 38%) and na­
tional flights (almost 18%). In 2014, pas­
sengers on arrival from extra-EU flights
totalled almost 169 million, compared to
164 million in 2013.2
At the land border, some Member
States started to regularly report monthly
data on regular passenger flow to Fron­
tex. However, the information still con­
tains gaps and it is not currently possible
to report an EU total. Based on partial in­
formation from Member States, the larg­
est and increasing inwards passenger
traffic, was at the Croatian land border
with Bosnia and Herzegovina. Entries

from Ukraine and the Russian Feder­
ation are also significant at the Polish
and Finnish borders.
In 2014, 15.6 million short-term uni­
form Schengen visas were issued, con­
stituting a decrease of 3.1% compared
to 2013 (16.1 million). The decrease was
mostly due to fewer visas being applied
for and issued from the Russian Federa­
tion, a trend attributed to the economic
downturn. The overall visa rejection rate
remained stable, at about 6.2%, with rate
for Africa (for a relatively low number of

visa issued: 1.7 million) standing out at
about 20%.
In December 2015, the worldwide rollout of the Schengen Visa Information
System (VIS) was completed. The VIS da­
tabase now contains all data related to
visa applications by third-country na­
tionals who require a visa to enter the
Schengen area, including biometric data
(fingerprints and a digital facial image).
Each time a visa holder enters the Schen­
gen area, their fingerprints should be
checked against the database.

Peru and Colombia granted visa-free regime
Peru and Colombia signed short-stay visa-waiver agreements with the EU
in 2015. As a result Peruvian and Colombian citizens will no longer be re­
quired to request a visa for travel to the EU. Certain conditions will still
apply, however; namely holding a return ticket, financial means for the
visit and a biometric passport. Due to delays in the availability of biome­
tric passports in Peru, the agreement may not take practical effect until
sometime in 2016. The risks arising from a visa waiver for Colombian and
Peruvian citizens will likely remain modest and concern mostly drug traf­
ficking and trafficking in human beings. As in other visa liberalisation
cases, passenger flow and refusals of entry are likely to increase.
Visa liberalisation dialogues are ongoing between the EU, Kosovo*, Geor­
gia and Ukraine with the aim of taking gradual steps towards the longterm goal of visa-free travel, provided that conditions for well-managed
and secure mobility are in place.

5.8. Border checks: Refusals
travellers. Indeed, border-control author­
ities face different challenges during bor­
der checks at air and land borders.
As in 2014, Ukrainians were the top
ranking nationality for refusals of entry
at EU level. Among Member States, Po­
land reported the largest number of re­
fusals of entry in absolute terms, mostly
to nationals of Ukraine at the land bor­
ders. However, it is at the land border
between Hungary and Serbia that the
number of refusals of entry is the largest
per passenger. This particular pressure is
due to the higher passenger flow follow­

ing visa liberalisation in the Western Bal­
kans, and the subsequent increased role
of border-control authorities in check­
ing entry requirements, which was pre­
viously the responsibility of consular
authorities.
At the air borders, as in 2014, Albani­
ans continued to rank as the top nation­
ality. Albanians ranked first for refusals
of entry at the air border in eight Mem­
ber States and Schengen Associated
Countries. This predominance of Alba­
nians in the data on refusals of entry
coincides with the visa liberalisation
regime that entered into force in 2011
for Albanians.
As in previous years, the main reasons
for refusals of entry were the lack of valid
visa (25%) and the lack of appropriate
documentation justifying the purpose
of stay (28%). The number of persons re­
fused entry due to an alert in the SIS sys­
tem represented only about 8.2% of the
total, with 9 762 refusals issued in 2015.

© European Commission

In 2015, among regular travellers, Mem­
ber States reported a total of 118 495 refus­
als of entry at the external borders of the
EU, a stable trend compared to the pre­
vious year. Refusals of entry represented
only a fraction of passenger flow, indi­
cating that the overwhelming number
of passengers crossing the borders are
bona fide travellers.
Most refusals of entry were reported
at the land border (66 503, or 56% of the
total). This is linked to the nature of the
flow at the land border, which is mostly
composed of commuters and low budget

5.9. Border checks: Fraudulent documents
In 2015, Member States reported a total
of 8 373 document fraudsters at BCPs on
entry from third countries to the EU. This
represented a decrease (-11%) compared to
the previous year. The most commonly
detected nationalities were Ukrainians
(1 186), Moroc­cans (867) and Syrians (745).

On air routes, most detections
continue to be reported from
Turkish airports
As in previous years, most detec­tions
were reported on air routes. At 529 de­
tections, the number of fraudulent
document users arriving from Istanbul
Atatürk decreased by 29% compared to the
previous year, yet it remained the top last
departure airport for detections of fraud­
ulent documents. The displacement of
the passengers using fraudulent docu­

24 of 72
Frontex · Risk Analysis for 2016

ments to Istanbul Sabiha Gokcen airport
was, however, observed in the autumn
of 2015 pointing to the increasing im­
portance of this smaller, budget airport.
From Nigeria to the EU, detections
steeply increased at the beginning of
2015, mostly at Rome Fiumicino, but
the trend reversed when Alitalia with­
drew its Accra/Lagos/Rome service at the
end of March 2015. Hence most docu­
ment fraud de­tections involving depar­
ture places in Af­rica were recorded on the
routes leading from Dakar (Senegal) and
Bamako (Mali) to­wards the EU.
Syrian nationals remained the most
prev­
alent nationality detected with
fraudulent docu­ments at the air borders,
mainly arriving from Turkish airports,
although the num­ber of related detec­
tions on flights from third countries was
only half as high as during 2014.

At land and sea borders, most
detections of document fraud
from Morocco and Ukraine
In 2015 most of the detections of fraud­
ulent documents at land and sea bor­
ders were reported between Morocco and
Spain, mostly involving Moroccans de­
tected upon arrival from Tangier, Mo­
rocco, and in the Spanish exclaves of
Ceuta and Melilla, often using fraudu­
lent Spanish documents.
The most often reported land border
section for detection of document fraud
remained the Polish-Ukrainian border,
which is attributable to the Ukrainian
nationals abusing Polish fraud­ulently
obtained visas.

Security risks associated with continued recognition of Syrian passports
The massive migration inflow of 2015 raised many questions related to the identity of arriving people. Concerns related to the abuse of Syrian documents have been confirmed by the observations made during the regis­tration pro­
cess. The level of security of the Syrian supporting documents (in particu­lar ID cards, family books, military books,
etc.) is very low. Forgeries detected dur­ing the registration process are of different quality, although most of these doc­
uments could be detected during proper docu­ment checks.
The situation is much more complex in the case of the abuse of Syrian passports. Although the protection level
of these doc­uments is relatively low compared to EU passports, the big­gest problem lies in the security (and the over­
all reliability) of the issuing process. Criminal organisations have access to a large number of stolen blank Syrian pass­
ports and printers used for their per­sonalisation. This allows them to produce genuine-looking passports, which may
be difficult to identify even by experienced document experts.
The very unreliable and non-secure issu­ing process of Syrian passports together with the very low security protection of the Syrian breeder (supporting) docu­ments would normally lead to non-recog­nition of Syrian passports
for the purpose of travel. Recently issued ordinary Syr­ian passports are, however, recognised for travel and for affix­
ing a visa by all EU Member States. By contrast, similarly unreliable passports of Somalia are not recognised by most
EU Member States.

Intra-Schengen
By contrast, the number of document
fraud incidents on intra-EU Schengen
movements showed a marked in­crease.
For the second year in a row, there were
more fraudulent documents detected on
intra-EU/Schengen movements than dur­
ing bor­der checks on passengers arriving
from third countries. This is partly due
to the large num­ber of migrants under­
taking secondary move­ments within the
EU, often with fraudulent documents ob­
tained in the country of en­try to the EU.
The number of persons aiming to get
to the UK with fraud­ulent document sig­
nificantly increased (+70%) com­pared to
2014. This trend is mostly attributable to
the increasing number of Albanian na­
tionals often misusing Italian and Greek
ID cards followed by Ukrainian nation­
als abusing authentic Polish ID cards.
Other national­ities aiming to reach the
UK with fraudu­lent documents were Syr­
ian, Iranian and Chinese nationals.

The current migration crisis is obvi­
ously also having an impact on the detec­
tions of fraudulent document users on
the air routes between Greece and Ger­
many, a 20% increase compared to 2014.
Most of these detections were attribut­
able to the Syrian nationals who decided
to take the fast air route to reach their
final destina­tion.

Vulnerabilities in detecting
fraudulent documents
There is no EU-wide system of docu­
ment inspection performance in place
and thus analyses focus on the threat
of document fraud as detected at the
border, rather than on the vulnerabili­
ties related to the means deployed (staff
and equipment). However, the continu­
ous development and sophistication of
the physical, optical and electronic se­
curity features of travel documents cur­
rently in circulation brings significant
challenges for border-control officers.

The outcome of an exercise carried
out by Frontex1, showed that the per­
formance of the technical equipment
shows a degree of variability, indecision
and inconsistency, resulting in a num­
ber of false documents being incorrectly
accepted as genuine. On the other hand,
the performance of border-control offic­
ers is also variable and subjective. Al­
though some experts have very high
accuracy levels, short time available for
first-line check negatively affects the de­
tections of false documents.
A number of measures could mitigate
these vulnerabilities, including for ex­
ample routine testing of deployed op­
erational systems against performance
requirements, establishing quality as­
surance process, development of intraEU mobility programs for the exchange
of first-line border-control officers and
testing their skills and performance on
a regular basis.

tan Andreevo and Lesovo. This pressure is
a consequence of intensified surveillance
along the Bulgarian and Greek land bor­
ders with Turkey. Although no data are
collected, it is also likely that the use of
this modus operandi also increased at the
Greek land border, as demonstrated by
detections of migrants on the motorway
soon after the border.
While checking all vehicles would in­
troduce undue waiting time for many
bona fide travellers, targeted checks on
some vehicles meeting specific risk crite­
ria would make it possible to determine
with more precision the extent of the
phenomenon and better prevent it. Oper­

ational risk analysis techniques, similar
to those used by customs or for check­
ing lorries at the border between Schen­
gen Member States and the UK, could be
adapted to the specificities of the exter­
nal borders. This is an area of work for
border-control authorities that would
greatly benefit from gathering and pool­
ing intelligence at EU level. This would
result in preventing clandestine entries
and reduce the number of casualties.

In 2015, the number of detections of
clandestine entries at BCPs during bor­
der checks (people hiding in vehicles to
avoid border control) remained much
lower than the number of detections
between BCPs during surveillance activ­
ities (detections of illegal border-cross­
ing). However, this indicator is not
uniformly reported by Member States,
and for example Greece reports clandes­
tine entries as part of detections of ille­
gal border-crossing between BCPs, while
other Member States do not report any
detections although police information
reveals such cases.
The total number of detections
(3 642) thus underestimates the actual situation.
This is further confirmed by the large
number of detections of clandestine en­
try reported at the internal border (for
example between France and the UK),
as well as by police reports of in land de­
tections. The tragic discovery of 71 dead
bodies in a lorry that travelled from Hun­
gary to Austria in August 2015 illustrates
that this dangerous modus operandi is often used by smugglers, regardless of
its deadly consequences.
Most of detections were reported at
the land border between Bulgaria and
Turkey, through which a large share of
the migratory flow transiting Turkey is
channelled. The Bulgarian BCPs most af­
fected by clandestine entries were Kapi­

People hiding in vehicles is a growing concern of the road transport industry
People hiding in vehicles is a growing
concern for the road transport industry,
including threats to drivers, breaking
into trucks and damaging loads, with
inevitable economic consequences. The
problem is particularly acute at specific
locations near border areas, when slowly
moving or stationary trucks provide an

opportunity for migrants to get in. The
border between France and the UK, near
Dover and Calais, is a vivid example of
this phenomenon.
Some private sector solutions are be­
ing introduced, for example drivers buy
CO2 detectors which can send an SMS or
e-mail alert in case of the level of the sat­

uration changes. Some Member States
have developed a code of conduct, which
sets out how drivers should secure their
vehicles, but improvements and a uni­
form EU approach on this issue are still
needed.

5.11. Illegal stayers on exit
Border-control authorities also carry out
checks on exit. This offers an opportu­
nity to record the exit of potentially over­
staying third-country nationals, holders
of a Schengen visa or simply a biometric
passport in the case of travellers benefit­
ing from visa liberalisation who may stay
up to three months within a six-month
period. In 2015, border-control authori­
ties reported a total of 67 316 detections
of illegal stayers on exit.
Most illegal stayers on exit were re­
ported by Germany at the air border,
mostly nationals from Kosovo* and Tur­
key returning home. At the EU level,
the largest number of detections was re­
lated to Ukrainians, mostly reported by
Poland. The comparatively low number
of illegal border-crossings of Ukrainians
indicates that most of them had entered
the EU legally and then overstayed, or
had entered the EU abusing legal chan­
nels, such as fraudulently obtained work
or business visas.
In most cases, following a detec­
tion on exit, the person continues
to travel and is recorded in the SIS.

5.12. Cross-border crime
Frontex promotes European border man­
agement with a special focus on irregular
migration flows. Applying the concept
of Integrated Border Management, it
additionally supports Member States in
combating organised crime at the exter­
nal borders, including the smuggling of
goods and trafficking in human beings.

Smuggling of illicit drugs
Cannabis from the Western Balkans
and North Africa
According to the EMCDDA European
Drug Report 20141, 80% of drug seizures
in Europe were of cannabis, Morocco
being the main provider although its
production is in decline. Spain reported
around two thirds of the total quantity
of cannabis resin seized in Europe, but
routes are diversifying, and other EU
countries are increasingly used as en­
try points. In June 2015, two vessels of
the Italian Guardia di Finanza and Fron­
tex assets intercepted a Turkish flagged
cargo ship sailing from Morocco and
seized 12 tonnes of cannabis resin worth
more than EUR 40 million. Ten crew
members, all Turkish nationals, were

ish police.
Regarding herbal cannabis, Turkey
has been seizing larger quantities of
herbal cannabis than all EU countries
combined. At the same time, Greece
has reported large increases, pointing
to an emerging route in the Eastern
Mediterranean.

erlands, some countermeasures have
proven successful, such as the establish­
ment of joint customs and border guard
teams to identify couriers through preflight checks and risk profiles. However,
stricter controls on a set of high-risk air
routes tended to lead to the use of alter­
native routes.

Cocaine from South America

Heroin from Afghanistan, Iran and
Pakistan

According to EMCDDA’s calculations co­
caine is the third most intensively smug­
gled drug in Europe. However, seizures,
increasing from the mid-nineties till
2007, have been declining since 2009.
Most of the cocaine is seized by Spain,
but trafficking routes to Europe are diver­
sifying and seizures were recently made
in ports of the Eastern Mediterranean,
Baltic and Black Sea. Cocaine is more­
over smuggled on pleasure boats and
through container shipments, where it
is often hidden under legitimate goods
and by air freight.
At the air borders, organised crim­
inal networks often apply a ‘shotgun
approach’, consisting in ‘flooding’ aero­
planes with dozens of couriers per flight
in the expectation that a sufficient num­
ber of them would slip through controls.
As shown by examples from the Neth­

According to the EMCDDA, more than
five tonnes of heroin were seized in the
EU in 2014 (the latest year for which data
are available), following a continuous
decrease in heroin use in Europe over
the past decade. Most of the heroin con­
sumed in the EU is produced in Afghan­
istan and transported along a variety of
routes, including through Turkey and
Balkan countries, the Northern route,
which heads through Central Asia and
the Russian Federation, and increasingly
the Southern route via the Persian Gulf
by sea, sometimes including passages
through Africa.
The latest annual statistics on seizures
showed that more heroin was seized in
Turkey than in all EU Member States
combined, and the gap in large seizures
within most countries of South-East­
ern Europe points to a substantial num­

ber of undetected shipments. On this
route, heroin is often smuggled into the
EU by individual travellers in small and
medium amounts. Regular cooperation
between border guards and customs au­
thorities is of particular importance for
the detection of drugs smuggled by crim­
inals posing as individual travellers.

Smuggling of weapons

Law-enforcement experience shows that in contrast to most locally commit­
ted crimes, cross-border crimes are highly complex, as their planning and
execution reaches into several countries. Thus local solutions are limited
in their effectiveness, and law-enforcement and political cooperation with
third countries is indispensable for a substantial reduction of these offenses.
In addition to the requirement to cooperate internationally, cooperation is
also needed between the different competent law-enforcement authorities.
However, due to the legal and institutional national characteristics, border
guard authorities along the external borders of the EU have different types
and degrees of responsibilities in the fight against transnational crime. Re­
garding the prevention of smuggling of illicit goods, in certain Member States
border-control authorities play only an assisting role, while in other Mem­
ber States they share their tasks with customs or are able to conduct inves­
tigations. Only with a more coherent approach to implementing Integrated
Border Management including closer cooperation between the different au­
thorities operating at the external borders, can cross-border criminality be
more effectively prevented.

ties will be crucial in the effective fight
against trafficking of firearms.
Exit of stolen motor vehicles
According to Eurostat, the total number
of vehicles including cars, motorcycles,
buses, lorries, construction and agri­
cultural vehicles stolen in the EU was
steadily falling between 1998 and 2013.
Among the reasons for the decline were
the advanced technical protection tech­
nologies developed by the producers and
intensified international law-enforce­
ment cooperation.
Only a small share of the vehicles sto­
len in the EU are detected at its exter­

The terrorist attacks in France in 2015
have shown that the effective control
of firearms is indispensable to fight ter­
rorism. Few days before the November
attack, during a routine check German
police officers discovered pistols, hand
grenades, Kalashnikov rifles with am­
munition and an explosive agent. The
weapons were transported from Monte­
negro to France in a car of a man proba­
bly linked to suspects behind the Paris
attacks.
Police investigations have generally
shown a wide availability of militarygrade arms including AK-47s, rocket-pro­
pelled grenade launchers on European
illicit markets, especially in the dark
net, which is a network that is not ac­
cessible through conventional search
engines. Many of these weapons are il­
legally traded from former conflict re­
gions such as the Western Balkans,
where around 800 000 weapons are es­
timated to be in illegal civilian posses­
sion in Bosnia and Hercegovina alone. A

ment authorities both inland and at the

nal borders. Detections at the borders
reported to Frontex showed an decrease
from over 430 in 2014 to almost 350 in
2015, including cars, lorries, trailers,
boats, excavators, agricultural machines
and motorbikes.

Smuggling of excise goods
Most excise goods smuggled across
the EU’s external borders are tobacco
products. According to estimates of the
European Commission, the illicit trade
in tobacco products costs the EU and its
Member States EUR 10 billion a year in
lost tax revenues. Not only individual
consumers and small scale smugglers
from economically weak border regions
try to take advantage of existing price
differences. Large-scale criminal busi­
nesses illicitly import cigarettes from
as far away as Asia, especially to West­
ern European markets.
In 2015, the largest share of illicit cig­
arettes reported to Frontex was smuggled
across the EU borders from Turkey: More
than 228.7 million pieces of cigarettes
were seized by the authorities in over
300 cases. In turn, more than 11.8 mil­
lion cigarettes were seized at the eastern
borders, about 0.8 million on the West­
ern Balkan route and half a million at
the Spanish border.

5.13. In the EU: Illegal stayers, Asylum, Facilitators
Illegal stayers

Facilitators

In 2015, Member States reported 701 625
detections of illegal stay, which repre­
sented a generally increasing trend com­
pared to the previous year. However, it
should be borne in mind that the Neth­
erlands, since 2012, due to technical rea­
sons, only reported detections on exit and
not those inland.
In terms of nationalities, the large
numbers of Syrians, Afghans, Iraqi and
Eritrean are artificially inflated by de­
tections of people not meeting require­
ments for legal stay before they apply
for asylum.
Looking at detections over the past
few years, Moroccans stand out as one of
the main nationalities detected staying
illegally (above 20 000 annual detections
between 2009 and 2015), although their
detections at the external borders remain
much lower. This indicates that Moroc­
cans tend to cross the external borders le­
gally, but then exceed their legal period
of stay within the EU. The same applies
to Algerians, although their number is
lower (about 10 000 annual detections
since 2009).

The facilitation of illegal immigra­
tion remains a significant threat to the
EU. Detections of facilitators rose from
10 234 in 2014 to 12 023 in 2015. The rise
was mostly due to in­creases reported in
Spain, France and Italy.
Facilitation services related to the il­
legal im­migration to the EU and second­
ary move­ments between Member States
are in high demand and generate sig­
nificant profits for facilitators involved.
The facilitation of illegal immigration is
a growing market prompting existing
criminal groups to adapt their business
models and shift to the facilitation of il­
legal immigration.
An increase in the number of irreg­
ular mi­grants reaching the EU as part
of mixed mi­gration flows will sustain
and increase the demand not only for
facilitation services re­lated to entry into
the EU, but also those associated with
attempts to legalise the stay of irregu­
lar migrants (such as the use of forged
identity or supporting documents, mar­
riages of convenience to obtain residence
permits and the abuse of asylum pro­
visions in order to tem­porarily obtain
leave to remain).

There is also a heightened risk of hu­
man trafficking (in the form of forced la­
bour, prostitution, crime) in connection
with payments demanded from the mi­
grants by their facilitators.

Asylum
According to EASO, over 1.35 million ap­
plications for asylum were registered in
2015 – double the number in 2014. This
number marked the highest level re­
ceived in the EU since EU-level data col­
lection began in 2008 and exceeds the
numbers of refugees received by the then
EU-15 in the 1990s during the Balkan
wars. According to EASO, 95% of this to­
tal was comprised of persons applying for
the first time in the EU. The main nation­
alities of applicants were Syrians (over
334 000), Afghans (over 168 000) and Ira­
qis (over 114 000), together accounting for
50% of all applications. Applicants from
Western Balkan countries comprised 16%
of the total (over 192 000), despite an ex­
tremely low recognition rate, thus ham­
pering Member States’ ability to provide
protection to those clearly in need.
EASO data include figures on implicit
withdrawals of asylum applications,

Difficulties in implementing
the Dublin asylum system
to assist Greece and Italy by moving
persons in clear need of international
protection to other Member States to
process their asylum claims. The reloca­
tion mechanism was aimed at nation­
als of countries who have an average
EU-wide asylum recognition rate equal
to or higher than 75%, which thresh­
old in 2014 was passed for Syrians, Er­
itreans and Iraqis. Frontex and EASO
worked together in hotspots to identify
the nationalities and ensure that they
were informed of the possibility to be
relocated and assisted with the regis­
tration of the asylum application. How­
ever, due to the practical challenges of
implementing this entirely new system
by the end of 2015, only 272 applicants
had been relocated from Italy and Greece
to other Member States.
In October 2015, Frontex and EASO
both instituted emergency data collec­
tions in order to keep track of the massive
flows of migrants via the Eastern Med­
iterranean and Western Balkan routes.
This showed that while the numbers
of illegal border-crossers to the Greek
islands corresponded to the eventual
numbers of formally lodged asylum ap­
plications, they were made almost exclu­
sively in countries of destination rather
than those of transit: while the initial
route had been through Hungary, after
the closure of the green border in Sep­
tember 2015, asylum seekers did not ef­
fectively need to apply for asylum until
they reached Austria and countries fur­
ther north and west.

Member State and then absconds. Many
of those implicitly withdrawing subse­
quently apply for international protection
in another Member State and may even­
tually be returned in accordance with
the stipulations of the Dublin III Reg­
ulation. In 2015, implicit withdrawals
were particularly high in Hungary (56%
of all withdrawals) and Bulgaria. Im­
plicit withdrawals might indicate po­
tential misuse of the asylum procedure
whereby an individual makes an appli­
cation for international protection at the
border in order to circumvent the normal
requirements.
A number of Member States faced diffi­
culty, in the context of the migration cri­
sis, in transposing and implementing the
new requirements on Member States un­
der the asylum acquis that came into force
on 20 July 2015. The situation in main
countries of arrival (Italy and Greece) in­
deed demonstrated that large numbers of
potential applicants for asylum arriving
in an irregular manner by sea can lead
to severe difficulties in the registration
foreseen by the new legislation. Even full
implementation of existing legislation,
in particular the requirement to upload
into the Eurodac system the fingerprint
records of all illegal border-crossers and
asylum applicants, has shown to be ex­
tremely difficult in areas where author­
ities were faced with huge numbers of
daily arrivals, often in remote locations.
In September 2015, an emergency re­
location mechanism was triggered via
the passing of two Council Decisions

Figure 7. A member of the Belgian Immigration Office speaks with
a Palestinian woman

In its 2011 decision in M.S.S. v.
Belgium and Greece, the European
Court of Human Rights found that
the living conditions for asylum
seekers in Greece amounted to in­
human and degrading treatment,
and that shortcomings in the asy­
lum procedure placed refugees at
risk of being returned to a coun­
try where they could be persecuted
(known as ‘refoulement’ and ille­
gal under international law). The
decision was the first time Dub­
lin transfers from across the Eu­
ropean Union had effectively been
suspended to a particular Member
State. Returns to Greece have not
resumed nearly five years after the
decision.
In 2014, in its decision on the
Tarakhek case, the Court held
that there would be a violation
of Article 3 (prohibition of inhu­
man or degrading treatment) of
the European Convention on Hu­
man Rights if the Swiss author­
ities were to send the applicants
back to Italy under the Dublin Reg­
ulation without having first ob­
tained individual guarantees from
the Italian authorities that the ap­
plicants would be taken charge of
in a manner adapted to the age of
the children and that the family
would be kept together. The effects
of the Tarakhel case could already
be seen in early 2015. In the Neth­
erlands, authorities have already
implemented new procedures for
transfers to Italy requiring indi­
vidual guarantees that reception
standards will be met, and allow­
ing for claims to be processed in the
Netherlands if obtaining a guaran­
tee takes an unreasonable amount
of time. German authorities im­
plemented a similar procedure for
families to be transferred to Italy;
and the decision has also been used
successfully to challenge transfers
in national courts in Switzerland,
Germany, and Belgium.

5.14. In the EU: Secondary movements
In 2015, subsequent to the massive ar­
rivals of persons crossing the border il­
legally, secondary movements of people
within the EU reached unprecedented
levels. Indeed, the vast majority of the
people who entered illegally through
Greece, and a large proportion of those
entering through Italy, undertook sec­
ondary movements to their final des­
tinations, mostly Germany, resulting
in about a million persons travelling
through the EU without proper travel
documents. The unprecedented volume
of these secondary movements created
new challenges for Member States, in­

cluding the registration and transport
of large flows of persons, as well as in­
ternal security issues linked to the chal­
lenges in determining the identity and
motivation of the migrants.
Following chaotic scenes at the ex­
ternal borders in September 2015, when
migrants forced their way through the
border and onboard trains and buses,
several Schengen Member States rein­

troduced temporary internal border con­
trols. Additional internal border controls
were reinstated after the terrorist attack
in Paris in November 2015. In most cases,
the reintroduction of internal controls
means the presence of police patrols with
the authority to perform border checks.
Their intensity and frequency are, how­
ever, not comparable to the controls at
the external borders.
The main effect of the reintroduc­
tion of controls at internal borders has
been the restraining of the chaos at the
borders. However, between September

Public-private cooperation
at EU internal borders
Some Member States have intro­
duced measures to involve trans­
port companies in the prevention
of undocumented migrants from
entering their territories. Nor­
way requires ferry providers to ask
passengers for a valid travel docu­
ment, both when passengers buy
the ticket and before they board
the ferry to Norway, for example
on Danish or German soil. Den­
mark’s parliament has approved
a bill, which could, under cer­
tain circumstances, oblige bus,
train, and ferry operators to re­
fuse transportation across Danish
borders to passengers who cannot
present a valid travel document. In
a law, which entered into force in
December 2015, Sweden required
cross-border transport providers to
have all passengers controlled on
foreign soil before they enter Swe­
den. While Sweden’s state-owned
train operator SJ has stopped ser­
vices across the Öresund bridge
from Denmark because it did not
see itself in the position to carry
out the demanded identity checks
in time, Öresundståg, another
train operator which runs a Den­
mark-Sweden commuter service
introduced an around 30-minutelong stop at Kastrup station to al­
low for document checks.

Reintroduction of control at internal borders between Schengen Member States after September 2015
In November, Sweden reintroduced controls on its ferry connections from the
south and on the bridge to Denmark. Those
migrants who enter the country on entry
routes that are covered by the controls
and who apply for asylum are systematically registered and fingerprinted. Under
a new Swedish law, which entered into
force on 4 January 2016, transport companies are obliged to ensure that passengers on the way to Sweden have a valid
travel document.

Norway, also facing an increased migratory flow, reintroduced border controls in
November to identify among the migrants
those who want to apply for asylum.

Denmark reintroduced border controls
with particular focus on the sea and land
borders with Germany on 4 January 2016.

Austria reintroduced temporary controls
at its border with Slovenia, Italy, Hungary
and Slovakia, from where the largest flow
of persons without legal travel documents
is arriving. Checks are carried out in a flexible manner, adapting to the situation on
the basis of intelligence.

In mid-October, Hungary reintroduced
controls at its border with Slovenia for ten
days. The step was taken after Hungary had
extended its temporary technical obstacle
with Serbia also to Croatia, which effectively stopped migration through Hungary
and diverted the transit of migrants to Slovenia and further to Austria.

The Slovenian authorities reintroduced
controls on their side of the border with
Hungary. Their purpose was to protect this
border section when the main migratory
flow still transited through Hungary. These
controls ended by the end of October.

and dispatching of these persons to Germany. In November, following the terrorist

also smaller routes.

Please note that the number of effective returns may sometimes be larger than return decisions, as a return decision issued in a given month may be effectively enforced at a later date. Also, return decisions may be issued
without prejudice to the person’s right to apply for asylum. Returns between Member States are not included (for example between France and Italy). Effective returns do not necessarily mean returns to the country of origin
and, for example in the case of Syrians, they include returns of persons to third countries considered to be safe (for example from Hungary to Serbia).

5.15. In the EU: Return
In 2015, Member States reported 286 725
return decisions issued to third-country
nationals as a result of an administra­
tive or judicial decision, which was a 14%
increase compared to 2014. The absolute
total number of migrants subject to re­
turn decisions is still underestimated by
this indicator, as data on decisions were
unavailable from, inter alia, France, the
Netherlands and Sweden, which only
reported effective returns but presuma­
bly issued a high number of decisions.
As in previous years, the number of
return decisions was much larger than
the total number of effective returns to
third countries (175 220). The main rea­
sons for non-return relate to practical
problems in the identification of return­
ees and in obtaining the necessary docu­
mentation from non-EU authorities.1 In
addition, many decisions to return vol­
untarily do not materialise as the persons
decide to stay illegally. Some Member
States reported that, over time, several
1

Communication from the Commission to the
Council and the European Parliament on Return
Policy, COM(2014) 199 final

return decisions have been issued to the
same individuals. Although it is not pos­
sible to quantify the phenomenon, as
data at EU level are anonymised, it illus­
trates the difficulty to effectively imple­
ment a return decision.
Finally, return decisions may also
concern voluntary returns that are not
registered. In fact, for voluntary return,
only few Member States, such as the
Netherlands, apply a policy of controlled
departure, monitoring if migrants in­
deed complied with the return decision.
In these circumstances it is difficult to
ascertain that a return decision has ef­
fectively been implemented.
Within the number of effective re­
turns to third countries, 47% were re­
ported to be on a voluntary basis and 41%
were forced returns, while for 12%, the
type of return was not specified.
On an annual basis, the number of
effective returns has remained relatively
stable over the years, despite large fluc­
tuations in the number of detections of
illegal border-crossing and detections of
illegal stay. This stability illustrates that
the number of effective returns largely

34 of 72
FRONTEX · for 2016 (draft version) Risk Analysis

depends on available resources, in par­
ticular on the number of officers and the
detention capacities prior to the return.
In terms of nationalities, there is
a striking difference between the na­
tionalities detected crossing the bor­
der illegally or staying illegally in the
EU, and those effectively returned. In­
deed, many detections of illegal bordercrossing or even detections of illegal
stay concern migrants who will apply
for asylum and thus are not returned.
In 2015, more than half of the effective
returns concern nationals whose nation­
alities were not easily granted asylum
at first instance.
The Commission noted in its com­
munication on return policy that data
on basic parameters such as the aver­
age length of detention, grounds for de­
tention, number of failed returns, and
use of entry bans proved to be available
in only a limited number of Member
States. Moreover, common definitions
and approaches concerning data collec­
tion are frequently absent, impacting
on the comparability of such data across
the EU.

6.1. Key countries of origin and transit

Transit country index
The index is designed to capture the
current transit status of selected third
countries related to the risk of illegal
border-crossing at the external bor­
ders. It is calculated using FRAN data
for illegal border-crossings. As there
are large differences among countries,
a logarithmic scale has been used for
the detections of illegal border-cross­
ing of transiting migrants. The transit
nature of a country is also captured by
the number of nationalities detected.
The outcome stretches from 0 to 5,
where a score near 5 shows the coun­
tries with the highest importance for
transit of migrants then detected for
illegal border-crossing along the ex­
ternal borders.
This score provides for a guide of
where efforts related to transit coun­
tries, for example the development of
a cooperation assistance package or
the posting of a Liaison Officer, are
likely to make the largest immedi­
ate impact. This index focuses on the
risk of illegal border-crossing. It does
not consider other risks, for example
risks typically associated with the air
border, where third-country airports
may play a significant role.

For risk analysis the four-tier access
model indicates the different areas in
which the analysts will seek informa­
tion. The first tier represents third coun­
tries, analysed from the point of view of
irregular migration in countries of ori­
gin and transit towards the EU.
This analysis therefore briefly looks into
the key third countries from where most
of people are likely to continue to come
or which most will have to transit before
irregularly entering the EU. For the first
time, indicators on transit countries and
countries of origin based on FRAN data are

proposed to gauge the relative importance
of a set of third countries, with a focus on
the risk of detection of migrants crossing
illegally the land or maritime external
borders. This risk is indeed currently the
most pressing to address.
The third countries assessed as origin
or transit countries include Syria, Iraq,
Afghanistan, Pakistan, Western Balkan
countries, Libya, Turkey, Morocco, and
the countries of the Horn of Africa and
West Africa. Together, they represent
more than 90% of all detections of ille­
gal border-crossing in 2015.

EU-Turkey agreement of 29 November 2015 offers great incentives
for Turkey when it comes to slowing down and stopping irregular
movements across the common borders. Furthermore, EU-Turkey
readmission agreement offers many opportunities to engage in supporting Turkey’s return of third-country nationals to their countries
of origin (e.g. Pakistan), which in turn should reduce Turkey’s appeal
as a transit country.

While Libya’s appeal as a destination country has diminished, the country is still attracting thousands of transiting migrants from African and
Southeast Asian countries who aim to reach Europe via irregular maritime routes. The Central Mediterranean route might have registered
a slight decrease in 2015 when compared to 2014 but these figures
are still as high compared with the overall number of illegal bordercrossings in the EU in previous years.
Libya’s inability to have a post-conflict political transition resulted
in two opposing power blocs. All state institutions are fragmented
and weak, including Libya’s security establishment and the judiciary.
Therefore, the country’s vast land and sea borders remain largely uncontrolled.
All these uncertainties have been exploited by the facilitation networks,
whose ruthlessness has resulted in a number of maritime tragedies.

practically closed, notably thanks to effective cooperation agreements
between Spain and Morocco. With regards to air routes, Casablanca
re­mains the most popular air hub for sub-Saharan migrants (frequently

As for entry to Morocco, the growing risk of the abuse of passports of
ECOWAS countries falling under the visa-free regime with Morocco
cannot be excluded.

Libya is also very important theatre of jihad, which is also the closest to the EU’s external borders. Moreover, Libya has been attracting battle-hardened jihadists from Syria, which has resulted in the
same atrocious modi operandi being utilised elsewhere besides Syria.
The UN-brokered peace talks, also facilitated by other regional actors,
have brought about a rapprochement between the House of Representatives and the General National Congress. The deal signed on 17
December in Morocco to form a unity government offers hope but not
a guarantee for a smooth political transition. The challenge is to identify the right interlocutors within the Libyan establishment who could
over time make Libya less attractive for transiting irregular migrants.

altogether. The latter option accelerated in 2015 when the Syrian huSudan
manitarian crisis led to a migratory crisis in the EU.
The staggering number of EU citizens who joined the conflict as jihadists has resulted in a number of returnees opting to use irregular
means of travelling. Islamist extremists will exploit irregular migration flows whenever such movements’ fit their plans.
In Iraq the volatile security situation has brought about the internal displacement of at least 4 million people. IS/Da’ish has been able
to take control over vast areas and thus also contributed to movements of people both within the country and the immediate region,
and also to Europe.
The EU-Turkey Action Plan should further assist fleeing Syrians in the
immediate region. However, in the absence of a resolution to the
conflict, it is assessed that Syrians will continue to leave the country.
There are more and more international players supporting the Iraqi
authorities. The success of these initiatives depends on political stability and security, without which there will be more outflows of
Iraqi citizens.

pushing Pakistanis to migrate are of economic nature as 80% of persons interviewed in a study on Determinants of International Migration in Pakistan1 consider low paid jobs as reasons to

plays a lesser role in migration.
The main destination for the Pakistani economic migrants is the Gulf region, hosting roughly 3.5 million Pakistanis. If oil prices remain low, that
will neg­atively impact Pakistani employees in the Gulf region and make
other destinations like the EU more attractive. The EU is also host to a
large Pakistani diaspora, which can play a role in attracting migration.

Migration flow from the Horn of Africa consists of young men from Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia and more recently also from Sudan. It is driven
by regional security issues, slow economic development, and lack of
long-term livelihood options for refugees in the region. While the security situation is improving in Somalia, many Somalis were forced to
return from Yemen given the civil war there. In turn, this may increase
the number of persons going to Europe.
Nationality swapping is very likely, as people living in different countries often speak the same or very similar language (e.g. Ethiopians
claiming Eritrean nationality or Sudanese claiming Somali origin). Security concerns associated with arrival of persons active in terrorist
groups, such as Al Shabab, are assessed as negligible given the local
agenda of these groups. Migratory movements from the Horn of Africa are often financed by members of diaspora, which in turn creates
a self-sustaining dynamics. The more migrants are able to settle in Europe, the more people are likely to attempt the dangerous journey.

Somalia, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Sudan are part of the Khartoum Process,
which, with EU funding, aims at assisting countries in setting up and
managing reception centres and developing a regional framework to
facilitate the return of migrants, mostly from Europe. In 2015, Ethiopia and the EU signed a joint declaration which will enable them to
better address the issue of migration and mobility.

Most West Africans who cannot obtain an EU visa and still wish to
reach the EU illegally now opt to first travel by land to Agadez in Niger. From there, smuggling services can be easily found. Up to 6 000
weekly arrivals in Agadez were registered in 2015, according to media reports, and from there migrants cross the Sahara desert to reach
Europe via the Central Mediterranean route, making a maritime crossing departing from Libya. Routing through Niger is currently the preferred option despite the turmoil in Libya and a high risk of loss of life
when crossing the Mediterranean. Part of the challenge for the Nigerien authorities is the fact that the smuggling service industry is
fragmented rather than controlled by one group. Authorities in Niger
also face transiting migrants who are determined to reach Libya and
Italy, and have entered the territory of Niger legally (under ECOWAS
free-movement protocol) and for the most part are able to finance
their onward journey. Evidence from debriefing suggest that many
have started their journey after receiving information or encouragement from friends or relatives already in the EU. The suggestion was
that it is now fairly easy to reach the EU regardless of the heightened risk of dying in the desert or at sea. The motivation for migration may vary among individuals, but most are believed to be pushed
by economic motivations.
The EU Action Plan against migrant smuggling (COM(2015) 285 final) acknowledges that a lack of effective return of persons arriving
from West Africa and not eligible for protection is encouraging others
to try their chances, leading to unnecessary human suffering as migrants face harassment, exploitation, violence and even death while
trying to cross the desert or the Mediterranean Sea. The Emergency
Trust Fund for Africa (launched at Valletta summit at the end of 2015)
will benefit a wide range of countries across West Africa. The Fund
will be addressing root causes of irregular migration.

Border authorities have been under in­
tense pressure for years, but the large
and growing annual number of detec­
tions of illegal border-crossing along the
EU external border has exposed the dif­
ficulties they face to adequately perform
border control. Although Greece and It­
aly have been under particularly intense
pressure as the two main entry points
reporting up to 6 000 arrivals per day,
for several other Member States, largescale inflows of migrants was a new ex­
perience, revealing the complexity of
the challenge to manage sudden large
flows. In an environment of continued
pressure on the EU’s external borders,
these challenges will be best addressed
in a coordinated manner, requiring har­
monised applications of legislations and
pooling of resources.
In the Aegean Sea, although the main
landing areas continued to be Lesbos,
Chios and Samos, smugglers have spread
their activities to a larger number of is­
lands, from south to north, thus stretch­
ing the surveillance capacities. In these
conditions it is difficult for Member
States to ensure an efficient, high and

their journey without being
detected
by any law-enforcement authorities.
At the same time, border-control au­
thorities are increasingly expected to be
engaged in search and rescue operations
covering vast areas, as well as being the
first interlocutors for a growing number
of persons presenting themselves at the
EU borders in search of international asy­
lum. Most of the resources are thus al­
located to search and rescue operations,
as well as local reception facilities to reg­
ister migrants. The challenge is com­
plicated due to the fact that many are
undocumented and therefore their reg­
istration has to be based on their decla­
ration. In these circumstances,

fraudulent declarations of
nationality are rife.

lack of equipment for electronic checks
and also the fact that most of the docu­
ments are not proper travel documents
but rather simple identity documents.
Under strenuous circumstances, as it
was the case in Greece starting from Au­
gust 2015 when more than 100 000 ar­
rivals were observed each month, there
is risk that some migrants may be reg­
istered on the basis of forged documents
or using some else’s genuine documents
as impostors. Border-control authorities
need time to mobilise extra resources.
In the Aegean Sea, the situation had
improved by the end of 2015, with the
deployment of document experts and a
decrease in the number of arrivals. How­
ever, a resurgence of flow comparable to
the autumn of 2015 would require the
mobilisation of yet additional resources.
In Greece, for most of 2015, the sheer
number of migrants did not permit ef­
ficient practical measures to be set up
to address simultaneously the rescue at
sea, registration, screening and identi­
fication of new arrivals taking into ac­
count security issues, the provision of
assistance to those in need of assistance,
the prevention of secondary movements
within the EU, and the prevention of il­
legal border-crossing for persons not in
need of protection.
An integrated approach is required to
tackle these challenges simultaneously,

The reality is that

ing migrants (even when they do not ap­
ply for asylum on arrival) and enhanced
collaboration with law-enforcement au­
thorities to thwart the development of
the criminal networks involved in forg­
ing identity and travel documents. It
also calls for strengthened measures in
providing civil protection assistance to
face sudden and large flow of arrivals.
In the Central Mediterranean area,
the large number of simultaneous de­
partures does not enable the same rapid
intervention on all distress calls. Some
have to be given priority, putting the
lives of others at risk. This is particularly
dangerous when facilitators actually in­
tegrate the presence of vessels used for
search and rescue operations into their
planning, and therefore minimise fuel
and food provisions onboard.
In addition to these operational con­
siderations aiming at detecting, res­
cuing and accommodating migrants,
a large number of simultaneous arriv­
als also creates challenges for Member
States to apply the EU regulation con­
cerning the collection and sharing of
migrants’ fingerprinting. Indeed, the
Dublin III regulation1 requires Member
States to promptly take the fingerprints
of every third-country national or state­
less person of at least 14 years of age who
is apprehended by the competent border
authorities. In addition, these biometric

fingerprinting of all persons
detected crossing illegally
the border is not possible or
of poor quality, and in any
case, is often not transmitted
promptly to the Eurodac
central database.

Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 of the
European Parliament and of the Council
of 26 June 2013

Apart from the fact that this tool may not
be used for analysis or to support the re­
location mechanism, the biometric data
of many migrants are missing2, which
prevents law-enforcement authorities in
the EU from effectively using the Eurodac
(the EU fingerprint database for asylum
seekers and irregular border-crossers) for
the purposes of preventing, detecting or
investigating serious criminal offices or
even terrorist offenses.
The UNHCR has established that ‘some
of the procedures in place before June 2015
are no longer functioning (in particular
full registration with all aspects of iden­
tification and fingerprinting for Syrian
arrivals) due to a lack of capacity on the
islands caused, to a large extent, by the
austerity measures af­fecting the Greek
public sector. Along the same lines, re­
movals for persons not in need of interna­
tional protection have decreased by 60%

in 2015 due to a lack of resources and noncooperation with some third countries’.3
The situation was addressed in the au­
tumn, with the establishment of dedi­
cated registration teams including two
screeners, two interpreters, two Greek
Police officers for registration, two EASO
officers, and four officers doing Eurodac
registration, photographing migrants
and producing release papers for them.
The procedure is also being optimised,
and the objective is to reduce the aver­
age processing time.
As of December 2015, Frontex started
the deployment of Advanced Level Doc­
ument Officers (ALDO) in the hotspot
areas in Greece and Italy. Additional ex­
perts are expected to join.
A particularly striking and worrying
characteristic of the current refugee cri­
sis is the large number of unaccompa­
nied minors (UAMs) among the asylum
seekers. Regardless of whether unac­
companied minors are considered as
legitimate asylum seekers or not, re­
sponsibility for them falls on the state –
and often the municipality – where they
are identified. Even when minors come
from countries from which asylum ap­
plications are rarely successful, they of­
ten go into the asylum process.4

The rising number of
unaccompanied minors is one
of the challenges requiring
greater coordination between
border-control and asylum
authorities.
In the case of minors travelling undocu­
mented or with forged documents, the
issue is complicated by the lack of for­
mal proof of the age of the person. In­
deed, with no unambiguous scientific
methods to determine with sufficient
accuracy and precision the age of a per­
son, some migrants may falsely declare
their age. The large proportion of unac­
companied migrants applying for asy­
lum in Sweden has led the authorities
to strengthen the measures to deter­
mine their age.

6.3. Managing violence at the borders
The unprecedented number of detections
of illegal border-crossing has led to a rise
in violent incidents along the EU exter­
nal borders. The most life-threatening
incidents are related to violence of the
smugglers against the migrants. Moti­
vated by profits, smugglers increasingly
put migrants’ lives at risk. Smugglers
may also use violence directly threat­
ening border guards to recover boats or
escape apprehension. Finally, the large
number of people crossing the border en
masse has led to violence requiring pub­
lic order policing, an area for which
border-control authorities are not ad­
equately equipped or trained. Violence
between groups of migrants have also
been reported.

Violence of the smugglers
against migrants
In the Central Mediterranean route,
smuggling networks have entered a
more ruthless phase as regards the sea­
worthiness of the ves­sels utilised and
their lack of regard in the face of bad
sea conditions. In some cases armed
smugglers threatened mi­grants to board
flimsy inflatable craft in rough weather
conditions.
The smugglers’ quickening of migrant
de­partures in an attempt to dispatch as
many migrants as possible into a tight
window of opportunity is also assessed
to be the reason for frequent simultane­
ous de­partures from the Libyan shore­
line. The proximity of search and rescue
operations to Libya and the multitude of
concurrent incidents makes it increas­
ingly difficult for responding au­thorities
to coordinate their activities.
On the Eastern Mediterranean route,
there were reports from migrants that fa­
cilitators on the Turkish coast purposely
sank their boats, so that migrants would

have to pay for several crossing attempts.
This strategy put migrants’ lives at enor­
mous risk.

On 14 December 2015, a Swedish

Lesbos attempted to intercept a
boat with about 12 migrants on
board. After the repeated use of
light and sound signals by border
guards, the driver of the boat fired
two shots in unknown direction.
A crew member of the Swedish as­
set, following the rules of engage­
ment in such situation, fired two
warning shots in the water (safe
sector). The boat continued its
course and its driver fired again
twice in the air. Another round
of warning shots were fired by
the Swedish asset to the water.
The driver of the boat fired again
two shots and escaped by entering
Turkish territorial waters.

Frontex · Risk Analysis for 2016

In the Central Mediterranean route, the
reuse of vessels by smuggling net­works,
a phenomenon identified already in
2014, suggests that there is an apparent
lack of seaworthy vessels that can be used
for irregular migration purposes. This
resulted in more aggressive behaviour
of smugglers to recover these assets, as
demonstrated in two serious incidents,
one in February and another in April
2015, during which border guards were
held at gunpoint.
Near the Greek islands, some smug­
glers are using powerful boats to sail from
Turkey to Greece, or in some cases to Italy.
These assets are costly and thus smug­
glers are ready to take risks and resort to
violence to hold on to them.

Violence of crowds
The rapid and massive increase in detec­
tions of illegal border-crossing resulted
in large crowds forming near reception
centres along the external borders, and
later on, as they approached other bor­
der areas.
Many migrants from the Turkish
coast arrived in dispersed order on the
Greek islands, often camping out in the
main town’s parks and squares. The exi­
guity and relative isolation of the Greek
islands resulted in rapid overcrowding.
The area of the island of Leros is less than
75 square kilometres and yet is registered
around 32 000 migrants in the first nine
months of 2015. That’s roughly quadru­
ple the island’s total population.
Attempts to relocate them to nearby
registration centres or large public
spaces, such as a stadium, involves form­
ing large crowds of people. Managing
the movement of large groups of peo­
ple is difficult, and often results in un­
rest, as several incidents demonstrated,
for example, in August in several Greek
islands, where thousands of new arriv­
als were registered daily.
Similar unrest was also reported near
border areas on the route used by mi­
grants during their journey within the
EU. After Greece, incidents were reported
in the former Yugoslav Republic of Mac­
edonia, Serbia, Hungary (until Septem­
ber) and then in Croatia. Incidents were
also reported at borders between Mem­

ber States, in particular near Sentilj, at
the border between Slovenia and Austria.
Incidents involving migrants ig­
noring the orders of border officials or
even, when they are in large groups,
showing aggressive behaviour towards
of­fi cers is becoming commonplace. Inci­
dents at the border between Greece and
the former Yugoslav Republic of Mace­
donia and between Serbia and Hungary
have shown that many migrants do not
stop when re­quested to do so by border
guards, they do not obey orders of bor­
der authorities and are not afraid to en­
gage in physical contact while crossing
the border.
A common characteristic of these in­
cidents was that they involved crowds
of more than 1 000 persons who were
temporarily stopped in their movement.
They gathered people from very different
backgrounds and nationalities, render­
ing the communication of orders and
the circulation of basic information dif­
ficult. The crowds also mixed young
single men with more vulnerable fam­
ilies, including women and children,
sometimes purposely put in front of the
groups to facilitate their progression.
This makes them different from other
types of crowds typically managed by
law-enforcement authorities, for exam­
ple during sport events, demonstrations
or political riots, and drastically limits
the type of responses that can be used.
Constant arrival of new migrants also
requires a complex response, as the diffi­
culty in managing crowds is not directly

proportional to the number of people
but rather exponential. One of the first
responses is to prevent the formation
of large crowds, a condition difficult to
meet on islands or near border areas were
crossing is usually confined.
In many instances, the unrest was ex­
acerbated by migrant’s frustration. Many
expected to be welcomed in the EU, as of­
ten reported in the media, but instead
had to face registration and long waiting
times in overcrowded conditions, lead­
ing to their infuriation.
The reactions of border-control au­
thorities, whether in the EU or in transit
countries, have been diverse but eventu­
ally resulted in organising the transport
of migrants to their final destinations.
The priority of ensuring smooth trans­
port resulted in fewer scenes of chaos
scenes at the border, but also less scru­
tiny in the registration process. This is
evidenced by the growing difficulty to
report on basic facts like the national­
ity of the migrants.
These types of violent incidents were
not confined to the external borders but
were also reported along the main routes
to the final destinations of the migrants.
The number of incidents has increased
near Calais, France, at the ferry and Chan­
nel Tunnel terminals to the UK, and, this
year, incidents also developed at the bor­
ders between Slovenia and Austria. These
unusual events within the EU, widely re­
ported in the media, required the inter­
vention of police authorities to restore
and maintain order.

6.4. Preventing casualties at the border
Estimating fatalities among migrants
crossing the border illegally is daunt­
ingly difficult. Frontex does not record
these data and only has at its disposal
the number of bodies recovered during
Joint Operations. In 2015, 470 dead bodies
were reported in the Mediterranean area,
an increase of 112% compared to 2014.
Official statistics from Member States
are not comprehensively archived and of­
ten follow investigation procedures that
remain classified. In addition, even if
available, these data would only concern
the number of bodies found. However,
during maritime accidents, the number
of missing persons may be larger than
the number of recovered bodies, and in
the absence of passenger list, this num­
ber often remains unknown.
In 2013, IOM launched the ‘Missing
migrants project’ that endeavours to re­
cord the number of deaths and missing
persons when attempting to cross bor­
ders. This project relies on official statis­
tics complemented with media reports.
This methodology is prone to underesti­
mation when accidents are not reported
by the media (for example when other
news prevail), or overestimation (for ex­
ample when missing migrants are first
reported and later the number of found
bodies), but is the most comprehensive
and systematic attempt to gather infor­
mation on missing migrants.

According to IOM estimates,
about 3 770 persons went
missing or died while
crossing the border in the
Mediterranean area in 2015.
While this estimate should be treated
with caution, it confirms that the Central Mediterranean is the most danger­
ous migration route. Smugglers on this
route typically make use of frail, over­
crowded boats, with limited fuel avail­
able to maximise their profits, putting
migrants’ lives at considerable risk.
The large number of simultaneous
departures makes rapid interventions

Frontex · Risk Analysis for 2016

to all distress calls impossible. Due to
a limited number of assets, some have
to be given priority, putting the lives of
others at risk. The increasing death toll
during 2015 seems to confirm the as­
sumption that the increased number of
ves­sels engaged in rescue operations is
not nec­essarily a guarantee for a reduc­
tion in the number of fatalities as many
unseaworthy boats depart from the coast
and count on a quick rescue. Even with
many more vessels now engaged in res­
cue oper­ations it is simply impossible to
effectively rescue everyone, as there are
often multiple simultaneous rescue op­
erations over a large sea area, requiring
a high level of coordination.
Migrants are aware of the more dan­
gerous sea crossing conditions during
the winter months, with stronger winds
and colder water, and try to plan their
crossing between April and September.
In the past two years, the deadliest ac­
cidents took place either at the onset
of the season, in April, or at its end, in
September, when migrants wrongly as­
sumed that fair weather conditions were
prevailing. These periods are assosiated
with the highest risk of large accidents.
In addition to be the most dangerous
sea-crossing, the Central Mediterranean route also implies for most of the
migrants the very risky crossing of the
Sahara desert. Indeed, most migrants
originally come from sub-Saharan coun­
tries and travel overland to the Libyan
coast. This means routing through Aga­
dez, Niger, where an industry of smug­
gling services is constantly growing.
Evidence from debriefing of migrants
on the Central Mediterranean route sug­
gests that many of them started their
journey after receiving information or
encouragement from friends and rela­
tives already in the EU. The suggestion
was that it was fairly easy to reach the
EU, regardless of the risk of dying in the
desert or at sea in the Mediterranean.
The Eastern Mediterranean route
is the second most dangerous route. It

includes fatalities reported during the
often short sea crossing between the
Turkish coast and the Greek islands, and
during crossing of the Evros River.
Fatalities when crossing the Evros
River are also regularly reported. The
most dangerous areas are in the delta,
where shallow waters spread over kilo­
metres. The lower course of the river is
also very vulnerable to flooding.
The winter months also represent
highest risks for migrants’ lives, and
health hazards in general. When mi­
grants undertake a long journey, which
may take several days, through the for­
ests and rural areas and are forced to sleep
outdoors or in cold shelters at temperature
below 16°C, they are prone to hypother­
mia, frostbites and other health condi­
tions. Their risk increases if they lack
proper clothing, food and medical care.
On the Western Mediterranean
route, the sea crossing between Morocco
and Spain is relatively short, but fatali­
ties are often reported, in particular due
to the fact that small vessels are used. Ac­
cidents resulting in casualties have also
been reported during group attempts to
cross the fence. Poor health conditions
have also been reported among migrants
in the makeshift camps near the bor­
der. However, the size of the population
in the camp has been reported decreas­
ing due to efforts by Moroccan authori­
ties to return migrants to their country
of origin.
Few fatalities were reported in 2015
on the Western African route leading
to the Canary Islands. However, between
2003 and 2006, it used to be the route
with the highest death toll, with an­
nual estimates by some NGO reporting
over one thousand dead or missing per­
sons.1 Migrants departing from Mauri­
tania or Senegal had to sail for several
days in cayucos, small wooden boats not
designed for such a long sea voyage, re­
sulting in a large death toll.
Since irregular migration was effec­
tively closed on this route, following a

set of measures including cooperation
with country of departure and effective
implementation of a return agreement,

several thousand lives have
been saved.
Crossing the border illegally between
BCPs is the modus operandi representing the
highest risk for migrants’ lives, in par­
ticular during a long sea crossing. How­
ever, fatalities are also reported when
migrants hide in vehicles. Few fatal­
ities have been reported at the border
itself, but in 2015, several dramatic inci­
dents took place within the EU. The most
tragic was discovered in Austria when
71 bodies were found dead in a truck.
This incident highlighted the high risk
of suffocation for migrants hiding in ve­
hicles, and this calls for strengthened
measures at the border itself and more
thorough checks of vehicles.
This short overview of the most dra­
matic aspect of illegal border-crossing
shows that sea-crossing is by far the risk­
iest modus operandi for migrants’ lives.
Preventing departures, as demon­
strated on the Western African route
includes a set of measures ranging form

strengthened surveillance to cooperation
with third countries and effective imple­
mentation of return agreements in the
case of migrants not entitled to interna­
tional protection.
On the other hand, for many refugees
who cannot return home because of a
continued conflict, war or persecution,
resettlement programme may offer an al­
ternative to seeking the services of peo­
ple smugglers. According to UNHCR, 28
countries resettled refugees, and in 2015
Italy became a new country of resettle­
ment. However, out of the 14.4 million
refugees of concern to UNHCR around
the world, fewer than 1% are subject to
resettlement.

6.5. Health risks
The main focus of Frontex is on stren­g­
th­en­ing border-control cooperation to
facilitate bona fide migration manage­
ment, combat cross-border crime and
prevent threats to the Member States.
This includes the pre­vention of threats
to public health, as defined by the Inter­
national Health Regulations of the World
Health Organization. The Risk Analysis
for 2016 presents the WHO Regional Of­
fice for Europe’s re­view of the potential
public health risks as­sociated with the
migration phenomena and ways to ad­
equately address them, prepared under
the project ‘Public Health Aspects of Mi­
gration in Europe’ (PHAME).
Migrants are exposed to a number
of different health risks during the mi­

gration process. However, the impact
of the journey varies depending on the
category of the migrant, undocumented
migrants being among the most vulner­
able given the often harsh con­ditions
of the journey and the limited access
to health services. The following analy­
sis, therefore, focuses on undocumented
migra­tion.
The public health aspects of migra­
tion affect both healthcare and nonhealthcare workers involved in the
various stages of the migration pro­
cess, as well as resident com­munities.
In the countries of destination, mi­
gration often stretches the capacity of
healthcare systems to adapt to the addi­
tional de­mand for health services, and

the unfamil­iar and changing health
profiles and needs. Due to the common
lack of proper prepara­tion and informa­
tion, the health risks posed by migrants
are often overestimated by the receiving
communities.

Migrants
Pre-departure
The risk of acquiring vaccine-preventa­
ble dis­eases depends on the presence of
susceptible individuals in the popula­
tion and their epide­miological profile.
In many countries of ori­gin and transit
the healthcare systems are weakened by
civil unrest, wars, economic crisis and
natural disasters. The provision of pub­
lic health services including vaccination
to the population is often interrupted or

Travel and transit
Health risks at this phase vary depend­
ing on the conditions and duration of
the travel. The conditions to which mi­
grants are ex­posed to during the journey
as well as in the countries of destination
put them at risk of sexual victimisation,
violence and sexual ill health.
Refugees, asylum seekers and undoc­
umented migrants, especially women,
infants and children, were identified as
the most vulnerable ones. Other health
risks arising throughout the journey
and specially during rescue operations
include traumatism, burns, hypother­
mia, dehydration, drowning, heat­
stroke, foodborne diseases, respiratory
and skin infections.

Upon arrival

even withheld, resulting in a dramatic
reduction of the immunisation cover­
age. For instance, in the Syrian Arab
Republic, the immunisa­tion coverage
has fallen from 91% registered in 2011 to
68% in 2012. Although efforts have been
made to improve immunisation cover­
age, there are still deep concerns on the
im­munisation status of Syrians, includ­
ing those asking for asylum in European
countries.
In countries with high tuberculosis
(TB) inci­dence and prevalence, large por­
tions of the population have a status of
latent TB infec­tion that can be developed
to TB disease, of­ten contagious, in case
of decreased immune response. Such sit­
uation may be created by the hard con­
ditions of a journey which may start
before crossing the border of the coun­
try of destination.

WHO does not recommend obligatory
screening of refugee and migrant pop­
ulations for diseases, because there is
no clear evidence of benefits (or cost-ef­
fectiveness); furthermore, it can trigger
anxiety in individual refugees and the
wider community.
WHO strongly recommends, how­
ever, offering and providing health
checks to ensure access to healthcare
for all refugees and migrants in need of
health protection. Health checks should
be done for both communicable and noncommunicable diseases, with respect for
migrants' human rights and dignity.
In spite of the common perception
that there is a link between migration
and the importation of infectious dis­
eases, there is no systematic associa­
tion. Refugees and migrants are exposed
mainly to the infectious diseases that
are common in Europe, independently
of migration. The risk that exotic infec­
tious agents, such as Ebola virus, will be
imported into Europe is extremely low,
and when it occurs, experience shows
that it affects regular travellers, tour­
ists or healthcare workers rather than
refugees or migrants.
Triage is recommended at points of
entry to identify health problems in

refugees and migrants soon after their
arrival. Proper diagnosis and treatment
must follow, and the necessary health­
care must be ensured for specific popula­
tion groups (children, pregnant women,
elderly).
Each and every person on the move
must have full access to a hospitable en­
vironment, to prevention (e.g. vaccina­
tion) and, when needed, to high-quality
healthcare, without discrimination on
the basis of gender, age, religion, na­
tionality or race. This is the safest way
to ensure that the resident population is
not unnecessarily exposed to imported
infectious agents.

Host community
At reception centres, overcrowding and
inad­equate hygiene and sanitary con­
ditions cou­pled with limited access to
healthcare are well known risk factors
for acquiring a va­riety of communicable
diseases. The risk of measles, diphthe­
ria and whooping cough is enhanced in
the presence of susceptible in­dividuals.
Furthermore, scarce hygiene and sani­
tary conditions increase the risk of gas­
tro-intestinal and skin infections.

Workforce at the border and in
the reception centres
Health risks for healthcare and nonhealthcare work­force vary depending on
the resistance and vulnerability of each
individual, the working conditions as
well as the potential exposure to biolog­
ical agents. Rescuers may be exposed to
trauma, injuries, hypothermia, drown­
ing and heatstroke during rescue oper­
ations. Due to their difficult working
conditions, psycho­logical support to the
workers both at the border and in the
migration centres is also relevant. Ade­
quate screening procedures fo­cused on
communicable, non-communicable dis­
eases as well as mental health should be
performed when required and with full
re­spect to human rights.

6.6. Overcoming the obstacles
to effective returns
The measures that prevented depar­
tures from West Africa to Spain, and that
contributed to saving thousands of lives,
cannot be applied straightforwardly to
today’s challenges, with a large propor­
tion of refugees arriving from Syria and
the lack of counterparts in Libya. Yet,
this analysis examines how to best sup­
port the EU policy of safe countries of
origin.

Few effective returns but many
difficulties to return
Comparing the total number of return
decisions or the total number of effective
numbers of return against detections of
illegal border-crossing does not take into
account the fact that many detections of
illegal border-crossing will be followed
by positive asylum applications. For this
reason, it is preferable to focus on those
nationalities who are unlikely to obtain
asylum, as they represent the national­
ities most likely to be subject to return.
Considering only some of those na­
tionalities that showed a first-instance
asylum recognition rate1 of less than 30%
(Algerian, Bangladeshi, Ghanaian, Ma­
lian, Moroccan, Nigerian, Pakistani and
Sri Lankan nationals), the anal­
ysis shows that despite a strong

In its Eu­ropean Agenda on migration,
the European Commission states that
‘one of the incentives for irregular mi­
grants is the knowledge that the EU’s re­
turn system – meant to return irregular
migrants or those whose asylum appli­
cations are re­fused – works imperfectly.’
The Commission proposes several key ac­
tions in this regard, including to rein­
force and amend the Frontex legal basis
to strengthen its role on return, as well
as the development of the concept of safe
country of origin.
Implemented alone, return policies
may not be sufficient to curb the flows,
but when implemented as part of a com­
prehensive strategy developed with third
countries, returns are pivotal in effec­
tively reducing the pressure at the ex­
ternal borders. This is clearly illustrated
by the case of the Western African route,
that used to be the main point of entry
towards the EU around the year 2005,
but that has been effectively closed due
to the implementation of a set of meas­
ures including increased surveillance,
strengthen collaboration with countries
of origin to prevent departures and effec­
tive returns guaranteeing that those who
do not need asylum are quickly returned.

increase in the level of irregular migra­
tion into the EU, the number of return
decisions for these nationals is only
slowly growing, and the number of ef­
fective returns remains rather stable,
never exceeding 3 000 per month (see
Fig. 15). This first comparison indicates
that effective return are not responsive,
or even disconnected, to sharp increases
in irregular migration flows. This may be
due to national procedures to process asy­
lum applications and return decisions,
and frequent difficulties in obtaining
the collaboration of the countries of or­
igin in the identification process. The
fast track procedure introduced in sev­
eral Member States for third countries
with low positive rate of asylum deci­
sion is a step to remedy the situation. To
be effective, however, it requires a rapid
implementation of the returns, so that
the persons bound to return do not ab­
scond. The pooling of resources among
­Member States can contribute to the ef­
fective implementation of Member States
return decisions.
In addition, it is often the case that
for nationals coming from countries
with a low first-instance asylum recog­
nition rate, they do not spontaneously
apply for asylum, but their return proce­
dure is often the outcome of detections
of illegal stay (most often overstayers),
and they frequently apply for asylum
during the return procedure. This often
results in longer detention time, and
thus limiting the number of available
detention places.
The analysis of the situation of people
from Kosovo* also reveals some difficul­
ties in rapidly implementing returns. In­
deed, considering the period 2014–2015,
and thus lessening possible time-lag due

to the length of the procedure, it is ob­
vious that the peak in detections of il­
legal border-crossing observed between
September 2014 and February 2015 did
not correspond to an increase in effec­
tive returns. Between January and April
2015, more than 80 000 Kosovo* citizens
applied for international protection in
the EU/Schengen area. In contrast, the
number of return decisions made by EU
Member States increased only temporar­
ily and to a limited extent, and peaked
at around 1 400 in March 2015. Likewise,
the average monthly number of effective
returns doubled from a very low level in
2014 to only around 840 in 2015, which
after all means that only around 15 per­
cent of all Kosovo* citizens with nega­
tive asylum decisions were effectively
returned to their home country.
Delays in return also often encourage

under different identities than in their
home countries. It is thus sometimes
difficult for the home countries to issue
the travel document.

additional arrivals, because for those un­
satisfied with the local economic condi­
tions even a temporary provision of food
and shelter combined with a small allow­
ance is an incentives to travel to the EU.
This creates further back logs in the sys­
tems, while for the migrants the most
likely consequence will be to stay ille­
gally in the EU.
The challenges to return are indeed
numerous, starting with the difficul­
ties to actually take into account in the
spontaneous return, out of any official
record, of a certain number of migrants
for whom a return decision has been is­
sued. However, data from detections of
illegal stay on exit do not show signif­
icant volume of detections. For exam­
ple, in the case of Kosovo*, 2 645 were
detected staying illegally while leaving
the EU in 2015.
Another challenge arising from
the data is that the number of return
­decisions largely depends on the leg­
islative framework and regulation of a
Member States. For example, the more
possibilities a person has to lodge appeal
procedure, the more likely the same per­
son can be notified several times a return
decision after one of the appeal proce­
dures has been rejected.
There are also numerous practical
challenges, in particular the difficul­
ties to obtain adequate travel document
from the Embassies of the origin coun­
tries. There are many constrains to this,
and among them is the fact that many
migrants have been registered in the EU

and Albania who, in 2015, were detected
at the border for illegal border-crossing
in large numbers, and who formed the
largest contingent of asylum applicants.
The concept of safe countries of origin
is distinct from the notion of safe third
country, which can be broadly defined
as a country of transit of an applicant
which is considered as capable of offering
him or her adequate protection against
persecution or serious harm. However,
this concept is not applied uniformly by
all EU Member States, some using it,
some referring to it but not applying it in
practice. In 2015, Hungary published an
official list of safe countries of origin and
safe third countries that includes Serbia.
It is on this basis that the returns of Syr­
ians were organised to Serbia.

EU safe countries of origin
The Commission is proposing a list of
safe countries of origin2 to facilitate the
use by all Member States of the proce­
dures to increase the overall efficiency of
their asylum system as concerns applica­
tions for international protection which
are likely to be unfounded. The initial EU
list designating as ‘safe’, includes Alba­
nia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the for­
mer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,
Kosovo*, Montenegro, Serbia, Turkey.
Among this list of safe countries, the
main impact on the border and on asy­
lum come from nationals from Kosovo*

with problems in obtaining the neces­
sary documentation from third coun­
tries’ consular authorities) and lack of
cooperation from the individual con­
cerned (s/he absconds).
Statistics also revealed stable annual
trends in decisions and effective returns,
and this stability is in stark contrast to
the high variability of other indicators
like detections of illegal border-cross­
ing. This stability is likely to be an indi­
cation of the limited resources Member
States have at their disposal to conduct
returns. Indeed, given the requirement
in terms of trained police-officers and
detentions, the number of effective re­
turns are strongly constrained. These
constrains do not enable to have a flex­
ible response to sudden and large num­
ber of return decisions.

Effective returns
With regard to the return of those with­
out the right to stay in the EU, statistics
demonstrate that there is a consider­
able gap between the persons issued
with a return decision (286 725 in 2015)
and those who, as a consequence, have
been subject to an effective return (ap­
proximately 158 345). There are multi­
ple reasons for this gap, including in
particular lack of cooperation from third
countries of origin or transit (e.g. linked

7. Looking ahead

Why develop scenarios?
Scenarios are created to form a basis for
an annual monitoring of changes in the
environment. Very different stakehold­
ers can make use of these scenarios to
develop their own internal strategies or
monitor how their internal strategies fit
a changing environment. Scenarios aim
at supporting strategic decision mak­
ers whose decisions will have middleto-long-term impacts so that they can
come up with realistic strategies which
are not focused on fixed expectations or
ideals about the future.
Indeed, in a dynamic and very com­
plex environment like irregular migra­
tion, it is difficult to develop reliable
forecasts based on past data. Similarly,
in the face of changes in the environ­
ment of border management, it is not
adequate to rely on trend analysis. Sce­
narios are thus a tool that can be used as
a foresight instrument at strategic level.

What kind of scenarios is
necessary?
One of the key objectives of the scenario
process is to foresee strategic changes as
early as possible, so that decision makers
at EU and Member State levels can pre­
pare, react or proactively decide. There­
fore, it is necessary to include in the
development of scenarios not only issues
related to border management, but also
to take into account its environment: in­
ternational migration and cross-border
crime, European actors and policies as
well as general developments from econ­

omy, society and geopolitics. Some of the
aspects of the scenarios cannot directly
be influenced by border-control author­
ities, including Frontex, but rather by
politics or society. For this reason, they
describe possible side-conditions for the
development of Frontex work and these
scenarios should therefore be interpreted
as ‘external scenarios’ in which Frontex
will develop its activities.

How have the scenarios been
developed?
These scenarios came up as the result
of an interactive team process, involving
experts from Frontex, Member States,
and the European Commission and from
other EU Agencies like Europol, EASO,
the Fundamental Rights Agency, the Eu­
ropean External Action Service (EEAS), as
well as from the OECD and the UN Ref­
ugee Agency (UNHCR).
The scenario team used the scenariomanagement approach, which is based
on four steps:
▪▪ Detection of key factors (Phase 1).
The building blocks of the scenarios
were gathered from the four-tier of
the border control access model and
resulted in the description of influ­
ence factors. Based on a systemic in­
terconnection analysis the dominant
drivers and those representing nods
have been worked out. The scenario
team selected 25 key factors for fur­
ther consideration.

▪▪ Foresight of alternative projections
(Phase 2). In the next step, possible
developments for all key factors have
been identified. These so-called ‘fu­
ture projections’ represent the three
to five alternative futures within the
next 5–10 years regarding each and
every single key factor. This time ref­
erence helped the participants to im­
agine the future beyond the current
events.
▪▪ Calculation and formulation of scenarios (Phase 3). Based on an assess­
ment of the consistencies between
all future projections, all possible
combinations have been checked by
a software. This led to seven possible
futures which have been analysed
and described. These scenarios rep­
resent the whole ‘window of possi­
bilities’ and are visualised in a ‘Map
of the future’.
▪▪ Scenario assessment and consequences (Phase 4). Finally the scenar­
ios have been assessed by the scenario
team so that the current status as well
as expected futures are examined. In
addition consequences of each sce­
nario for border management in gen­
eral and Frontex have been identified.

analysis of the core differences of these
scenarios showed the following main
drivers:
▪▪ European integration: Scenarios 1 to
4 include a stagnating or decreasing
political integration process in the
EU, while Scenarios 5 to 7 describe a
more harmonised development on a
political and societal level as well as
for border management.

Scenario 5

Scenario 1
Attrition of
European Union

Scenario 2

Constant side
conditions

Scenario 3
Managed Diversity

Scenario 4
Restrictive policies

Constant or reduced European integration

Multi-speed Europe

Less migration and
restrictive policies

▪▪ Global pressure: Scenarios 1, 2 and 7
refer mostly to situation of continu­
ous development of side-conditions,
Scenarios 3 to 6 describe a signifi­
cantly higher global pressure – and
due to that a more proactive Euro­
pean foreign policy and a stronger fo­
cus on border management.
▪▪ Level of migration: Scenarios 1,
3, 6 and 7 represent scenarios with
permissive migration policies and
a higher degree of migration while
Scenarios 2, 4 and 5 contain more re­
strictive policies and a lower degree
of migration.
Additional important drivers applying
to selected scenarios are the openness of
societies combined with a successful in­
tegration (Scenarios 3, 5, 6 and 7), a low
security orientation (Scenarios 1 and 7)
and stricter implementation of internal
border controls within the EU (Scenar­
ios 1 and 2).

Scenarios…
▪▪ describe alternative, possible futures (and not a single future);
▪▪ are based on the interconnection of the most important, long-term drivers
(and not on a few, currently dominating factors);
▪▪ describe side-conditions for border management activities in the future
(and not, what Frontex will, could or should do in the future);
▪▪ are a thinking tool for the next years (and a basis for a continuous assess­
ment within planning processes).
The scenarios describe external side-conditions for the management of the EU
external border within the next years. This means a set of possible scenarios
for the environment in which border management will act in the future. These
scenarios should cover all imaginable developments within the next 5–10 years
– but part of some scenarios may develop earlier. This wider focus of the scenar­
ios is set to support a continuous scenario assessment process within the next
years, monitoring which scenarios are actually prevailing.

Europe opens its arms and welcomes large numbers of migrants,

as a security problem, and Member

Scenario assessment: Expected development paths
The seven scenarios are initially ‘think­
ing tools’, without any assigned prob­
abilities. In this way, they are to be
considered to stimulate thinking and
a toll to identify little-used thinking
paths. For their use into specific strat­
egy and planning processes, it is nec­
essary to evaluate them in more detail.
The scenario team assessed the different
scenarios in two ways:
▪▪ Nearness to the current situation:
Scenario 2 (‘Passive European Union’)
was seen as the future image closest

to the current status. In addition, sce­
nario 4 (‘Restrictive policies’) included
a lot of topical elements. Scenario 7
(‘Open doors’) has the greatest dis­
tance to the current situation.
▪▪ Expectation for 2025: Three scenar­
ios have been assessed as the most
expected ones: Scenario 2 (‘Passive
European Union’), Scenario 4 (‘Re­
strictive policies’) and Scenario 5
(‘Multi-speed Europe’). Scenario 7
(‘Open doors’) has the greatest dis­

In general the scenario assessment
showed that the scenario team expected
a continuous development with restric­
tive policies and limitations of migration
– but within a stronger changing global
environment which forces the need for a
proactive European foreign policy and a
common European border management.

How to use the scenarios
These scenarios form a basis for an an­
nual monitoring of changes in the en­
vironment and to support strategic
decision makers whose decisions will
have middle to long-term impacts so that
they come to realistic strategies, which
are not focused on fixed expectations or
ideals about the future. The scenarios
could be used not just by Frontex, but
also by decision makers at the EU and
Member State levels. Therefore they may
be used for different objectives:
▪▪ Consequence analysis: Scenarios
could be used to analysing the ef­
fects of different possible futures on
an organisation. In this process, all
scenarios should be kept ‘in play’ for
as long as possible to also identify
the opportunities hidden in scenar­
ios perceived as negative and the of­

ten ignored dangers of superficially
‘good’ scenarios.
▪▪ Robustness check: Scenarios are like
‘long-term weather reports’ for a vi­
sion, a strategy or an action plan.
Therefore, existing concepts can be
reviewed in light of their potential
under different future possibilities.
In this manner, the risks of current
strategies become clearer. At the same
time, it becomes possible to detect
whether and how far existing con­
cepts are robust against changes in
the environment.
▪▪ Scenario-supported decision-making: How an organisation handle un­
certainty depends on how many and
which external scenarios are consid­
ered for strategic decisions. Options
range from focused strategies (fit to
one or a few scenarios) to robust strat­
egies (fit to many or all scenarios).

Less migration and
restrictive policies

Scenario 6

Open doors

More Europe

Stronger European
integration

Strong migration & open societies

Scenario 7

▪▪ Strategic early warning: Scenarios
are like ‘maps of the future’ – there­
fore, they should not be discarded af­
ter first use, but continue to be used.
This process of regular observation is
called scenario monitoring and this is
particular aspect will be followed-up
in future annual analysis, thus cre­
ating a reference platform of knowl­
edge for strategic decision makers in
the field of border management.
▪▪ Scenarios in change processes: Sce­
narios have also turned out to be an
important instrument in systematic
change processes. They clarify oppor­
tunities and needs for change as well
as one’s own options for action – and
they contribute to the openness of
managers and organisations towards
the future.

8. Conclusions
The EU external borders are confronted
with three major challenges: an unprec­
edented rise in migratory pressure, an
increasing terrorist threat and a steady
rise in the number of regular travellers.
The challenge for border-con­trol authori­
ties is thus to become more effective and
efficient whilst maintaining the neces­
sary quality standards.
Given the threats visible at the exter­
nal bor­ders of the EU, it is evident that
border man­agement has an important
security component. What useful func­
tion can be played by the border author­
ities in the area of counter-ter­rorism?
The threat of terrorist activi­ties and the
methods of entry into the EU have been
much discussed during the past year
due to several incidents which occurred
within the EU in 2014 and 2015. Delin­
eating the tasks and potential tools of
those working at the borders to help com­
bat this threat is an important discussion
which should be undertaken.
The corollary of the unprecedented
number of arrivals was the strain placed
on border-control authorities, which left
them with fewer resources available for
identifying those attempting to enter the
EU. This then resulted in high numbers
of entrants were not even attributed a
national­ity, let alone their identity thor­
oughly checked. The importance of this
issue is twofold; firstly, granting inter­
national protection to those in need is a
legal obligation. Hence, there is a strong
need to ensure the cor­rect and full iden­
tification of those arriving at the bor­
ders so as to provide the full nec­essary
protection, where required. Secondly,
the identification issue concerns the po­
tential threat to internal security. With
large num­bers of arrivals remaining es­
sentially unclas­sified for a variety of rea­
sons, there is clearly a risk that persons
representing a se­curity threat maybe en­
tering the EU.
Second-line checks on arrivals are a
crucial step in the identification process.
They also provide an important source of

information which can be further used
for intelligence and risk analysis pur­
poses. Improving intelligence and an­
alytical capacities is thus also of great
importance. The development of risk
profiles of arrivals and training for bor­
der guards in­volved in these fields would
also help to en­sure greater identification.
One improvement which has been
evident in the preceding years is the
increas­ing pool of sources of informa­
tion and data from the external border.
Information is key to situational moni­
toring and for analytical purposes and
so the improved availability of infor­
mation is of critical importance. How­
ever, with greater information comes
a greater challenge in utilising it effec­
tively. This is especially the case in emer­
gency sit­uations when large amounts
of information are available but time
is scarce. It is in this context that data
and situational informa­tion are some­
times not enough, but authori­ties will
require the analysis and intelligence de­
rived from them to make the fully in­
formed decisions. The management
of this knowl­edge process is critical.
Regular passenger flows across the
external border will also increase signif­
icantly in the com­ing years, in particu­
lar at the air border due to rising global
mobility. Visa liberalisation processes
and local border traf­fi c agreements are
also placing increasing re­sponsibility
on border-control authorities. Increas­
ingly, while movements across the ex­
ternal air borders are managed through
a layered approach, where the border is
divided into four tiers, the physical bor­
der is increasingly becoming a second­
ary layer for risk assessment, meaning
that checking and screening start well
before passengers cross border-control
posts at airports. Border management
will increasingly be risk-based, to en­
sure that interventions are focused on
high-risk movements of people, while
low-risk movements are facilitated
smoothly.

Notes on FRAN data sources and methods
The term Member States refers to FRAN
Member States, which includes the 28
Member States and the three Schengen
Associated Countries (Iceland, Norway
and Switzerland). For the data concern­
ing detections at the external borders of
the EU, some of the border types are not
applicable to all FRAN Member States.
This pertains to data on all FRAN in­
dicators since the data are provided
disaggregated by border type. The def­
initions of detections at land borders
are therefore not applicable (excluding
borders with non- Schengen principal­
ities) for Belgium, the Czech Republic,
Denmark, France, Germany, Iceland,
Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the
Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, Swit­
zerland and the UK. For Cyprus, the
land border refers to the Green Line
demarcation with the area where the
Government of the Republic of Cyprus
does not exercise effective control. For
sea borders, the definitions are not ap­
plicable for land-locked Member States
including Austria, the Czech Republic,
Hungary, Luxembourg, Slovakia and
Switzerland.

Frontex · Risk Analysis for 2016

In addition, data on detections of il­
legal border-crossing at land, air and
sea BCPs (1B) are not available for Ice­
land, Ireland and Spain, and in Greece
these detections are included in the
data for indicator 1A. Data for Norway
only include detections of illegal bor­
der-crossing at land and sea BCPs (1B),
not between BCPs (1A).
Data on detections of illegal bordercrossing between sea BCPs (1A) are not
available for Ireland. For 2013, data from
Slovenia include detections at the EU ex­
ternal borders only until June 2013. Data
from Spain at the land border with Mo­
rocco have been revised by reporting only
detections of persons crossing the bor­
der irregularly by climbing the fence.
Data on apprehension (FRAN Indi­
cator 2) of facilitators are not available
for Ireland and UK. For Italy, the data
are not disaggregated by border type,
but are reported as total apprehensions
(not specified). Data for Italy and Nor­
way also include the facilitation of ille­
gal stay and work. For Romania, the data
include land Intra-EU detections on exit
at the border with Hungary.

For the data concerning detections
of illegal stay (FRAN Indicator 3), data
on detections on exit are not available
for Denmark, Ireland, Italy and the UK.
Data on detections of illegal stay inland
have not been available from the Neth­
erlands since 2012. Data from Sweden
for Illegal stay have been revised start­
ing with 2010.
Data on refusals of entry (FRAN In­
dicator 4) at the external EU borders are
not disaggregated by reason of refusal
for Ireland and the UK.
The data on passenger flow (shared
on voluntary basis) are not available
for Austria, Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, It­
aly, Malta, Sweden and the UK. Data
on passenger flow at the air border are
not available according to the definition
for Spain. Data at the sea border are not
available for Spain, the Netherlands, Ro­
mania and Denmark.
For all indicators, data from Croatia
are available only starting with July 2013.
