Frontex official publications fall into four main categories: risk analysis, training,
operations and research, each marked with a distinct graphic identifier. Risk analysis
publications bear a triangular symbol formed by an arrow drawing a triangle, with a
dot at the centre. Metaphorically, the arrow represents the cyclical nature of risk
analysis processes and its orientation towards an appropriate operational response.
The triangle is a symbol of ideal proportions and knowledge, reflecting the pursuit of
factual exactness, truth and exhaustive analysis. The dot at the centre represents the
intelligence factor and the focal point where information from diverse sources converges
to be processed, systematised and shared as analytical products. Thus, Frontex risk
analysis is meant to be at the centre and to form a reliable basis for its operational
activities.

Introduction
As of January 2016, three new countries
joined the Eastern Borders Risk Analysis
Network (EB-RAN) operating under the
EU-funded Eastern Partnership Integrated
Border Management Capacity Building
Project: Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia. Upon this extension, the network has
been renamed as the Eastern Partnership
Risk Analysis Network (EaP-RAN).

impact the regional and common borders while the quarterly reports are meant
to provide regular updates and identify
emerging trends in order to maintain situational awareness. Both types of reports
are aimed at offering support for strategic
and operational decision making.

Concept

The Eastern Partnership Quarterly statistical overview is focused on quarterly developments for the seven key indicators of
irregular migration: (1) detections of illegal border-crossing between BCPs; (2) detections of illegal border-crossing at BCPs;
(3) refusals of entry; (4) detections of illegal stay; (5) asylum applications; (6) detections of facilitators; and (7) detections
of fraudulent documents.1

The Eastern Partnership Risk Analysis
Network (EaP-RAN) performs monthly
exchanges of statistical data and information on the most recent irregular migration trends. This information is compiled
at the level of the Frontex Risk Analysis
Unit (RAU) and analysed in cooperation
with the regional partners on a quarterly
and annual basis. The annual reports offer a more in-depth analysis of the occurring developments and phenomena which

Methodology

of the EaP-RAN (Armenia2, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine) and
reference period statistics from common
border sections of the neighbouring EU
Member States and Schengen Associated
Countries (Norway, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary
and Romania). The data are processed,
checked for errors and merged into an Excel database for further analysis.

Structure
The general Situational overview is broken down by main areas of work of border-control authorities and police activities
related to irregular migration. The current
issue of the Eastern Partnership Risk Analysis Network Quarterly is the first following the extension of the network with
new members.

The backbone of this overview are monthly
statistics provided within the framework

Illegal border-crossing

Figure 1. Detections of illegal border-crossing between BCPs reported by EaP-RAN
members at all borders show that the highest pressure in Q1 2016 was recorded at
the Ukrainian borders with Moldova and the Russian Federation. The HungarianUkrainian and Polish-Belarusian border sections were the most affected common
borders.

In the first quarter of 2016, 840 cases
of illegal border-crossing between BCPs
were reported by the Eastern Partnership Risk Analysis Network (EaP-RAN) Detections of illegal border-crossing between BCPs at all borders covered by the EaP-RAN in Q1 2016

Irregular migration was the main reason
for crossing the border illegally both for
Afghans and Vietnamese.

Among the Ukrainians, Moldovans and
Russian detected illegally crossing the border in Q1 2016, over 82% of the cases were
linked either to smuggling or to other reasons unrelated to migration.

relation to the same quarter of 2015. The
most significant drop was related to Afghans, Vietnamese and Iraqis. The growth
was observed for Turkish nationals.
At the Eastern Partnership and external
borders1, 325 cases of illegal border-crossing were reported. Over 75% of detections
took place at Ukrainian borders, mostly involving regional nationals, i.e. Ukrainians
and Moldovans. Most of the non-regional
migrants detected came from Bangladesh
and Sri Lanka.

Facilitators

Pakistani organising smuggling of irregular migrants detained in Odessa

The number of facilitators detected at the
common borders almost quadrupled in the
first quarter of 2016 compared with the final quarter of 2015 (from 47 in Q4 2015 to
206 in Q1 2016) and was 289% higher than
in the same period of 2015 (53 in Q1 2015).

The staff of Operational Search Sub-departments of Mukachevo and Odessa Border Detachments of the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine, in cooperation with
the representatives of the Interior Security Department of National Police, apprehended a citizen of Pakistan organising smuggling of migrants through the state
border of Ukraine in the Zakarpattia region. He was involved in at least three illegal transportations of the migrants to Hungary and Romania.
Source: www.ua-reporter.com, 16 January 2016

The peak in detections can be explained
by high number of detections reported
by Finland that were linked with irregular migration on the Arctic route from
the Russian Federation to Finland. Top
five nationalities reported by Finland were
Afghans, Indians, Cameroonians, Pakistanis and Bangladeshi, while facilitators
reported within the EaP-RAN were mostly
citizens of the countries of the region, led
by Russians followed by Ukrainians and
Belarusians.

Refusals of entry
There were 19 293 of refusals of entry reported during the first 2016 within the
Eastern Partnership Risk Analysis Network
Members.1 The vast majority of refusals
(89%) was reported at land borders, mostly
issued by Poland and Belarus. Citizens of
Ukraine, the Russian Federation, Moldova,
Belarus and Azerbaijan accounted for the
most refused entries.
At the common borders, refusals of entry issued by the EU Member States and
Schengen Associated Countries dropped
by almost 5% when compared with Q4
2015 and increased by 30% in relation to
the same period of 2015. A significant number was reported by Poland with Ukrainian citizens as prevailing nationals refused
entry to Poland.
At the Eastern Partnership and external
borders, in turn, 8 743 refusals were reported, with respectively 68% and 20%
issued at land and air borders. Belarus,
Ukraine and Georgia issued the majority of refusals.

made by Ukraine.
In terms of nationalities, Ukrainians and
Moldovans were the most frequently detected among fraudulent document users. The vast majority of commonly used
fraudulent documents were passports.

Situation in the Eastern Partnership region

Illegal stay in EaP-RAN countries

In the first quarter of 2016 there were
5 318 detections of illegal stay reported by
Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and
Ukraine. The top five detected nationalities
included Russians, Ukrainians, Moldovans,
Azerbaijanis and Georgians. Citizens of the
Russian Federation, and Azerbaijan were
mostly detected by Ukraine, while Ukrain-

ians, Georgians and Moldovans tended to
be reported by Belarus.
Almost 99% of detections of illegal stay were
reported on exit. The Ukrainian borders
with Belarus and the Russian Federation
were the most affected ones, followed by
Belarusian, Ukrainian and Georgian airports.

14 Vietnamese staying illegally in Ukraine were detected in an underground

In March 2016, the staff of the State Border Guard Service together with the officials of the Public Prosecutor’s Office disclosed an underground workshop in the
Odessa region, where migrants from Vietnam sewed clothes. The migrants had to
work in the workshop to pay off the facilitation fees before the organisers of irregular migration would take them to EU Member States. 14 citizens of Vietnam with
no documents were detected during the search.

In Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine only (reporting countries in previous quarters) detections of illegal stay in Q1 2016 shows
a decrease of 25% compared to the final
quarter of 2015 and by 10% versus the corresponding quarter of 2015. The drop was
related mostly to a decreasing number of
Russians detected for illegal stay on exit.
Intensified patrols in Moscow
aimed at a growing number of
migrants illegally staying in the
Russian Federation
In the first quarter of 2016, the Federal
Migration Service (FMS) began patrolling the transportation hubs near the
busiest subway stations in the Moscow
region. The purpose of these actions
was the identification of migrants illegally staying in the Russian Federation. The patrolling was supported
with specially equipped vehicles that
enabled quick access to FMS databases
to verify the legality of stay and fingerprint registration of a foreign citizen.
According to the FMS’s press service,
these measures were undertaken in order to put the current migration legislation in practice. Nevertheless, it
cannot be excluded that the strengthening of the measures is connected
with a growing number of foreigners illegally staying and working in the Russian Federation without a stay or work
permit. According to FMS statistics, the
number of permits for migrant workers in the Russian Federation (stay and
work permits) decreased significantly
by 44% in 2015 in relation to 2014 and
in the first two months of 2016 it was
five times lower than in the same period in 2015.
