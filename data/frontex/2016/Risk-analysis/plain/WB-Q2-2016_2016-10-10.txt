Frontex official publications fall into four main categories: risk analysis, training,
operations and research, each marked with a distinct graphic identifier. Risk analysis
publications bear a triangular symbol formed by an arrow drawing a triangle, with
a dot at the centre. Metaphorically, the arrow represents the cyclical nature of risk
analysis processes and its orientation towards an appropriate operational response.
The triangle is a symbol of ideal proportions and knowledge, reflecting the pursuit
of factual exactness, truth and exhaustive analysis. The dot at the centre represents
the intelligence factor and the focal point where information from diverse sources
converges to be processed, systematised and shared as analytical products. Thus,
Frontex risk analysis is meant to be at the centre and to form a reliable basis for its
operational activities.

Introduction

Concept
The Western Balkans Risk Analysis Network (WB-RAN) performs monthly exchanges of statistical data and information
on the most recent irregular migration
developments affecting the region. This
information is compiled at Frontex Risk
Analysis Unit (RAU) level and analysed in
cooperation with the regional partners on
a quarterly and annual basis. The annual
reports offer a more in-depth analysis of
the developments and phenomena which
impact the regional and common borders, while the quarterly reports are meant
to provide regular updates and identify
emerging trends in order to maintain situational awareness. Both types of reports
are aimed at offering support for strategic
and operational decision making.

Methodology
The Western Balkans Quarterly is focused
on quarterly developments as reflected by
the seven key indicators of irregular migration: (1) detections of illegal bordercrossing between BCPs, (2) detections of
illegal border-crossing at BCPs, (3) refusals of entry, (4) detections of illegal stay,
(5) asylum applications, (6) detections of
facilitators, and (7) detections of fraudulent documents.1

1

The data presented in the overview are
derived from monthly statistics provided
within the framework of the WB-RAN
and reference-period statistics from common border sections of neighbouring EU
Member States (Croatia, Bulgaria, Greece,
Hungary and Romania). In addition, the
Western Balkans Quarterly is drawing
from FRAN Quarterly reports and also
from data analysed in the framework
of other risk analysis networks (FRAN,
EDF-RAN).

Structure
The first part offers a general situational
overview broken down by main areas of
work of border-control authorities and
police activities related to irregular migration. The second part presents more indepth featured risk analyses of particular
phenomena.
Changes in data scope after Croatia’s
entry to the EU
Important changes in the collection and
use of data for Western Balkans Quarterlies were introduced upon Croatia’s joining
the EU in July 2013. Firstly, data for Slovenia, which now has no external borders
with non-EU Western Balkan countries,
have not been included in the report since
the third quarter of 2013. Slovenian histor-

ical data were also excluded from the tables in order to make the comparison with
previous quarters analytically meaningful.
Secondly, as the Croatian-Hungarian and
Croatian-Slovenian border sections are
now internal EU-borders and so they are
no longer covered by this report.
Thirdly, after joining the EU, Croatian data
on illegal stay data are limited to detections at the border. More precisely, Croatia’s illegal stay data only include cases
detected on exit, while inland detections
are not included. The analysis of the illegal stay indicator takes this fact into
consideration.
Changes in data scope after Kosovo*’s
entry to the WB-RAN
Starting from the first quarter of 2014,
data from Kosovo* on key indicators of
irregular migration have been included in
the reporting, making it possible to get a
more comprehensive picture of the irregular movements in the region. However,
as there are no historical data available for
Kosovo*, the new data have some impact
on the comparison of the examined period
with previous quarters. When necessary
for analytical purposes, some comparison
can be made also excluding data from Kosovo*, which is noted in the text.

Please note that the analysis of this indicator
is now limited to WB-RAN countries
only, given that EU Member States have
transitioned to the European Union
Document-Fraud (EDF) reporting scheme.

Situation at the border

Border surveillance
Illegal border-crossings
During the analysed period, 26 488 illegal border-crossings by non-regional migrants on route from Turkey, Greece and
Bulgaria were reported at the common
and regional borders (see Fig. 2). This represents an 88% drop over the previous
quarter and a return to a level slightly
above that of Q1 2015, i.e. before the migratory crisis started to affect the Western Balkans.

der between the former Yugoslav Republic
of Macedonia and Greece. This rise largely
corresponded with the Greek authorities’
efforts to transfer migrants gathered in
the border area to official reception centres. It also coincided with enhanced control measures implemented in the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. 2 Regardless of the increase, May 2016 fell short of
any of the monthly levels observed be2

The month of May was marked by a slight
increase in detections, mainly at the bor-

tween April 2015 and March 2016 and the
decreasing trend observed in Q1 continued.
At the same time, 2 300 of the illegal
border-crossings reported in the Western
Balkans in Q2 2016 were associated with
regional migrants.

In 2016 Q2, Afghans became the top reported nationality, accounting for a 36%
share of the total non-regional migration
flow, while Syrians dropped to the second
place with a shrinking 16% contribution. A
number of migrants continued being reported as ‘unknown’ but their overall share
of the non-regional total dropped from 51%
in Q1 to 20% in Q2.
Pakistanis were the third most reported
nationality, followed by Iraqis, Iranians
and Turks, who replaced Moroccans on
the sixth place. With the exception of Pakistanis and Turks, all of these top seven
nationalities registered significant drops
from the previous quarter.
The number of detections of Western Balkan regional migrants was 7% lower compared with the previous quarter but due
to the decline in non-regional migrants
it represented 8% of the overall flow affecting the region (compared with less
than 1% in Q1).
Interestingly, Q2 2016 represented the lowest second quarter in terms of regional
migrants detected while illegally crossing between BCPs since Q2 2011.
Despite the overall decrease, the majority of
Western Balkan country nationals detected
for illegal border-crossing continued being reported at the Greek-Albanian border (almost
exclusively Albanians). The second busiest border was the Hungarian-Serbian section, which
accounted for 8% of the regional flow, mostly
consisting of Kosovo* citizens.

During the second quarter of 2016, there
were 307 detected facilitators, representing an 18% increase over the previous
three month period.
The reported rise in detected facilitators
is not surprising and can be expected to
continue, especially after the closure of
the transit corridor in March and the implementation of additional border-control measures. Specifically, as migrants
can no longer rely on the transportation services provided by the authorities
and need to bypass additional preventive measures, their demand for facilitation services will likely increase. The rising
demand will make the human smuggling

region, the border between the former

of non-regional migrants trying to
enter the Western Balkans, followed
by the Bulgarian-Serbian border. In the
northern part, the Hungarian-Serbian

the region, outranking the CroatianSerbian section, where the numbers
dropped significantly after the closure
of the transit corridor. The regional flow
was still mainly concentrated at the

more profitable, probably increasing the
number of persons engaging in this type
of criminal activity.
Nevertheless, the fact that in Q2 the number of illegal border-crossings involving
non-regional nationals was more than
26 400 with only 307 facilitators detected
indicates that migrants still possess a certain ability to self-organise, even after
the transit corridor became unavailable.

As regards nationalities, 73% of all facilitators detected in the analysed quarter
were nationals of Western Balkan countries, 17% were citizens of EU Member
States (especially those neighbouring the
region), and 10% were nationals of third
countries from outside the region or ‘unknown’. The highest share of detections
was still reported by Serbia, followed by
Greece.

Border checks
Clandestine entries

in Q2 2016 Albanian and Kosovo* citizens
continued to rank first amongst false document users, accounting for 54% and 16%
of all detections, respectively.

In Q2 2016, a total of 244 non-regional
migrants were detected while attempting to illegally cross the border hiding in
vehicles. This represents a 37% decrease
compared to the previous quarter and a
24% decrease compared to Q2 2015. Most
clandestine non-regionals were reported
by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Serbia and Hungary, mostly at their
respective southern borders. Additionally,
60 nationals of Western Balkan countries
were reported at BCPs, especially at the
Greek-Albanian border.

Passports, ID cards and residence permits
were the most commonly used false documents. Unsurprisingly, the large majority
of ID cards were EU Member States’ documents, as they can be used to move freely
within the Schengen area and the EU.
As far as detections of false passports are
concerned, the majority were reportedly
issued by countries from the region. The
majority of these documents were Albanian, by and large used by Albanian nationals most likely in an attempt to avoid
entry bans imposed for prior misuse of
visa liberalisation.

Document fraud
During the second quarter, there were
170 cases of false document use reported
by the six Western Balkan countries, a
number 28% lower than that of the previous quarter.
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ranked first in terms of detections of
fraudulent documents, followed by Serbia and Albania. As regards nationalities,

trends related to higher tourist mobility
in the spring months: the number of issued
refusals was comparable with that of the
corresponding quarter of 2015. Turkish nationals ranked fourth among the refused
nationalities thus occupying a top position
for the fourth consecutive quarter despite
a 40% reduction compared to Q1.
As usual, a large majority of refusals of
entry were issued at land borders (94%),
while the remaining 6% were mainly reported at air borders.

Refusals of entry

Most of the refusals reported by the neighbouring EU Member States were issued
to nationals of Western Balkan countries
(94%). In turn, among those refused entry by the six countries of the region, 38%
were local residents, 28% were nationals of
EU Member States / Schengen Associated
Countries and 12% were Turkish nationals.

In the analysed period, the number of refusals of entry increased by 14% compared
with the previous quarter: from roughly
8 800 to 10 000. This rise appears to be
largely consistent with usual seasonal

The overall number of refusals issued to
the non-regional nationalities associated
with the migratory flow originating from
Turkey / Greece continued to represent a
low share of the total.

Figure 6. Despite consecutive reductions, Turkish nationals continue to rank high among the top refused nationalities, indicating

Situation in the Western Balkans

Illegal stay in Western Balkan countries
In Q2 2016, there were 862 detections
of illegal stay reported by the six Western Balkan countries. This is 3% higher
than in the previous quarter, yet still low
considering the overall size of the flow
transiting the region in the recent period. In relation to the corresponding
quarter of 2015, the detections of illegally staying persons registered a minor
decrease (-3%).
During the analysed quarter, Serbian and
Albanian nationals continued to rank first
and second, respectively, among detected
illegal stayers. Citizens of Serbia were
mainly reported by Montenegro and, to
a lesser extent, by Bosnia and Herzegovina, while Albanians tended to illegally

stay in the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia.
Turkish nationals ranked third among the
detected illegal stayers and were mostly
reported by Bosnia-Herzegovina and, to
a lesser extent, by Albania and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
Nationals of Bosnia and Herzegovina
ranked fourth during the second quarter
and were mainly reported by Montenegro and Serbia.
As in the previous quarters, very few of
those who have transited Turkey / Greece
before reaching the Western Balkans were
later detected illegally staying in the six
countries of the region.

The large discrepancy over the past few
quarters between the number of detected
illegal border-crossings by non-regional
migrants coming via Greece / Turkey reported by the six Western Balkan countries and the discovered illegal stayers of
corresponding nationalities indicates that
the region is mainly regarded as a transit area. Nevertheless, as new restriction measures (described in the Featured
Analysis overleaf) will make leaving the
Western Balkans more difficult it can be
expected that the number of either illegal
stayers or protection applicants associated with the transiting flow will increase
in the future.

Figure 7. Only a small share of non-regional nationalities reported for illegal border-crossing are detected as illegal stayers
(indicating that the Western Balkans remains a transit area)

Closure of the corridor and
enhanced controls lead to
further decrease in the nonregional migration flow
Greater coordination of
border-control measures
reduced the flow transiting
the Western Balkans

Developments which
impacted and could further
impact the migratory flow in
Q2 and afterwards

The need for a coordinated approach to
the migration crisis affecting the Western Balkans brought about several highlevel meetings of regional and EU Member
States’ officials at the beginning of 2016.

Tightened control and prevention
measures in the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia

Each meeting resulted in gradual transit
restrictions at regional level culminating
on 9 March with the complete closure of
the Western Balkan transit corridor and
the return to the full application of the
Schengen Borders Code and legislation
governing international travel.
The coordinated restriction measures and
the ultimate return to the normal application of border legislation in the Western
Balkans and in neighbouring EU Member
States greatly reduced the migratory flow
transiting the region.
Specifically, the number of detected illegal border-crossings at regional level decreased almost every month from 128 000
in January to less than 7 000 in June 2016.
This drop brought the total number of
detections reported during the second
quarter close to the level registered back
in Q1 2015, before the crisis started seriously affecting the region.

Given its geographical position, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was
a key player in all the coordinated measures agreed and implemented at regional
level for the reduction of the unprecedented migratory flow. These measures
began back in November 2015 with activities meant to filter the flow (i.e. only
Syrians, Iraqis and Afghans were allowed
passage), continued throughout February 2016 and culminated in March, when
the transit corridor was effectively closed.
In order to cope with high numbers of refused persons trying to force their way
from Greece, the authorities in Skopje increased the presence of police forces on
their southern border while also erecting a
two-layer fence planned to cover the most
sensitive areas. As the success of any coordinated restrictions greatly depended
on the capacity to properly prevent entries across the border between the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and
Greece, more regional and EU Member
States sent reinforcements to this area
(based on bilateral agreements).

wb-ran · q2 2016

Although a number of migrants may be allowed to enter on humanitarian grounds
and others still manage to pass undetected, the flow is greatly reduced by the
effective measures in place.
Legislation amendments in Hungary
During the second quarter, despite the preventive measures at the southern common borders with Greece and Bulgaria, a
number of migrants still managed to trickle
through the region undetected. These persons were afterwards largely reported at
Hungary’s border with Serbia, while the
Croatian-Serbian border section only registered very low numbers after the closure
of the transit corridor in March.
In reaction to this situation, on 5 July 2016,
Hungary implemented a new law permitting the authorities to escort all migrants
detected in its territory within 8 kilometres from the Serbian border to dedicated
transit zones. This approach led to a quick
decrease in the number of migrants who
were able to move on towards their des-

Similar deflections occurred towards Croatia in September 2015, when Hungary
erected a physical obstacle on its border
with Serbia and amended its legislation,
but the scale of this phenomenon mainly
resulted from factors which are no longer
present today (extremely high flow in the
Greek islands and organised transportation
being provided to the migrants).
Strengthened control activities in
Serbia
As it lays on the path between Greece/Bulgaria and Western Europe, Serbia remained
the top transit country for non-regional
migrants moving on the Western Balkan
route in the second quarter.

Trying to cope with this situation, the Serbian authorities have implemented a series of measures designed to tackle human
smuggling, enhance detection capacities
and deter illegal entries.
At the end of May, mixed police check
points (local, national and border police)
were set up on the main intersections
of the roads leading from the borders.
This was envisioned as an additional layer
of control to detect those migrants who
managed to cross the border and were
moving within the territory.
Moreover, towards the end of July the authorities in Belgrade decided to further
strengthen their border-control activities
in the south. In this regard, a special operation was launched in which mixed military and police patrols were deployed at

Specifically, although the migratory pressure on the border between Greece and
the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia remains high with migrants trying to
cross every day the great majority of such
attempts are actually prevented with the
help of enhanced police presence.

This new measure could have a number
of outcomes, ranging from a deterrence
effect further discouraging arrivals in the
region, to a slow accumulation of pressure within Serbia. It may also produce
certain flow deflections towards other
border sections.

Specifically, as it happened in the past,
migrants who decided to travel overland
from Turkey / Greece towards their Western European destinations almost invariably entered Serbia across its southern
borders with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia or Bulgaria before moving
north to attempt an exit, mostly towards
Hungary and currently, to a lesser extent,
also towards Croatia.

Available information indicates that this
measure helped prevent a significant number of migrants from entering the region
since the moment it was put in place.

tinations after entering Hungary. Thus,
even though operational information indicates that some migrants still attempt
the crossing on a daily basis, only few actually manage to continue their journey.

As part of the reinforcement, Project ‘Special Measure Supporting the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to Manage
its Southern Border in the Context of the
European Migration Crisis’ was rolled out
in April with the support of the European
Commission and IOM. Under this project, additional police officers and equipment from several regional countries and
EU Member States started patrolling the
border alongside local personnel.

Greece and Bulgaria continued at relatively low levels.

Developments at the EU external
borders with Turkey

Even after the attempted military coup
of 15 July and subsequent investigations
in the state apparatus of Turkey no dramatic developments have been observed
in terms of the authorities’ capacity to cooperate with the EU, or in terms of swift
increase of migratory pressure on the external borders.

The flow of migrants reaching the Aegean
Islands has significantly decreased after
the Western Balkans transit corridor was
closed and the EU-Turkey statement on
limiting irregular migration entered into
force in March. Similarly, the number of
crossings at Turkey’s land borders with

It may be worth noticing that operational
data indicate a slight increase in the number of arrivals on the Greek islands between weeks 28 and 31.
No links can yet be established between
this slight rise and Turkey’s ability to
prevent departures; however, precaution dictates that enhanced border-control measures in the Eastern Aegean and
the Western Balkans be maintained as
a means of pre-empting any negative
developments.
