Frontex official publications fall into four main categories: risk analysis, training,
operations and research, each marked with a distinct graphic identifier. Risk analysis
publications bear a triangular symbol formed by an arrow drawing a triangle, with
a dot at the centre. Metaphorically, the arrow represents the cyclical nature of risk
analysis processes and its orientation towards an appropriate operational response.
The triangle is a symbol of ideal proportions and knowledge, reflecting the pursuit
of factual exactness, truth and exhaustive analysis. The dot at the centre represents
the intelligence factor and the focal point where information from diverse sources
converges to be processed, systematised and shared as analytical products. Thus,
Frontex risk analysis is meant to be at the centre and to form a reliable basis for its
operational activities.

Introduction

Concept
The Western Balkans Risk Analysis Network (WB-RAN) performs monthly exchanges of statistical data and information
on the most recent irregular migration
developments affecting the region. This
information is compiled at Frontex Risk
Analysis Unit (RAU) level and analysed in
cooperation with the regional partners on
a quarterly and annual basis. The annual
reports offer a more in-depth analysis of
the developments and phenomena which
impact the regional and common borders, while the quarterly reports are meant
to provide regular updates and identify
emerging trends in order to maintain situational awareness. Both types of reports
are aimed at offering support for strategic
and operational decision making.

Methodology
The Western Balkans Quarterly is focused
on quarterly developments as reflected by
the seven key indicators of irregular migration: (1) detections of illegal bordercrossing between BCPs, (2) detections of
illegal border-crossing at BCPs, (3) refusals of entry, (4) detections of illegal stay,
(5) asylum applications, (6) detections of
facilitators, and (7) detections of fraudulent documents.1

1

Please note that the analysis of this indicator
is now limited to WB-RAN countries
only, given that EU Member States have
transitioned to the European Union
Document-Fraud (EDF) reporting scheme.

The data presented in the overview are
derived from monthly statistics provided
within the framework of the WB-RAN
and reference period statistics from common border sections of neighbouring EU
Member States (Croatia, Bulgaria, Greece,
Hungary and Romania). In addition, the
Western Balkans Quarterly is drawing from
FRAN Quarterly reports and also from
data analysed in the framework of other
risk analysis networks (FRAN, EDF-RAN).

Structure
The first part offers a general situational
overview broken down by main areas of
work of border-control authorities and police activities related to irregular migration.
The second part presents more in-depth
featured risk analyses of particular phenomena. As the current issue of the Western Balkans Quarterly is the fourth following
a new approach adopted for risk analysis quarterlies, the structure of the report
may still be subject to some readjustments.
Changes in data scope after Croatia’s
entry to the EU
Important changes in the collection and
use of data for Western Balkans Quarterly
were introduced upon Croatia’s joining the
EU in July 2013. Firstly, data for Slovenia,
which now has no external borders with
non-EU Western Balkan countries, have
not been included in the report since the

third quarter of 2013. Slovenian historical
data were also excluded from the tables
in order to make the comparison with
previous quarters analytically meaningful.
Secondly, as the Croatian-Hungarian and
Croatian-Slovenian border sections are
now internal EU borders and so they are
no longer covered by this report.
Thirdly, after joining the EU, Croatian data
on illegal stay data are limited to detections at the border. More precisely, Croatia’s illegal stay data only include cases
detected on exit, while inland detections
are not included. The analysis of the illegal stay indicator takes this fact into
consideration.
Changes in data scope after Kosovo*’s
entry to the WB-RAN
Starting from the first quarter of 2014 data
from Kosovo* on key indicators of irregular migration have been included in the
reporting, making it possible to get a more
comprehensive picture of the irregular
movements in the region. However, as
there are no historical data available for
Kosovo*, the new data have some impact
on the comparison of the examined period
with previous quarters. When necessary
for analytical purposes, some comparison can be made also excluding data from
Kosovo.*

Situational

Situation at the border

Border surveillance
Illegal border-crossings
During the analysed period, over 1.3 million illegal border-crossings by non-regional migrants en route from Turkey,
Greece and Bulgaria were reported at the
common and regional borders (Fig. 2). This
represents an over twofold increase compared to the previous quarter, which was
already an all-time record. Unsurprisingly,
the sheer volume of the flow (at times
reaching more than 12 000 persons per
day) continued to overwhelm border-control authorities, as the procedures and
legal framework currently in place are
not designed for such large flows. At the

same time, less than 1% of the illegal border-crossings in the Western Balkans in
Q4 2015 were associated with regional
migrants.

‘unknown’2 (the number of such cases reported in Q4 was more than twice that of
Q3 2015 and accounted for roughly 40% of
the non-regional total).

Syrians and Afghans remained the two
main nationalities, both registering high
increases compared with the previous
quarter (approx. twofold and threefold
rise, respectively). Despite this high increases their respective shares of the total non-regional migration flow (32% and
16%, respectively) remained similar to the
previous period, mainly due to a very high
number of migrants still being reported as

Iraqi migrants continued to be the third
most detected nationality, followed by
Iranians, Pakistanis and Moroccans. All of
these nationalities registered significant
shifts from the previous quarter, ranging
from a multiple increase for Iraqis, Iranians and Moroccans to a 60% drop in the
case of Pakistanis.

Figure 2. The non-regional flow continues to enter the Western Balkans region
through the southern common borders and then exit in its northern part, mostly
across the Croatian-Serbian border (after the Hungarian-Serbian green border was
sealed in mid-September)

The surge in illegal border-crossings involving Iranians could be attributed to better
flow-filtering capacities implemented by
the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Serbia. The observed drop in detected Pakistanis is somewhat surprising
given a high rising trend of this nationality
in previous months. However, as it largely
coincides with the introduction of transit
restrictions limiting the flow to Syrians,
Iraqis and Afghans, this reported drop may
indicate that Pakistanis manage to pass
undetected by swapping their nationality.
Together, these top five nationalities accounted for 59% of the non-regional migration flow between BCPs reported from
all border sections, while the nationality
of almost 40% of persons was reported
as ‘unknown’.
The detections of Western Balkan regional migrants remained broadly similar
to the previous quarter and only represented less than 1% of the overall flow
affecting the region. The vast majority
(77%) of Western Balkan country nationals detected for illegal border-crossing
were reported at the Greek-Albanian border, mainly as part of Albanian circular
migration.
2 The number of persons reported as unknown
is analysed as part of the non-regional
migration flow.

point of exit from the region, after the
Hungarian-Serbian section was sealed
in mid-September. The regional flow
was still mainly restricted to the GreekAlbanian border

Facilitators
During the fourth quarter of 2015, the
number of facilitators was 273, representing an important 56% decrease compared
with the previous three-month period and
reaching the lowest number of such detections since Q3 2014. Considering the over
twofold rise in the number of reported illegal border-crossings involving non-regional nationals, the very low number of
facilitators indicates that migrants are increasingly able to self-organise and/or rely
on authorities when it comes to travel arrangements for transiting the region.

* This designation is without prejudice to positions on status, and is in line with
UNSCR 1244 and the ICJ Opinion on the Kosovo declaration of independence.

Source: WB-RAN and FRAN data as of 4 February 2016

As regards nationalities, 64% of all facilitators detected in the analysed quarter were
nationals of Western Balkan countries, 29%
were citizens of the neighbouring EU Member States and 6% were nationals of third
countries from outside the region or ‘unknown’. The highest share of detections was

still reported by Serbia (43%), mostly Serbian nationals, followed by Bulgaria (23%).
Importantly, another quarterly increase in
detected facilitators was reported by Bulgaria at its border with Serbia (11% more than
in Q3), which is in line with the increasing
number of migrants targeting this section.

users, accounting for 50% of all detections,
followed by Kosovo* and Serbian citizens.

In Q4 2015, a total of 38 non-regional migrants were detected while attempting to
illegally cross the border hiding in vehicles.
This is the lowest quarterly number since
data collection began, which indicates that
migrants successfully crossed the borders
relying on the policies facilitating their
transit. Additionally, only 114 nationals of
Western Balkan countries were reported
at BCPs, mostly Albanians reported at the
Greek–Albanian border section.

Passports, ID cards and border stamps
were still the most commonly used false
documents. Unsurprisingly, the large majority of ID cards (33 out of 37) were EU
Member States’ documents, as they can
be used to move freely within the Schengen area and the EU.
As far as detections of false passports are
concerned, the majority (93) were reportedly issued by countries from the region.
The majority of these documents were Albanian (66), mostly used by Albanian nationals (66) who attempted to avoid entry
bans imposed in connection to their misuse of visa liberalisation.

Document fraud
During the fourth quarter, there were 220
cases of false document use reported by
the six Western Balkan countries at BCPs,
a number 2% higher than that of the previous quarter.

Refusals of entry

Serbia continued to rank first, with 29% of
all regional detections, followed by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and
Albania, each with 28% shares. As regards
nationalities, in Q4 2015 Albanians continued to rank first amongst false document

In the analysed period, the number of refusals of entry decreased by 31% compared
to the previous quarter: from roughly
14 000 to 9 600. This decrease appears
to be largely corresponding to the usual
contraction of tourist mobility in the final

quarter of the year. As compared to the
corresponding quarter of 2014, the number of issued refusals was similar. However,
despite the overall decrease compared to
Q3, the number of refusals issued to Turkish nationals continued to rise, being 8%
higher in Q4.
As usual, a large majority of refusals of
entry were issued at land borders (81%),
while the remaining 19% were largely reported at air borders.
Most of the refusals reported by the neighbouring EU Member States were issued
to nationals of Western Balkan countries
(96%). In turn, among those refused entry
by the six countries of the region 31% were
local residents, 30% were Turkish nationals and 20% were nationals of EU Member States/Schengen Associated Countries.
The overall number of refusals issued to
the non-regional nationalities associated
with the migratory flow originating from
Turkey/Greece continued to represent a
very low share of the total.

Situation in the Western Balkans

Illegal stay in Western Balkan countries
There were 786 detections of illegal stay,
reported by the six Western Balkan countries during the period under review, a
number 21% higher than that of the previous quarter, but very low considering
the overall size of the flow transiting the
region in the recent period. The number
was also significantly lower in relation to
the corresponding quarter of 2014 (-65%).
This development can be attributed to the
accelerated transit of the flow, which was
caused by migrants trying to cross the
Western Balkans as fast as possible before the various announced restrictions
or border closures are put into effect and/
or by the provision of transportation services by the authorities.

During the analysed quarter, Serbian and
Albanian nationals ranked first and second, respectively, among detected illegal
stayers. Citizens of Serbia were mainly
reported by Bosnia and Herzegovina and
Montenegro in almost equal shares, and
to a lesser extent by the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia, while the Albanians seem to have preferred staying in
the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Nationals of Bosnia and Herzegovina continued to rank third in detections
of illegal stayers during the fourth quarter and were mainly reported by Montenegro and Serbia.

Syrians, who used to be among the top
three nationalities of illegal stayers in previous quarters, practically disappeared
during the analysed period when only six
such nationals were reported.
As in the previous quarter, very few of
those who have transited Turkey/Greece
or Bulgaria before reaching the Western
Balkans region were detected while illegally staying in the six Western Balkan
countries.

II. Featured risk analyses

The number of detected illegal bordercrossings associated with the non-regional
transiting flow in the fourth quarter set a
new record, exceeding even the unprecedented situation in the third quarter.
More exactly, the quarterly total of over
1 330 000 detected illegal border-crossings
of non-regional migrants was more than
double the overall number of such detections registered during the third quarter
and over 63% higher than the total number reported since data collection began
(i.e. 818 000 illegal border-crossings between BCPs reported between January
2009 and September 2015).

As border prevention measures and the
policies of facilitated transit did not change
much compared to the previous period,
during Q4 2015 the non-regional migration flow continued to enter the Western Balkans across the southern common
borders with Greece and Bulgaria before
heading north and leaving the region especially across the Croatian-Serbian border section.

It was decided that starting from 19 November the passage would be restricted
for migrants who did not originate from
conflict areas (who are not Syrian, Iraqi or
Afghan). Although this decision was taken
in a coordinated manner by most of the
countries along the main route (Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia) the possibility of
verifying the nationality declared when
crossing the border remained severely limited. Most of the transited countries having
difficulties to obtain enough interpreters or screeners mainly rely on the documents/statements provided by migrants

The direct link between the non-regional
migration flow transiting the Western Balkans and the one affecting Greek borders,
especially in the Eastern Aegean Sea, was
also observed in the last three months of
2015. Specifically, the pressure from the
Aegean Islands continued to manifest itself on the Western Balkan route with an
even shorter lag, as the access to transportation shortened the time necessary for
migrants to organise their onwards movements (roughly 48 hours after arriving in
the Aegean they would head towards the
common border between Greece and the
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia)
(see Fig. 8).

wb-ran · q4 2015

When migrants got word of new restriction measures, many of them used different modi operandi trying to blend in with the
flow of nationals allowed transit.
As the authorities generally have competent document experts who can be used
to filter the flow, a large number of forged
Greek registration papers were detected
on migrants making false declaration of
their nationality (i.e. over 8 000 discovered by the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia between December 2015 and
January 2016). This better capacity to detect forgeries could also explain the observed rise in reported Iranians, especially
that they could easily alter their Greek registration papers (by changing one letter
only: from ‘Iran’ to ‘Iraq’) in order to pass
as Iraqis and be allowed transit.
On the other hand, nationality swapping
can consist in a simple act of making a false
statement or in the use of original documents obtained under false pretences (i.e.
false declaration of nationality at first arrival in Greece). This modus operandi does
not include the use of forged documents
and is generally more difficult to uncover.
Therefore, it could lead to many persons

managing to pass undetected among the
large number of migrants still allowed
transit (nationals of Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan). This may explain the sudden
drop in the flow of Pakistani migrants reported during the analysed period (-59%
compared to Q3), which stands in stark
contrast with the previously observed rising trend.
Another remarkable change was observed
in terms of detections of Moroccan nationals, who became the sixth most reported
migrants in the Western Balkans during
Q4 after registering a roughly fortyfold
rise compared with the previous threemonth period. As mentioned above, this
could be partly explained by the authorities’ better filtering the flow and revealing a larger share of nationality swapping.
On the other hand, this increase can also
have to do with an observed deflection
of the migration pressure from Morocco
away from the Spanish coast (as Moroccan
migrants are quickly readmitted based on
a well-functioning bi-lateral agreement)
towards the Central and especially the
Eastern Mediterranean routes, where the
liberal visa policy of Turkey and the per-

ceived easy transit through the Balkans
act as pull factors.
In the northern part of the region, the Croatian-Serbian border section became the
main exit point of the transiting flow, after
the Hungarian-Serbian green border was
sealed off in mid-September. Similarly to
the previous quarter, a decisive majority of
the flow (>99%) across the Croatian-Serbian border was registered as ‘unknown
nationality’, indicating that the high numbers of migrants severely overstretch the
screening and registration capacities of
the authorities.
At regional level, the share of illegal border-crossings associated with migrants of
‘unknown nationality’ remained similar to
the previous quarter, accounting for 40%
of the total non-regional flow. However,
an improvement of registration capacities
could be observed at the border between
Greece and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, where despite a massive
increase in the flow (68% higher than Q3)
only 15% of the detections were reported
as involving ‘unknown’ nationals, compared with 60% in Q3.
