Frontex official publications fall into four main categories: risk analysis, training,
operations and research, each marked with a distinct graphic identifier. Risk analysis
publications bear a triangular symbol formed by an arrow drawing a triangle, with a
dot at the centre. Metaphorically, the arrow represents the cyclical nature of risk
analysis processes and its orientation towards an appropriate operational response.
The triangle is a symbol of ideal proportions and knowledge, reflecting the pursuit
of factual exactness, truth and exhaustive analysis. The dot at the centre represents
the intelligence factor and the focal point where information from diverse sources
converges to be processed, systematised and shared as analytical products. Thus,
Frontex risk analysis is meant to be at the centre and to form a reliable basis for its
operational activities.

Introduction

FRAN Quarterly reports are prepared by
the Frontex Risk Analysis Unit and provide
a regular overview of irregular migration
at the EU external borders, based on the
irregular migration data exchanged among
Member State border-control authorities
within the cooperative framework of the
Frontex Risk Analysis Network (FRAN)
and its subsidiary, the European Union
Document-Fraud Risk Analysis Network
(EDF-RAN).
The main purpose of the FRAN Quarterlies is to provide:
1.	feedback to the FRAN community in
the context of information exchange;
2.	a periodic update to the situational picture of irregular migration at EU level;
and
3.	material for constructive discussion on
reporting protocols and related trends
and patterns.
This report is intended to simultaneously
serve two objectives: first – to provide a
clear summary of the situation at the external border of the EU, and second – to
serve as an archive for future reference
and comparative analyses.
Harmonising complex, multi-source migration data among Frontex and Member
States is an ongoing process. Therefore,

some of the more detailed data and trends
in this report should be interpreted with
caution and, where possible, cross-referenced with information from other
sources. The statistics should be understood in the context of the different levels of passenger flows passing through
different border sections, the activities
of Member State border-control authorities undertaken to secure different border sections and widespread variation in
reporting and data-collection practices.
FRAN members and Member State risk
analysis experts and border-control authorities are considered the primary customers of these reports. In addition to
the discussions taking place during FRAN
meetings, Member State experts are invited and actively encouraged to examine
and comment upon the data and analyses
presented here. Despite all efforts of the
Frontex Risk Analysis Unit and Member
State experts involved in data exchange
and analyses, it is conceivable that minor
errors will occur in these reports due to
very challenging timelines and the growing volume and complexity of the data and
other information exchanged within the
FRAN community.
Starting with the 2015 Q1 issue, the Frontex Risk Analysis Unit has implemented a

number of changes to present the analysis of migration related indicators in the
FRAN Quarterly in a more concise and focused way.
The first part provides a situational overview, broken down by main areas of work
of border-control authorities and police
activities related to irregular migration.
n	
Surveillance, describing and analysing
trends in detections of illegal bordercrossing between BCPs;
n	
Border checks, describing detections
reported during checks at BCPs (people hiding in vehicles or refused entry);
n	
Fraudulent documents, describing
trends and pattern related to document
fraud both at the border and within the EU;
n	
Situation in the EU, examining developments related to persons applying
for asylum and those detected staying illegally, facilitators, return decisions and effective returns.
The second thematic part of the report
consists of up to five featured risk analyses, examining trends and patterns of irregular migration in a more comprehensive
manner. Eventually it is hoped that some
of the featured analysis topics would be
developed by external contributors (FRAN
members, EU agencies and international
institutions).

Methodology

The current 29th issue of the FRAN Quarterly is a comparative analysis of FRAN
data collected between July and September 2015 and exchanged between 31 Member State border-control authorities within
the framework of the Frontex Risk Analysis Network (FRAN). The report presents
the results of statistical analysis of quarterly changes of eight irregular-migration
indicators and one asylum indicator, aggregated at the level of the event. Analytical reports exchanged by Member States
were also used for interpretative purposes
and to provide qualitative information, as
were other available sources of information, such as Frontex Joint Operations.
Precise definitions of Indicators 1 to 6,
aimed at harmonising the data exchanged
at EU level, were presented in the annexes
of the Q1 and Q2 reports in 2009 and so
are not repeated here.
The FRAN data exchange has been in
place since September 2008. Data are
exchanged through the ICONet Internet

4 of 35

platform, an interest group of the European Commission’s CIRCA server. Member State monthly data are based on a
country template prepared by the Frontex
Risk Analysis Unit. The deadline for submitting data for each month was the 25th
day of the subsequent month, with the
exception of the end-of-year data, which
are requested by 15 January each year. For
this 29th issue of the FRAN Quarterly, the
target for Member States to upload the
monthly data was thus 25 October 2015.
In principle, data submitted subsequent
to this date will be reflected in the next
FRAN Quarterly, except in cases where
clarification is needed in order to proceed
with comprehensive analysis.
In January 2012, the European Union
Document-Fraud Risk Analysis Network
(EDF-RAN) was formed as a specialist forum to oversee the exchange and analyses of detections of document fraud at
the external borders and on all international flights. The data were backdated and

merged with those exchanged under a pilot Tailored Risk Analysis released in 2011.
At the beginning of 2014, Member States
started to regularly collect quantitative
information on indicators related to secondary movements. In addition, in July
2014, Frontex organised a workshop for
Member State experts to gather their expertise and analyse available data. Their
input was essential for the analysis of intra-EU/Schengen secondary movements
of undocumented migrants.
External borders refer to the borders between Member States and third countries.
The borders between Schengen Associated
Countries (Liechtenstein, Norway, Iceland
and Switzerland) and third countries are
also considered as external borders. The
borders between Schengen Associated
Countries and Schengen Member States
are considered as internal borders. For the
indicators on detections of facilitators, illegal stay and asylum, statistics are also reported for detections at the land borders

fran · q3 2015

between Schengen Member States and
Schengen candidates (Bulgaria, Croatia,
Cyprus and Romania) or non-Schengen
Member States (the UK and Ireland), so
that a total for Member States and Schengen Associated Countries as a whole can
be presented. It was not possible to make
this distinction for air and sea borders because Member States do not habitually
differentiate between extra-EU and intra-EU air and sea connections but tend
to aggregate data for all arrivals.

When data are examined at the level of
third-country nationalities, a large percentage usually falls under categories of
‘Other (not specified)’ or ‘Unknown’. It is
expected that the percentage reported
under these categories will decrease
with time as Member States improve
the quality and speed of their identification, data collection and reporting practices: nationalities are often reported
as ‘Unknown’ if an individual’s nationality cannot be established before reports
are submitted.

Acknowledgements
The Frontex Risk Analysis Unit would like
to express its gratitude to all FRAN and
EDF-RAN members and their associates
in Member State statistical, migration and
document-fraud units who collect, aggregate and exchange monthly data, also to
the analysts who compile the analytical reports on which much of the detailed analyses presented here are based.

Between the second and third quarter of
2015, the FRAN indicators of illegal bordercrossings between BCPs, illegal stay, and
asylum increased exponentially, reaching
their highest ever recorded levels since
data collection for the respective indicators began. On the other hand, Member
States reported fewer detections of illegal border-crossing at BCPs and effective
returns to third countries than in Q2 2015.
Compared to one year ago, the relative importance of particular migration routes has
clearly shifted. In Q3 2015, most migrants
were detected on the Eastern Mediterranean and Western Balkan routes. Indeed,
most migrants who had entered the EU
from Turkey were reported for a second
time when they passed through the Western Balkans and then crossed the external
EU border from Serbia to Croatia.
Illegal border-crossings detected at the EU
external borders with Turkey have substantially increased reaching the highest level in
FRAN data collection history. The increase
was mostly reported from the Eastern Aegean Sea, where Lesbos, Chios and Samos
were among the most targeted islands. One
year ago, the month of October had already
indicated the upcoming winter low in the
Eastern Aegean Sea. This year, however,
the rise in the number of detections on this
route continued unabated.
Also irregular migration on the Western
Balkan route has reached its highest level
since Frontex started its data collection.

Migratory flows in the Central Mediterranean have not reached the levels of one
year ago, with the number of detections
around 18% lower than in Q3 2014. With the
end of the summer, migratory flows across
the Central Mediterranean Sea decreased
even further. The number of Syrians, for example, represented only around 4% of the
level reported back in September 2014. On
the other hand, the detections of Nigerian,
Somali, Sudanese, Eritrean, Moroccan and
Cameroonian migrants were substantially
higher than one year ago.
Member States detected fewer facilitators than in the previous quarter. Most
conspicuous in this regard is a decrease in
arrests of EU nationals from France, Italy
and Spain. On the other hand, more nationals of countries along the Western Balkan route were arrested, including Turkish,
Greek, Bulgarian and Hungarian citizens.
In spite of the unprecedented level of irregular migration, the numbers of return decisions and effective returns decreased by 3%
and 1% since last quarter, respectively. Most
significant are the decreases of effectively
returned Kosovo* citizens, while the number of returned Iraqis was 29% higher than
in the previous quarter.

FRAN data for the period between July
and September 2015 show an over 449%
increase in overall detections of illegal border-crossing compared to the same period
of 2014. With 617 412 detections in Q3 2015,
Member States reported the highest number of illegal border-crossings since FRAN
data collection began in 2007, clearly exceeding the previous record of more than
170 000 irregular migrants reported in
Q2 2015.

100 000 in September to around 110 000 in
October. The total number of Afghans also
increased significantly (three times since
Q2 2015), but their share amongst all nationalities shrank from about a quarter of
all detections in Q2 2015 to 17% during the
reporting period.

Another strong increase in
irregular migration on the Eastern
Mediterranean route

Many irregular migrants who had arrived
in Greece or Bulgaria decided to continue
their journey across Western Balkan countries towards Western and Northern Europe. The numbers of persons detected
illegally crossing the EU’s external border from Serbia increased 25-fold compared with the same period of 2014 and
by 566% compared to the previous quarter, reaching the highest level since FRAN
data collection began in 2007. Until August, almost all apprehensions were reported by Hungary.

Q3 2015 saw the highest ever recorded
growth in detections of illegal border-crossing from the previous quarter. Most illegal
border-crossings (almost 320 000) were reported on the Eastern Mediterranean route.
Of this number, almost all accounted for
detections on the Eastern Aegean islands,
where the number was 15 times higher than
during the same period of 2014 and almost
four times higher than in Q2 2015. Around
70% of the irregular migrants claimed to be
of Syrian nationality, compared to 58% during the previous quarter. Subsequent to the
reporting period, the total number of Syrians
on this route increased once again, from over

Influx of migrants from Turkey leads
to intensified secondary movements
across the Western Balkans

In mid-September 2015 Hungary completed the construction of a fence at its
border with Serbia which was initiated in
reaction to the intense migration pressure
on the Western Balkan route. The meas-

ure effectively diverted the transiting migratory flow from the country’s border
with Serbia to Croatia, only to increase
the pressure on the Croatian-Hungarian
border. Thus, Hungary extended the fence
to this border section as well, which on its
completion on 16 October stopped the migration flow through Hungary. From this
day on, the vast majority of migrants has
transited Slovenia and Austria to reach
their destinations in Western and Northern Europe.
In contrast to last winter, the share of migrants from Kosovo* and other Western
Balkan countries has shrunk to below 1% of
irregular migration flow on this route. Already in June, the increase in non-regional
migrants had by far exceeded the peak of
Kosovo* citizens observed during February 2015. By the third quarter of 2015, irregular flows of Syrian, Afghan, Pakistani,
Iraqi, Bangladeshi, Iranian and other nationals had reached new highs, making the
Western Balkans the single most important entry route for migrants headed for
the EU. Notably, compared with the previous quarter, also the number of African
migrants detected on this route increased
by 150%, with Somalis and Cameroonians
ranking top among African nationalities.

Detections in the Central
Mediterranean below the
unprecedented levels of Q3 2014
Migratory flows across the Central Mediterranean Sea gained momentum during the summer months, but did not equal
the unprecedented levels of one year before. Compared to the previous quarter,
the number of illegal border-crossings reported by Italy and Malta only increased
by 3%. In previous years, the growth in
detections between the second and the
third quarters used to be much more significant. The weaker growth in between
Q2 and Q3 2015 was caused by fewer Syrian nationals crossing the Central Mediterranean Sea. Syrians increasingly avoided
the risky Central Mediterranean route and
opted for the Eastern Aegean Sea as an
entry point into the EU. In Q3 2015, the
number of Syrians detected on their way
to Italy and Malta decreased by 13% compared to the previous quarter and by 87%
compared to the Q3 2014.
Some nationalities, however, were reported
in significantly higher numbers than in previous reporting periods. In Q3 2015, the

number of detected West Africans rose by
28% in relation to the second quarter and
by 72% compared with the corresponding
period of 2014. For example, detections of
Nigerians rose from 3 644 in Q3 2014 to
9 395 during the reporting period. Also the
number of Ghanaians more than doubled
in year-on-year terms, reaching 2 100 detections between July and September. The
strongest percentage increases compared
to Q3 2014 (though relatively low in absolute numbers) were reported for nationals
of Guinea-Bissau, Benin, Liberia and Togo.
In the past, a rise in detections of certain
nationalities in late summer was often followed by even greater growth in the following year.
Steady increase in detections of
irregular migration from Morocco to
Spain
Although irregular migration on the Western Mediterranean route remains relatively
low, Spain has reported increases in detections of irregular migrants for the fourth
consecutive summer. In Q3 2015, more
than 3 500 migrants tried to reach the EU
from the Moroccan territory, 3% less than

in the last quarter but 30% more than in
the same period of last year. The continuously increasing migration pressure is
mainly caused by Syrian migrants trying
to reach the Spanish towns of Ceuta and
Melilla. In Q3 2015, Spain reported more
than 1 500 Syrians from its land border
with Morocco, compared to just around
50 one year before.
By contrast, at the sea border between
Spain and Morocco there were only half
as many detections as in the same period
last year, with the only significant increase
observed for Algerian nationals.
Increased detections at the EU’s
eastern border
In Q3 2015, detections of illegal border-crossing at the eastern borders were
at the highest level since 2008, exceeding
even the migratory flows during the climax
of the armed conflict in the Ukraine one
year ago. The growth in irregular migration
resulted from significantly more Afghans
attempting to illegally enter Hungary and
Vietnamese trying to enter Latvia.

In Q3 2015, 32 868 refusals of entry were
issued at the EU external borders, which is
both higher than during the previous quarter and in the same period last year. Again,
a substantial increase (+48%) in relation to
Q2 2014 was observed for refusals issued to
Ukrainian nationals, most of whom were
refused at the Polish border. The number
of refused Ukrainians also increased at
the Hungarian external borders. In most
cases Ukrainians were not let into the EU
because they could not present appropriate documentation justifying the purpose
and conditions of stay. Refusals were also
issued to a higher number of other nationals from Eastern Europe, including Russian
and Belarusian citizens, especially by Poland and Lithuania. The stated reason for

The number of refusals issued to Albanians rose by more than 5% compared to the
last quarter, especially at the Croatian and
Hungarian borders. Notably, the majority
of Albanian nationals was refused because
of an alert existing in the SIS or a national
register. The increasing issuance of refusals to Albanian nationals is clearly in line
with a general upward trend of Albanian
migration, which is also reflected in an increasing number of asylum applications
and detections of illegal stay.

Fewer migrants entering the EU
hidden in lorries, buses and trains
In Q3 2015, the total number of detections
of migrants trying to enter the EU clan-

destinely through BCPs was about a third
lower than one year before and around
15% lower than in the previous quarter.
678 persons attempted to cross the EU’s
external borders hiding in lorries or trains
between July and October. Again, most
clandestine entry attempts were reported
in South-East Europe, mainly attempting
to enter the EU from Turkey.
Thus, most detections of clandestine entry were once again made by Bulgaria,
through which a large share of the migratory flow transiting Turkey is channelled.
The Bulgarian BCPs most affected by clandestine entries were Kapitan Andreevo and
Lesovo, and 93% of all detections were related to Syrian, Afghan and Iraqi nationals. Illegal border-crossing through BCPs
was an option used by migrants who had
previously attempted to cross the green

unsuccessfully or had been deterred by
these countries’ intensified police operations and surveillance of their external
EU borders.
The number of detected clandestine entrants is likely to stay at the current high
level or even to rise in the future, as Bulgaria is implementing its plan to significantly extend the length of the existing
technical obstacle along its border with
Turkey by another 130 km in addition to
the already existing 30 km.

Again, most illegal stayers on exit
detected at German airports
During the reporting period, more than
17 000 persons were detected on exit
from the EU or Schengen area without a
permission to stay. The current level rep-

resents an increase of around 9% compared to last quarter. The FRAN data
collection does not cover the reason for
illegal stay, so the cases of illegal stay
detected on exit include migrants who
had either crossed the border to the EU/
Schengen Associated Countries illegally,
abused legal channels, or initially entered
the EU/Schengen Associated Countries legally but no longer fulfilled the conditions
of stay or residence.
In Q3 2015, most detections of illegal stay
were related to persons leaving the EU
through German airports (more than
4 000). The increase was to a very large
extent caused by citizens from Turkey, Kosovo*, and China who attempted to leave
through German airports without a residence permit or a valid visa. With more
than 2 000 reported illegal stayers on exit
in Q3 2015, numbers have been also in-

creasing in France. This increasing trend
was mostly due to more Algerians and
Tunisians willing to leave on flights from
France without a valid permission to stay.
All over the EU and Schengen Area, a record of 3 000 detections of illegal stay
on exit were related to Ukrainian nationals, thus representing the highest ranking nationality reported by the Member
States. More than three thirds of these
Ukrainians were reported from the external land BCPs in Poland and Hungary.
The comparably low number of illegal border-crossings of Ukrainians indicates that
most Ukrainian irregular migrants had entered the EU legally and then overstayed,
or had entered the EU through the abuse
of legal means, such as fraudulently obtained work or business visas.

Further increase of document fraud
detections on intra-EU/Schengen
movements
In Q3 2015, the overall number of document fraud incidents reported in the
EDF-RAN was 15% higher than last quarter, reaching 6 364 cases, involving 7 147
detected fraudulent documents. At the
same time, Q3 2015 marked the highest
numbers since the EDF data collection
has started. This was mainly due to an
ongoing increase in detections on intraEU/Schengen movements but more document fraud cases were reported also on
other travel directions.
Reported increases on intra-EU/Schengen
movements have mostly resulted from the
increasing detections between Schengen

area and the UK and Ireland. The number of persons aiming to go to the UK with
fraudulent document more than doubled
compared to Q3 2014 and reached a record
figure of document fraud cases in Q3 2015.
This trend is mostly attributable to the sustained high number of Albanian nationals
followed by Ukrainian. Other nationalities
aiming to reach the UK with fraudulent document were Syrian and Chinese.
The current migration crisis is obviously
influencing also document fraud detections on the air routes between Greece and
Germany, translating into the highest figures ever, even if the difference compared
to the previous quarters of 2015 is limited.
Most of these detections were attributable to the Syrian nationals that decided for
a faster route to their desired destination.

The very low number of Syrian nationals
detected with fraudulent documents on
the way from Greece to Germany, however, does not compare with the huge intra-Schengen migratory flows in Q3 2015.
Taking into consideration movements inside the EU/Schengen area the real number of Syrians detected with fraudulent
document can be far higher.
In fact, most of the document fraud detections on intra-EU/Schengen movements
were detected on flights from southern
Europe.

The number of detections of document

compared to Q1 and slightly higher compared to Q2 2015, slightly exceeding 2 200
detections. At EU level, of the 97 nationalities detected using fraudulent documents
to illegally enter the EU or Schengen area
from a third country, the most commonly
detected were Ukrainians (420), Moroccans (306) and Syrians (179).
As in the previous months, most detections were reported from air routes. The
number of document fraud cases from

Istanbul Atatürk decreased by 20% compared to the previous quarter. Another significant drop down was recorded on the
air route between Lagos and the EU. The
number of document fraud detections on
arrivals from Lagos has been decreasing
since March 2015. Hence most document
fraud detections involving departure places
in Africa were recorded on the routes leading from Senegal, Dakar and Mali, Bamako towards the EU.
Syrian nationals remained the most prevalent nationality using fraudulent documents at the air borders, many arriving
from Turkish airports, although the number of related detections on flights from
third countries was only half as high as
during the same period of 2014.

and Spain, however, the situation has
changed in regards to the nationalities
of the detected illegal migrants. Whilst
at the beginning of 2015 there was still
a relatively high share of Syrian nationals, nowadays the prevailing nationality
is represented by Moroccans.
The most frequently used land border section remains the Polish-Ukrainian border
due to the Ukrainian nationals.

In Q3 2015, detections of illegal stay were
71% higher than during the last quarter
and amounted to more than 280 000 persons reported in the EU/Schengen Area.
This is the highest number of detections
of illegal stay since FRAN data collection
began in 2007. Most persons detected for
illegal stay were from Syria, Afghanistan
and Iraq. The detections were mostly related to the large numbers of migrants
who arrived in the EU first from Turkey,
transited the Western Balkans, and continued their journey on secondary routes
through the Schengen area towards their
desired destination. Hence in Q3 2015, Germany, Sweden, France, and Austria were
the top countries for detections of illegal
stay, reporting more than 70% of the total EU/SAC number.

tections. Most of these detections were
made in Germany, leading to a number almost six times as high as one year ago. Also
in Sweden, detections of Syrians increased
strongly, to almost 17 000 migrants in the
reporting period. Off the main intra-Schengen route, in the Czech Republic, the number of illegally staying Syrians increased five
times compared with Q2 2015, though on
a lower level.

Also the numbers of undocumented migrants of nationalities, which were previously reported to a lesser extent, increased
significantly: Compared to Q2 2015, detections of illegal stayers from Bangladesh almost doubled, while those from
Iran increased by 75% and those from Iraq
by even 278%.

In Q3 2015, Member States reported more
than 405 131 asylum applications, which
is the highest number of any previous
quarter since FRAN data collection began in 2007 and almost 150 % more than
during the same period of 2014. Almost

two-thirds submitted their application in
the top-three countries Germany, Hungary and Sweden. Most asylum seekers
in Hungary absconded to apply for asylum in another country. In Q3 2015, Finland was the country where the asylum
indicator grew fastest (to over 15 000, i.e.
more than 13-fold compared to Q3 2014).
On the other hand, asylum figures from
Denmark were almost one quarter lower
than one year ago.
Syrians were again the top-ranking asylum nationality in the EU/Schengen Area
with more than 137 000 applications in the
reporting period, which is three times as
many as in Q3 2014. Also Afghan, Iraqi, and
Albanian nationals submitted the highest
number of asylum applications (56 914,
41 972 and 26 017, respectively) since FRAN
data collection began, reflecting the large
migration flows of these nationalities along
the Eastern Mediterranean and Western
Balkan routes. An emerging asylum seeker
nationality are migrants from Bangladesh.
While just more than 2 000 applied for
asylum in the last quarter, their number
rose to 7 126 in the reporting period. Most

reached the record 26 017 reported asylum applications. Also the asylum applications of nationals of the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia and from Montenegro, 90% of which were submitted in
Germany, reached unprecedented levels.
Numbers of return decisions and
effective returns higher
In Q2 2015, Member State authorities issued 73 363 decisions to third country nationals with an obligation to leave the
EU following an administrative or judicial decision. Thus the number of return
decisions has decreased by 3% compared
to last quarter, although Member States
have been reporting increasing asylum
applications by migrants from countries
with low asylum recognition rates. Among
other reasons, the increase was caused by

fewer return decisions issued to nationals of Northern African countries, including Morocco and Algeria. But also a lower
number of Kosovo* citizens and Palestinians received a decision to return. It should
be noted in the context of Syrian nationals that these decisions did not imply any
potential return to the conflict region.
Also the number of effective returns has
decreased since last quarter, although to
a lesser extent. During the reporting period, almost 43 965 effective returns took
place, which is 1% less than in Q2 2015, and
11% more than in Q3 2014. The nationality
and trend patterns are similar to those of
the return decisions:

Additional measures
at intra-EU borders

n Temporary internal border
controls between several EU
Member States
n Internal Schengen controls
to support the management
of intra-EU migratory flows

In the wake of an increasing number of migrants arriving in the EU and the chaotic
scenes at the external borders in September 2015, when migrants forced their way
through the border and on board trains and
buses, several Schengen Member States reintroduced temporary border controls at
their borders with other Schengen Member States. Additional internal border controls were reintroduced after the terrorist
attack in Paris in November 2015.

for asylum in Germany. The controls enable
the registration and dispatching of these
persons to Germany. In addition, persons
travelling on the highways, primary road
connections and international trains may
also be controlled. Although some restrictions were imposed on cross-border rail
connections with Austria, there has been
no limitation of border crossing possibilities, with the introduction of designated
specific crossing points.

On 13 September 2015, Germany has reintroduced border controls at the German
internal borders, with a special focus on
the land border with Austria. In a notification to the European Commission, Germany claimed that the spontaneous and
uncontrolled inflow constituted a serious
threat to the internal security and public
policy and the temporary reintroduction
of border controls was intended to provide
appropriate assistance to the arriving persons including more structured procedures.

In September, also Austria has reintroduced controls at its border with Italy,
Hungary and Slovakia, but has mostly
concentrated efforts at the border with
Slovenia, from where the largest flow of
persons without legal travel documents
are arriving.

The controls by Germany cover a limited
number of main roads agreed between
Austria and Germany for the handing-over
of persons declaring their intention to apply

In mid-October, Hungary has reintroduced controls at its short border with
Slovenia for a period of ten days. The step
was taken after Hungary had extended
its border fence with Serbia also to Croatia, which has effectively stopped migration through Hungary and diverted the
transit of migrants to Slovenia and further to Austria.

Previously, the Slovenian authorities had
also reintroduced controls on their side of
the border with Hungary. Their purpose
was to secure this border when the main
migratory flow still transited through Hungary. These controls have ended by the
end of October.

In November, Sweden has reintroduced
controls on its ferry connections from the
south and on the bridge to Denmark. Similarly, Norway has reinstated temporary
border controls in November with a focus on ports with ferry connections with
Schengen countries. Denmark and the

fran · q3 2015

Czech Republic have not officially reintroduced their border controls, but have
intensified police presence and checks of
travellers.

Figure 1. Temporarily reinstated border internal border controls within the EU and
main secondary migration flows between August and November 2015

In the aftermath of the terrorist attack
in Paris in November, and also coinciding
with the measures planned in view of the
large COP21 conference held in Paris in December, France reinstated controls at its
borders with Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland, Italy and Spain. Belgium has stepped up police controls on
the main roads from France.
While controls have been reintroduced at
many internal border sections, their intensity and frequency is not comparable
to the controls at the external borders. In
most cases, the reintroduction of internal
controls means the presence of police patrols with the authority to perform border
checks. In Germany, the reintroduction of
the controls is focused on suspicious private vehicles and public transport, mostly
trains and buses. Another objective is to
ensure a smooth handover of persons who
intend to apply for asylum in Germany and
are escorted by the Austrian police up to
the border.

So far the main impact of the reintroduction of some form of controls at internal borders has been the restraining of
the chaos at the internal borders. However, the measures have not reduced the
number of migrants, neither at the external nor internal borders: The numbers
of reported migrants in Greece in October were still higher than in September.
Similarly, Germany has reported more
weekly migrant arrivals after their introduction of border controls than before. Moreover, in some Member States
organised transport from one internal
border to the next is available to migrants. For migrants arriving in Greece,
this has rather speeded up travel to their
final destination, mostly Germany.

Increased propensity of Iraqis
to leave their country
According to open-source information, living standards in Iraqi Kurdistan have rapidly
deteriorated as the regional conflict continues and politicians haggle over power. Basic
services and essentials, including electricity,
cooking gas and water, are not guaranteed
and corruption permeates the quasi-institutions of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and society at large.
Furthermore, the security situation in Iraq
also plays an important role in the people’s
decision to migrate. According to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre
(IDMC), there were at least 4 million internally displaced persons in Iraq as of 15
June 2015, which can also be regarded as
a push factor.
Apparently, the growing proportion of
population of Iraqi Kurdistan is frustrated
by the recent developments and likely to
leave the country. There are no precise
figures but the United Nations estimates
that more than 50 000 people left Iraq
over the summer of 2015.
Moreover, during September and October Iraqi authorities were also confronted
with an unusually high demand for new
passports (roughly 13 000 applications per
day), while flights from Baghdad to Turkey were booked for months in advance.
These developments tend to point towards
an increased propensity of Iraqis to leave
their country.

Main modus operandi and routes
Information obtained during debriefing
activities indicates that Iraqi migrants

Figure 3: Iraqi migrants taking photos

manage to obtain Turkish visas without
difficulty and then travel legally to Turkey, even flying from Baghdad to Istanbul.
Older information also indicates that Iraqi
migrants who choose to illegally cross into
Turkey employ locals familiar with the terrain to guide them across the land border
in the area of Zakho/Silopi.
Moreover, despite the fact that Iraqis need
a visa to enter Turkey, in 2014 there were
almost twice as many regular passengers
reported at Şırnak-Habur, the main BCP
of Turkey with Iraq (3.74 million), as those
at the main BCP with Greece (1.98 million). Furthermore, in terms of the entry/
exit ratio of Iraqis, which could be indicative of the risk of overstaying or transit,
there were 61 000 more entries to Turkey
during 2014. Considering this, the visa obligation is not a major obstacle for Iraqis
to enter Turkey when they need to. Likewise, the entry/exit ratio suggests that
Turkey is treated as a transit country on
route to Greece.

Public transport is used to travel across
Turkey, with Istanbul and Izmir being the
main hubs where deals with facilitators
for the onwards journey to Europe are
made. Generally, the cost of crossing the
Aegean Sea to the Greek islands is around
EUR 1 500, while the facilitators who guide
people across Turkey’s land borders to Bulgaria charge around EUR 1 000.

Iraqi migration: the impact of
the Syrian crisis, geography
and perceptions
Between January and September 2015,
roughly 275 000 Syrians (227 000 in Q3)
and about 22 500 Iraqis (17 700 in Q3) were
reported in the Eastern Mediterranean.
As a knock-on effect, roughly 185 000 illegal border-crossings between BCPs by
Syrians (159 000 in Q3) and 17 000 by Iraqis (12 000 in Q3) were registered on the
Western Balkan route.

populations (mainly Arabic and Kurdish)
is also very similar. Therefore, it is hardly
surprising that the Iraqi and Syrian migrants use similar routes and modi operandi.
The two nationalities tend to transit Turkey, reach the external borders of Greece
and then move via the Western Balkans
to reach their final destinations in other
EU Member States/Schengen Associated
Countries.
Perceptions generally play an important
role in migration decisions. One of such
perceptions is that Syrian nationals are
offered better prospects of moving and
receiving international protection in the
EU. For example, since 2014 Syrian nationals have not been kept in closed reception
centres after being apprehended in Greece,
and they are currently allowed to leave the
Eastern Aegean Islands aboard ferries in
order to go and register their asylum request in Athens.

Given the geographical proximity of these
two countries of origin to the Eastern
part of the EU and the Western Balkans,
it is somewhat natural that the highest
number of detected Syrian and Iraqi migrants are reported on the two mentioned
routes.

Due to these perceived advantages, other
nationals may falsely claim to be Syrian
(the so-called nationality swapping) and
sometimes even obtain fraudulent Syrian
documents (a phenomenon revealed during debriefing interviews conducted in the
Eastern Aegean and also further along the
route, in Hungary).

Syria and Iraq are neighbouring countries,
both also share a border with Turkey. The
ethnic and linguistic composition of their

This perception, along with the geographical proximity, the ethnic, cultural and linguistic similarities of Iraq and Syria, may

have encouraged many Iraqis to falsely
claim Syrian nationality and enter the EU,
often successfully. Thus the real number
of Iraqis who have already reached the
EU could in fact be higher than the official statistics show.
The trend of Iraqis detected for illegal border-crossing on the Eastern Mediterranean
route has been sharply rising throughout
2015 with the third quarter showing the
highest value since data collection began
(Fig. 2). This may confirm open-source reports of high numbers of people leaving
Iraq heading for Europe.

Iraqi security forces leaving for Europe
Some Iraqi soldiers are abandoning their posts and joining a wave of civilian migrants headed for Europe, raising new doubts about the cohesion of
the country’s Western-backed security forces in the fight against ISIL/Da’ish
militants. Interviews with migrants and an analysis of social media activity suggest that scores of servicemen of the national army, police and special forces, as well as Shiite militias and Kurdish peshmerga, have defected
in recent months or plan to leave soon.

Sources and Methods
For the data concerning detections at
the external borders, some of the border types are not applicable to all FRAN
Member States. This pertains to data
on all FRAN indicators since the data
are provided disaggregated by border
type. The definitions of detections at
land borders are therefore not applicable (excluding borders with non-Schengen principalities) for Belgium, the Czech
Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta,
the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK. For Cyprus, the land
border refers to the Green Line demarcation with the area not under the effective
control of the government of the Republic
of Cyprus. For sea borders, the definitions
are not applicable for land-locked Member States including Austria, the Czech
Republic, Hungary, Luxembourg, Slovakia and Switzerland.
In addition, data on detections of illegal
border-crossing at land, air and sea BCPs
(1B) are not available for Iceland, Ireland
and Spain and in Greece (these detections
are included in the data for Indicator 1A).
Data for Norway only includes detections
of illegal border-crossing at land and sea
BCPs (1B), not between BCPs (1A).

Data on detections of illegal border-crossing between sea BCPs (1A) are not available for Ireland.
Data on apprehension (FRAN Indicator 2)
of facilitators is not available for Ireland.
For Italy, the data are not disaggregated
by border type, but are reported as total
apprehensions (not specified). Data for Italy and Norway also include the facilitation of illegal stay and work. For Romania,
the data include land intra-EU detections
on exit at the border with Hungary.
For the data concerning detections of illegal stay (FRAN Indicator 3), data on detections at exit are not available for Denmark,
Ireland, Italy, Spain and the UK.
Data on refusals of entry (FRAN Indicator 4) at the external EU borders are not
disaggregated by reason of refusal for Ireland and the UK. Refusals of entry at the
Spanish land borders at Ceuta and Melilla
(without the issuance of a refusal form) are
reported separately and are not included
in the presented FRAN data.

of border on entry or inland applications)
for Austria, the Czech Republic and Slovenia. For these countries, only the total
number of applications is reported. For
France, only asylum applications at the
external borders are reported, not inland
applications. For the UK, data reported for
applications at air BCPs also include applications at sea BCPs.
The data on return decisions issued (FRAN
Indicator 7A) are not available for Ireland,
France, the Netherlands and Sweden. The
data on effective returns (FRAN Indicator 7B) are not available for Ireland. In addition, the data of effective returns are not
disaggregated by return operation (voluntary and forced) for Spain. The data on
voluntary effective returns (FRAN Indicator 7A) are not disaggregated by type of
return operation (IOM-assisted and others) for Belgium, Czech Republic, Finland
and the Netherlands. The data on forced
effective returns (FRAN Indicator 7A) are
not disaggregated by type of return operation (enforced by Member Stated and
by Joint Operations) for Belgium, Finland,
Iceland and the Netherlands.

The data on applications for international
protection (FRAN Indicator 5) are not disaggregated by place of application (type
