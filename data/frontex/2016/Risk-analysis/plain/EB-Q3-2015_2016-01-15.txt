Frontex official publications fall into four main categories: risk analysis, training,
operations and research, each marked with a distinct graphic identifier. Risk analysis
publications bear a triangular symbol formed by an arrow drawing a triangle, with a
dot at the centre. Metaphorically, the arrow represents the cyclical nature of risk
analysis processes and its orientation towards an appropriate operational response.
The triangle is a symbol of ideal proportions and knowledge, reflecting the pursuit of
factual exactness, truth and exhaustive analysis. The dot at the centre represents the
intelligence factor and the focal point where information from diverse sources converges
to be processed, systematised and shared as analytical products. Thus, Frontex risk
analysis is meant to be at the centre and to form a reliable basis for its operational
activities.

Introduction

Concept
The Eastern European Borders Risk Analysis Network (EB-RAN) performs monthly
exchanges of statistical data and information on the most recent irregular migration trends. This information is compiled
at the level of the Frontex Risk Analysis
Unit (RAU) and analysed in cooperation
with the regional partners on a quarterly
and annual basis. The annual reports offer a more in-depth analysis of the occurring developments and phenomena which
impact the regional and common borders, while the quarterly reports are meant
to provide regular updates and identify
emerging trends in order to maintain situational awareness. Both types of reports

are aimed at offering support for strategic
and operational decision making.

Methodology
The Eastern European Borders Quarterly
statistical overview is focused on quarterly
developments for the seven key indicators
of irregular migration: (1) detections of illegal border-crossing between BCPs, (2) detections of illegal border-crossing at BCPs,
(3) refusals of entry, (4) detections of illegal stay, (5) asylum applications, (6) detections of facilitators, and (7) detections
of fraudulent documents.1

of the EB-RAN (Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova) and reference period statistics from
common border sections of the neighbouring EU Member States (Norway, Finland,
Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania). The data are
processed, checked for errors and merged
into an Excel database for further analysis.

Structure
The report consists of a general situational
overview broken down by main areas of
work of border-control authorities and police activities related to irregular migration
and the statistical annex.

The backbone of this overview are monthly
statistics provided within the framework

1

Please note that the analysis of this indicator
is now limited to EB-RAN countries
only, given that EU Member States have
transitioned to the European Union
Document-Fraud (EDF) reporting scheme.

Border surveillance

Illegal border-crossing
During the third quarter of 2015, 1 866
cases of illegal crossing of the regional and
common borders between BCPs were reported. This constitutes an increase of 32%
in relation to the second quarter of 2015
and 87% compared to the same quarter of 2014.

Figure 3. Detections between BCPs at the common borders and EU Member States’
land borders with the Russian Federation (data only from the EU side) show that the
pressure in Q3 2015 as compared with the same period last year was the highest at
the Hungarian-Ukrainian and Latvian-Russian border sections

Nationals of CIS and EaP countries (mostly
Ukrainians, Russians and Moldovans) accounted for almost half (49%) of the total
detections. Although Ukrainian citizens
were among the most numerous nationals detected for the illegal border-crossing between BCPs in Q3 2015, only 22 such
cases were related to irregular migration,
the rest being reported under smuggling
(21%) or as other reasons (75%).

Facilitators
The number of detected facilitators increased by 75% in the third quarter of 2015
in relation to the second quarter (from 32
in Q2 2015 to 56 in Q3 2015) and by 14% in
comparison to the same period in 2014
(from 49 in Q3 2014).
66% of all facilitators detected in the analysed period were mostly citizens of the
countries of the region, with Russians
ranking top, followed by Ukrainians, Latvians, Romanians and Kazakhs.

Figure 4. In Q3 2015, Russian facilitators ranked top in the number of detections,
followed by Ukrainians, Latvians, Romanians and Kazakhs. The number of Hungarian
facilitators was much lower than in Q3 2014, and no Belarusians were reported

Border checks
Clandestine entries
In the third quarter of 2015, no cases of
clandestine entry were reported at the
Eastern European borders.

Refusals of entry
The number of refusals of entry reported
during Q3 2015 at the common and regional
borders decreased by 1.7% when compared
with Q2 2015 and increased by 4.7% in relation to the third quarter of 2014. The vast
majority of refusals (92%) was reported at
land borders, while the remaining 8% at
air and sea borders. The highest number

8 of 15

of refusals was issued by Poland, Ukraine
and Belarus.
The top five refused nationalities were
those of Ukraine, the Russian Federation,
Moldova, Belarus and Azerbaijan.
Poland mostly refused entry to Ukrainians,
Russians, Belarusians, Tajiks and Georgians.
Ukraine, in turn, issued most refusals of
entry to Russians, Azeri, Moldovans, Uzbeks and Tajiks, with a significant drop
observed for Russians, Uzbeks and Tajiks.

Document fraud
In the third quarter of 2015, detections of
persons using fraudulent documents reported by the three EB-RAN countries
(Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine) decreased
by 18% when compared with the second
quarter of 2015. Over 70% of detections
were reported by Ukraine, while the most
significant drop was observed in Moldova.
Moldovans were still the most frequently
detected fraudulent document users, followed by Ukrainians. Similarly to Q2 2015,
the most commonly used fraudulent documents were Moldovan passports.

Situation in the Eastern European region

Illegal stay in EB-RAN countries
In the third quarter of 2015 there were
7 687 detections of illegal stay reported by
the three EB-RAN countries, which represents an increase of 19% when compared
with the second quarter of 2015 and by
29% in relation to Q3 2014.

The top five nationalities detected for illegal stay in the EB-RAN countries were
Russians, Ukrainians, Moldovans, Georgians and Azeris. Citizens of the Russian
Federation and Azerbaijan were mostly
detected by Ukraine, while Ukrainians,
Georgians and Moldovans – by Belarus.

Almost 98% of detections of illegal stay
was reported on exit, out of which 49%
were recorded by Ukraine and 44% by Belarus. Most illegal stayers were reported
at the Ukrainian land borders with Belarus and the Russian Federation, followed
by Belarusian and Ukrainian air borders.
