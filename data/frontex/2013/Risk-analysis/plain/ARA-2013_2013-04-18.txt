Frontex official publications fall into four main categories: risk analysis, training, operations and
research, each marked with a distinct graphic identifier. Risk analysis publications bear a triangular symbol formed by an arrow drawing a triangle, with a dot at the centre. Metaphorically,
the arrow represents the cyclical nature of risk analysis processes and its orientation towards an
appropriate operational response. The triangle is a symbol of ideal proportions and knowledge,
reflecting the pursuit of factual exactness, truth and exhaustive analysis. The dot at the centre
represents the intelligence factor and the focal point where information from diverse sources
converges to be processed, systematised and shared as analytical products. Thus, Frontex risk
analysis is meant to be at the centre and to form a reliable basis for its operational activities.

Executive summary
Detections of illegal border-crossing along
the EU’s external borders dropped sharply
in 2012 to about 73 000, i.e. half the number reported in 2011. This was the first time
since systematic data collection began in
2008 that annual detections have plunged
under 100 000.
In the Central Mediterranean area, the large
number of detections in 2011, which suddenly
increased following the Arab Spring in Tunisia
and Libya, had been significantly reduced by
the end of 2011. However, throughout 2012,
detections steadily increased and by the end
of the year they totalled more than 10 300.
Starting from 2008, considerable numbers
of migrants had been detected crossing illegally the border between Turkey and Greece,
along the so-called Eastern Mediterranean
route. The situation changed dramatically in
August 2012 when the Greek authorities mobilised unprecedented resources at their land
border with Turkey, including the deployment
of 1 800 additional Greek police officers. The
number of detected illegal border-crossings
rapidly dropped from about 2 000 in the first
week of August to below 10 per week in October 2012.
The enhanced controls along the Greek-Turkish land border led to a moderate increase in
detections of illegal border-crossing in the
Aegean Sea and at the land border between
Bulgaria and Turkey, but simultaneous mitiga-

tion efforts in Turkey and Bulgaria have so far
contained the displacements. There remains
the risk of resurgence of irregular migration,
since many migrants may be waiting for the
conclusion of the Greek operations before
they continue their journey towards Europe.
Many migrants who cross the border illegally to Greece move on to other Member
States, mostly through the land route across
the Western Balkans. Contrary to the decrease at the Greek-Turkish land border, there
was no decrease in detections of illegal border-crossing on the Western Balkan route
(6 390, +37%).
In 2012, in the Western Mediterranean area
between North Africa and Spain, detections
of illegal border-crossing decreased by nearly
a quarter compared to 2011 but remained
above the levels recorded in previous years
(6 400, -24%).
In 2012, Afghans remained the most detected
nationality for illegal border-crossing at EU
level, but their number considerably dropped
compared to 2011. Syrians stand out, with
large increases in detections of illegal bordercrossing and for using fraudulent documents
compared to 2011. Most of the detected Syrians applied for asylum in the EU, fleeing the
civil war in their country.
There were large increases in refusals of entry at the Polish land border with Belarus and

5 of 80

Frontex · annual risk analysis 2013

Ukraine. However, these increases were offset by a decrease in refusals of entry issued
at other border sections, resulting in a stable total at EU level compared to 2011 (-3%,
115 000 refusals of entry).
Detections of illegal stayers, which totalled
about 350 000 in the EU in 2012, have shown
a stable but slightly declining long-term trend
since 2008. Most migrants detected illegally
staying in the EU were from Afghanistan and
Morocco.
Despite a short-term increase of 10% between
2011 and 2012, the overall trend of detections
of facilitators of irregular migration has been
falling since 2008, totalling about 7 700 in
2012. This long-term decline may be in part
due to a widespread shift towards the abuse
of legal channels (such as overstaying, abuse
of visa-free regime, etc.) and document fraud,
which results in facilitators being able to operate remotely and inconspicuously.
In 2012, there were around 8 000 detections
of migrants using fraudulent documents to
enter the EU or Schengen area illegally.
Preliminary data on asylum applications in
2012 indicate an overall increase of about 7%
compared to the previous year. While Afghans
continue to account for the largest share of
applications, much of the increase was due
to an increasing number of applications submitted by Syrian nationals.
The number of asylum applications submitted
in the EU by Western Balkan citizens, mostly
those from Serbia, remained unabated in 2012.
Consequently, following the implementation
of the visa facilitation agreement with five
Western Balkan countries that started at
the end of 2009, there are now discussions
in the EU about the possible reintroduction
of the visa regime.

In 2012, there was a steady trend of about
160 000 third-country nationals effectively
returned to third countries. Greece reported
the largest number of returns of a single nationality (Albanians), and effective returns in
Greece increased markedly in the last quarter of 2012 following the launch of the Xenios
Zeus operation.
Looking ahead, the assessment of risks along
the EU’s external borders shows that despite
a sharp reduction in detections between 2011
and 2012, the risks associated with illegal border-crossing along the land and sea external
borders remain among the highest, in particular in the southern section of the border of the EU.
The risk of illegal border-crossing along the
land borders of the Eastern Mediterranean
route, including the Greek and Bulgarian land
border with Turkey, is assessed amongst the
highest. This comes after several years of large
numbers of migrants detected at the Greek
land border with Turkey. Although the flow
abruptly stopped in August 2012, there are reports of uncertainties related to the sustainability of the efforts and growing evidence that
migrants are waiting in Turkey for the end of
the operation. Increases at the neighbouring
sea border (Aegean Sea), at the land border
between Bulgaria and Turkey and increases
in detections of document fraud from Istanbul airports, although so far relatively small,
indicate that alternatives to the Greek land
border are being explored by facilitators.
Many of the migrants who crossed illegally
through the Eastern Mediterranean route
are expected to continue making secondary
movements across the Western Balkans and
within the EU.
The risk of illegal border-crossing across the
Central Mediterranean area was also assessed
amongst the highest due the continued volatile situation in countries of departure in

North Africa. Crisis situations are still likely to
arise at the southern border with thousands
of people trying to cross the border illegally
in the span of several weeks or months. Past
experiences also show that these crises take
their toll on human lives, and are very difficult to predict and quell without a coordinated response.
Most risks associated with document fraud
were assessed as high. Indeed, document
fraudsters not only undermine border security but also the internal security of the
EU. These risks are also common to nearly
all Member States, as they are associated
with passenger flows and border checks,
which are a specific expertise of bordercontrol authorities.

Fraud is expected mostly among EU travel
documents (e.g. passports, visas and ID cards).
False pretence or deception is used to obtain a wide range of documents. The most
common technique is to use fraudulent documents to obtain short-term visas.
Most risks associated with the abuse
of legal channels are assessed as high
as they are common and widely spread
phenomena.
Based on currently available information, the
risks associated with cross-border criminality are assessed as moderate, including the
risks of trafficking in human beings, terrorism, smuggling of illicit drugs and exit of stolen vehicles.

1. Introduction
The Annual Risk Analysis 2013 is intended to
facilitate and contribute to informed decisions
on investments and concerted actions that
are most likely to have sustainable effects on
the management of the external borders and
ultimately on the internal security of the EU.
The ARA conclusions and identified risks at
the EU’s external borders are meant to help
effectively balance and prioritise the allocation of resources.
Frontex operational activities aim to
strengthen border security by ensuring the
coordination of Member States’ actions in
the implementation of Community measures
relating to the management of the external
borders. The coordination of operational activities also contributes to better allocation
of Member States’ resources and protection
of the area of freedom, security and justice.
The ARA 2013 concentrates on the current
scope of Frontex operational activities, which

8 of 80

focus on irregular migration at the external borders of the EU and the Schengen Associated Countries. Central to the concept
of integrated border management (IBM),
border management should also cover security threats present at the external borders. Hence, a full section is devoted to the
phenomenon of trafficking in human beings
(THB), the combating of which was tasked
to Frontex pursuant to the EU action plan
(2005/C 311/01) on best practices, standards
and procedures for combating and preventing THB.
The Frontex Risk Analysis Unit (RAU) would
like to express its gratitude to all members
of the Frontex Risk Analysis Network (FRAN)
in Member States for their efforts in providing data and information, as well as Europol,
EASO and the European Commission, which
have contributed to the ARA 2013, and all
Frontex colleagues involved in the preparation of this report.

2. Methodology
2.1. Data exchange
A coherent and full analysis of the risks affecting security at the external borders requires,
above all, the adoption of common indicators. Consistent monitoring of these indicators will then allow effective measures to be
taken on the ground. The analysis will need
to identify the risks that arise at the external borders themselves and those that arise
in third countries.
The backbone of the ARA 2013 is the monthly
statistics exchanged between Member States
within the framework of the Frontex Risk
Analysis Network (FRAN). This regular dataexchange exercise was launched in September
2007 and then refined in 2008. Thanks to the
FRAN members’ efforts, a much larger statistical coverage was achieved in 2011, focusing
on seven key indicators of irregular migration:
(1) detections of illegal border-crossing, (2) refusals of entry, (3) detections of illegal stay,
(4) asylum applications, (5) detections of facilitators, (6) detections of forged documents
and (7) return decisions and effective returns.
Following the closing of the CIREFI working
group in April 2010, most of its mandate, in
particular those concerning the exchange of
data, were transferred to the FRAN. Most
indicators monitored by CIREFI had already
been part of the monthly data exchange
among FRAN members and only the statistics on returns had to be added as the seventh indicator of the regular data exchange
as of January 2011.

In 2011, the original FRAN indicator on forged
documents was updated to enable the analysis of complex modi operandi. Following a
successful pilot study, the European Union Document-Fraud Risk Analysis Network (EDF-RAN) was formed in early 2012
to oversee the exchange of a much more
comprehensive and detailed indicator on document fraud, including the abuse of genuine
documents.
Member States were not requested to answer specific questions in support of this
analysis. Rather, bi-monthly analytical reports and incident reports of Member States
routinely collected within the FRAN and
Member States’ contributions to several Tailored Risk Analyses produced in 2012 were
both important sources of information, especially as regards the analysis of routes and
modi operandi.
Open-source information was also effectively
exploited, especially in identifying the main
push and pull factors for irregular migration to
the EU. Among others, these sources included
reports issued by government agencies, international and non-governmental organisations, as well as official EU reports, such as
the European Commission’s reports on third
countries, and mainstream news agencies.
The data exchanged within the FRAN are
compiled and analysed on a quarterly basis. Priority is given to the use of the data for
management purposes and to its fast sharing

9 of 80

Frontex · annual risk analysis 2013

among Member State border-control authorities. Member States’ data that are processed
by Frontex are not treated as official statistics,
and thus may occasionally vary from the data
officially published by national authorities.
Throughout 2012, some FRAN Members performed backdated updates of their 2011 statistics. These updates have been accounted for
in this document and so some data presented
here may differ from the data presented a
year ago in the 2012 Annual Risk Analysis.
External borders refer to the borders between Member States and third countries.
The borders between the Schengen Associated Countries (Norway, Iceland and Switzerland) and third countries are also considered
as external borders. The borders between the
Schengen Associated Countries and Schengen Member States are considered as internal borders. For the indicators on detections
of facilitators, illegal stay and asylum, statistics are also reported for detections at the
land borders between the Schengen Member States and Schengen candidates (Bulgaria,
Romania) or non-Schengen Member States
(the UK, Ireland), so that a total for Member
States and the Schengen Associated Countries as a whole can be presented. It was not
possible to make this distinction for air and
sea borders because Member States do not
habitually differentiate between extra-EU and
intra-EU air and sea connections but tend
to aggregate data for all arrivals per airport.

Conservative estimates of the number of irregular migrants within the EU vary between
three and six million, according to the results
of Clandestino, an EU-sponsored project implemented by the ICMPD. Other estimates
put the figure of irregular migrants at eight
million, of which 80% are staying inside the
Schengen area, half of them having originally
entered it legally. However, there is currently
no estimate of the annual flow of irregular
migrants crossing the border illegally.

2.2. Quality of available data

Information on national-level resources for
border-control authorities and their allocation is currently only partially known. These
data are provided by Member States themselves either within the Schengen evaluation
mechanism or within the External Borders
Fund reporting. Without systematic and reliable information on resources allocated to
border control and without estimates of irregular migration flows, it is not possible to
assess the performance and impact of the
border controls put in place, and the analyses of the situation at the EU’s external borders are limited to descriptive statistics of
the administrative data provided by Member States.

Consistent with other law-enforcement indicators, variation in administrative data related to border control depends on several
factors. In this case, the number of detections

As highlighted in the Schengen Catalogue,
variation in regular passenger flow is an important factor to be taken into account in the
allocation of border-control resources. How-

In turn, Europol contributed to the ARA 2013
by providing information on facilitated irregular migration. EASO also contributed to the
section on asylum applications.

10 of 80

of illegal border-crossing and refusals of entry are both functions of the amount of effort spent detecting migrants and the actual
flow of irregular migrants to the EU. For example, increased detections of illegal bordercrossing might be due to a real increase in the
flow of irregular migrants, or may in fact be
an outcome of more resources made available to detect migrants. In exceptional cases,
increased resources may produce a rise in reported detections while effectively masking
the actual decrease in the flow of migrants,
resulting from a strong deterrent effect.

ever, regular flows of passengers across the
EU’s external borders are currently not recorded systematically.
Data on the number of EU visas issued and
their places of issue would improve the characterisation of third-country passenger flows.
However, this information, which is collected
within the Council Visa Working Party and
published by the European Commission, is
not yet available for 2012. For the purpose
of the ARA, data from 2008 to 2011 are discussed as an introduction to the general situation at the borders.

2.3. Application of the Common
Integrated Risk Analysis Model
(CIRAM)
A key development in the CIRAM 2.0 update released in 2011 was the adoption of a
management approach to risk analysis that
defines risk as a function of the threat, vul-

nerability and impact. Such an approach endeavours to reflect the spirit of the Schengen
Borders Code and the Frontex Regulation,
both of which emphasise risk analysis as a
key tool in ensuring the optimal allocation of
resources within constraints of budget, staff
and efficiency of equipment.
According to the model, a ‘threat’ is a force
or pressure acting upon the external borders
that is characterised by both its magnitude
and likelihood; ‘vulnerability’ is defined as the
capacity of a system to mitigate the threat
and ‘impact’ is determined as the potential
consequences of the threat. In this way, the
structured and systematic breakdown of risk
presented as conclusion provides for an assessment of the relative overall risks posed by
different threats as a function of the relevant
vulnerabilities and impact, and therefore will
be of much use to decision-makers in setting
priorities, in formulating counter-measures
and designating operational targets.

3. Situational picture in 2012
3.1. Passenger flow across the
EU’s external borders
Passenger flow is an indicator of the volume
of checks that border guards have to perform,
relative to the number of border guards. Citizens enjoying free movement are subject to
minimum checks, while third-country nationals, whether they require visas or not, are subject to more thorough checks, as defined by
the Schengen Borders Code. Hence, the nature and extent of passenger flow determine
to a large extent the planning and allocation
of resources for border checks.
Passenger flow data also prove useful in analysing indicators of irregular migration, in
particular refusals of entry and detections
of document fraud. Indeed, differences in the
rates of refusal of entry over passenger flow
may help identify best practice and eventually ensure that checks are performed in a
harmonised way across the BCPs of the EU.
Similarly, detections of document fraud are
most effectively analysed in connection with
passenger flows and detection rates, rather
than the number of detections, and provide
the most useful tool for assessing border
checks and flows of document fraudsters.
At European level there is no systematic reporting on passenger flows by BCP, border
section or as a total for the EU’s external border. Member States reported data on passenger flow in the framework of the European

Borders Fund (EBF), but this excludes the
UK and Ireland, which do not participate in
the EBF, and including crossings between
non-Schengen and Schengen Member States
(France-UK, Belgium-UK, Romania-Hungary).
The total at the air border represents all passenger flows, including passengers from EU
countries. The EBF total for sea border crossing probably also includes crossings between
Member States. Given these uncertainties,
it is difficult to estimate the EU total passenger flow from third countries that could
usefully be analysed against the number of
refusals of entry and detections of fraudulent documents.
Air borders
Eurostat provides data on air passenger flow
(EU nationals and third-country nationals)
coming only from third countries, which totalled 125 million in 2011, including the UK and
Ireland. At the air borders, estimates derived
from Eurostat data released in January 2013,
show a steady trend of + 1% in arrivals from
third countries between 2010 and 2011, at a
total of about 125 million arrivals from outside
the EU in 2011. The UK, Germany and France
ranked amongst the first, with more than 20
million arrivals from third countries. Italy and
the Netherlands follow at a distance with less
than 10 million arrivals from third countries.
The largest numbers of arrivals are reported
from the airport of London Heathrow with

13 of 80

Frontex · annual risk analysis 2013

approximately 17 million passengers, followed
by Paris-Charles De Gaulle airport (13 million)
and Frankfurt airport (11 million). At Frankfurt airport, as at many airports in the EU,
the top priority is now on reducing the time
for check-in, security and passport control.
Land borders
At the external land borders of the EU, although there is no systematic collection of
passenger flow data at EU level, the busiest
border section for entries of passengers is
probably the border between Slovenia and
Croatia, with approximately 23 million annual
entries. The land border between Spain and
Morocco is also a very busy border section,
totalling more than 10 million annual entries
(for both Ceuta and Melilla). The land border
between Poland and Ukraine, with approximately seven million passengers annually, also
belongs to the busiest land border sections.

Along the eastern land border, stretching for
more than 4 000 km from Romania to Finland, one recurring pattern is the strong seasonality of regular passenger flows, with most
of the crossings (entry/exit) taking place during the summer months. This requires an optimal mobilisation of resources during this
period to avoid undue waiting time for bona
fide travellers.
Passenger flows are widely expected to increase at the land borders in the coming
years, in particular along the main BCPs at
the land borders with the Russian Federation, Ukraine and Turkey. While all BCPs are
equipped to meet the standards required
by the Schengen Borders Code, differences
in the nature of the flow of passengers and
commercial traffic explains the differences in
staffing levels between BCPs. A study* performed by the Center for the Study of Democracy, based on Member States answers
for 2009, shows that there can be important
differences in the characteristics of BCPs.

3.2. Visa
Visa policy acts as a form of pre-entry procedure to ensure that third-country nationals comply with entry requirements, which
helps to prevent irregular migration. In this
respect, particularly important in preventing subsequent illegal staying is the role of
consular offices in third countries determining whether a third-country national
should be granted a visa or not. Member
States have introduced a variety of specific
measures in their visa-issuing procedures to
tackle irregular migration, which includes
the assessment of willingness to return, the
training of personnel at embassies and consulates, and cooperation and information
exchange with other entities and Member
States. Other preventive measures include
the use of biometric data in the visa application process, as well as the identification
of specific categories of migrants who might
misuse their visa and awareness raising in
third countries of the consequences of making fraudulent applications.**
The Community Code on Visas, which entered into force in April 2010, sets out the
common requirements for issuing transit
and short-term visas to enter the territor y of Member States. There are currently over 100 nationalities that require
a visa to enter the EU, covering more than
80% of non-EU population of the world.
Nevertheless, about one billion nationals from approximately 40 third countries
do not require an EU visa. These include
Australia, Canada, Croatia, Japan, New
Zealand and the USA. The list of countries whose nationals require a visa to
travel to the UK or Ireland differs slightly
from other EU countries. As indicated in
the Visa Code, statistical data are an important means of monitoring migratory
movements and can serve as an efficient
management tool.

Recent changes to Schengen regulations
have seen a simplification of the visa regime. Schengen Member States now issue
only three types of visa: (1) airport transit visa (A) – valid only for airport transit,
does not entitle the holder to leave the
transit zone of the airport; (2) short-stay
visa (C); (3) national long-stay visas (D)
and residence permits. Generally, a shortstay visa issued by one of the Schengen
States (visa C) entitles its holder to travel

throughout the 26 Schengen States for up
to three months within a six-month period. Visas for visits exceeding that period
remain subject to national procedures. The
data include visas issued by the Schengen Associated Countries (Iceland, Norway, Switzerland), as well as by Romania
and Bulgaria, which have not yet joined
the Schengen area, and exclude visa data
in the UK and Ireland, which are not part
of the Schengen area.

Data for 2012 are not yet available, but the
European Commission, through its DG Home
Affairs has released the data for 2011. VIS
data are collected on the basis of the place
where the application is made, and not on
the citizenship of the visa applicant. Thus, for
instance, applications made in the Russian
Federation do not necessarily concern only
Russian nationals. However, in the following
overview, the country where the visas were
delivered was used as the most suitable approximation of the visas issued to citizens of
that country. Visas broken down by nationalities are available at the national level, where
they can be used for operational purposes.

In 2011 more than 13.8 million visas (all
types) were issued by Schengen and nonSchengen Member States (including Bulgaria and Romania, but excluding the UK
and Ireland). The vast majority of visas issued were category C, or short-stay visas,
accounting for 98% of all visas issued, followed by long-stay visas (2%) and airport
transit (A) visas (0.1%).
The annual increase of 4% between 2010 and
2011 increased the number of visas to a level
similar to that of 2007, i.e. before the economic crisis hit the EU and significantly reduced the number of visitors.

Consistent with every year since 2007, in
2011 the Russian Federation was where most
short-term visas were issued (5 556 941) representing a 24% increase compared to the
previous year. Visas issued in the top three
countries account for 58% of all short-stay
visas issued in 2011. Figure 3 illustrates the
number of visas issued in 2010 and 2011 for
the top five third countries in 2011 (circle
size) and the degree of change (slopes) between the years.
This significant increase in the number of visas issued in the Russian Federation is similar to the increase of 28% observed between
2009 and 2010. In total, short-term visas issued in the Russian Federation accounted for
41% of all category C visas issued by Member
States in 2011. Ukraine followed with 1 270 157
visas issued in 2011 marking an increase of
20% compared to 2010. As in 2010, China,
ranked third with 1 031 866, saw the most
significant increase in the number of visas
issued from 2010 to 2011, i.e. by 31% and so it
is shown at the top of Figure 3.

Overstaying the legal visa period
There are no data available on the rate of
people who arrive on short-term visas but
do no depart before their visa expires (overstaying). However, experiences from countries implementing entry-exit systems, like
Australia or Thailand, showed that such indicator can be useful for decision-makers
when assessing visa applications. Indeed,
it is generally believed that overstaying is
a very common modus operandi for irregular migration to the EU.
Visa refusals
The consulate competent for dealing with
visa applications assesses:

18 of 80

1.	whether the applicant fulfils the entry
conditions;
2. the risk of irregular immigration;
3.	the applicant’s intention to leave the territory of the Member State before the expiry of the visa;
4.	whether the applicant presents a risk to
the security or public health of the Member State.
As a result, some visa applications are refused. There are no data on the reasons for
refusals of visa applications, but the overall
refusal rate for visa applications may be determined per third country where visas are
issued. Combined with additional information and tailored to operational needs, the
rate of refusals of visa in consulates may be
used by border-control authorities to deter-

mine the countries of origin presenting the
highest risk of irregular migration.
In 2011, about 6% of the 14 373 334 visa applications were rejected. This proportion rose to
32% for applications made in West Africa, and
to 20% in the Caribbean. Visa refusal rates
varied widely between Member States, from
17% of 242 857 applications in Belgium to 1%
of 1 259 643 applications in Finland.
UK visas
In 2011 for the UK alone, data on entry clearance visas and admissions of those who are
subject to immigration control coming to the
UK for study, work and family reasons show
that: student immigration has seen a general
increase since 2005, rising particularly rapidly in 2009; work-related immigration has
fallen overall since 2006; and family immigration has shown a slow overall decrease since
2006. The latest visa data for 2011 indicate
the number of student visas has fallen since
a peak in the year ending June 2010 and work
visas have continued to fall after a slight increase in the year ending March 2011. Visas
for family reasons also fell.
Excluding visitor and transit visas, 6% fewer
visas were issued in 2011 (564 000) than in
2010 (597 000). However, there were a record 1.7 million visitor visas issued in 2011, 11%
more than a year earlier (1.5 million).*
In total, the UK issued 2 272 891 visas, with
a refusal rate of 12%. The UK Border Agency
(UKBA) published extensive statistics on visas issued, including breakdown by nationalities, but also by categories of visa (work,
student, family, other) and categories of sponsors, broken down by nationalities and places
of delivery.

Resident permits
An EMN note released in September 2012**
showed that more than 1.93 million first residence permits were issued in 2011, an increase
of 15% compared to 2010. This total excludes
Belgium, Cyprus and Poland, which amounted
to some 188 400 residence permits in 2010.
Most residence permits were issued by Italy
(331 000) and France (193 400).

At EU level, the Single Permit Directive was
adopted in December 2011. The new legislation provides for a single application procedure for a single permit for third-country
nationals to reside and work on the territory
of a Member State. Negotiations continued
on the proposals for directives on the conditions of entry and residence of third-country
nationals for the purpose of seasonal employment and on conditions of entry and
residence of third-country nationals in the
framework of an intra-corporate transfer.
Infringement procedures for non-communication of national measures transposing the
EU Blue Card Directive*** were launched in
2011 in respect of six Member States. In 2012,
a second set of infringement procedures were
launched in respect of five Member States.

3.3. Illegal border-crossing
Detections of illegal border-crossing along
the EU’s external borders sharply dropped
in 2012 to 72 437 detections, a 49% decrease
compared to 2011 due mainly to the combined effects of enhanced surveillance at
the land border between Greece and Turkey,
where detections decreased by 44%, and to
a sharp drop in the Central Mediterranean,
where detections fell from 59 000 in 2011,
mostly in connection to the Arab Spring, to
10 379 in 2012 (-82%).

compared to the peak period of February–
September 2011 that registered most of the
departures connected to people leaving Tunisia and Libya. Most detections of illegal border-crossing along the external borders were
on the South-Eastern border of the EU. The
situation changed drastically in August 2012
when the Greek authorities mobilised unprecedented resources at their land border with
Turkey, including the deployment of 1 800 additional Greek Police Officers. Detections of
illegal border-crossing rapidly dropped from
about 2 000 in the first week of August to
less than 10 per week in October 2012.
Looking at nationalities, despite an over 43%
reduction compared to 2011, at 13 169 detections, Afghans still accounted for 18% of all detections of illegal border-crossing at EU level.
The majority of these Afghan migrants was
detected at the land border between Greece
and Turkey, where detections fell after August
2012. Afghans continued to be detected making secondary movement across the Hungarian land border with Serbia.

were Syrians, both in terms of relative growth
and absolute number, from 1 616 in 2011 to
7 903 in 2012 (+389%). A large majority of all
detected Syrian migrants were reported from
the Greek land border with Turkey. Migrants
from Eritrea (5 038 detections in 2012, +67%)
and Somalia (2 604, +66%) were increasingly
detected in the Central Mediterranean route.
3.3.1. Routes
In the annual total for 2012, detections of illegal border-crossing on the Eastern Mediterranean route still accounted for the largest
percentage of all detections (37 214, 51% of
2012 total). Many migrants who crossed
the border illegally to Greece continue to
other Member States, either through the
land route across the Western Balkans, or
through ferry links to Italy or by air to other
Schengen Member States.
Throughout 2012, detections in the Central
Mediterranean region steadily increased to
reach an annual total of 10 379 (14% of the total). Most migrants were from sub-Saharan
countries and departed from Libya.
In the Western Mediterranean area, at the
land and sea borders between northern Africa
and Spain, detections of illegal border-crossing totalled 6 397, representing a 24% decrease
compared to 2011. This level is comparable to
the detections reported in 2008 and 2010.
Most migrants were Algerians or sub-Saharans departing from Morocco and Algeria.

In March 2012, Belarusian authorities appeared to relax their border surveillance,
resulting in increased detections of illegal
border-crossing in Lithuania and Poland.
Compared to 2011, detections increased by
52% along the eastern land border, totalling
nearly 1 600. However, as was the case in
previous years, this total represented only a
small fraction of all detections in the EU (2%).

Figure 5. Detections of illegal border-crossing along the EU’s external borders plunged
in 2012 mainly due to enhanced surveillance at the Greek-Turkish land border and
a sharp drop in the Central Mediterranean

n Eastern Mediterranean route
Since data collection began in early 2008,
the Eastern Mediterranean has maintained
its status as a hotspot of irregular migration.
Detections have followed a remarkably seasonal pattern invariably peaking in the third
quarter of each year and concentrated at the
border between Greece and Turkey. However, following the implementation of a set
of Greek operations in August 2012 as well
as the continued implementation of Fron-

22 of 80

tex-coordinated JOs (Aeneas, Hermes and
Poseidon Sea), by the end of the year, detections dropped off to almost negligible levels.
The operation Xenios Zeus focuses on inland
detections of illegal stay in Greece and their
subsequent return, while the operation Aspida enhances the surveillance on the GreekTurkish land border.
The operational activities included:
(a)	deployment of a 1 881 additional Police

nical assets at the Greek-Turkish land
border aimed at increasing surveillance
and response capacity to tackle illegal
border-crossing;
(b)	creation of significant additional capacity
for hosting irregular migrants in detention centres in order to be able to facilitate identification and return;
(c)	use of new tactics for border surveillance
and improved cooperation with the Turkish authorities at the border;
(d)	reduction in the time period for which irregular migrants have to leave Greece if
not held in detention centres from 30 to
7 days; and
(e)	inland activities for the detection of irregular migrants on Greek territory.
As a result, from 6 August 2012 onwards
the number of apprehensions significantly
dropped at the Greek-Turkish land border.
The operations produced a slight shift to
the Bulgarian land border and the sea border with Turkey. Italy reported a few detections of migrants attempting to cross directly
from Turkey, and at EU level, Member States
also reported a small increase in detections

of migrants with fraudulent documents on
flights departing from Istanbul. However,
these increases in detections on alternative
route to the land border between Turkey
and Greece, do not match previous levels, as
seen in Figure 6.
The operations were initially planned for a
three month period, but were then renewed
in October 2012 for another three month period. In January 2013, the Greek authorities
announced the 3rd phase of the operation
Aspida, which will run until 3 April 2013 with
1 100 police officers deployed in Evros region.
Partial shift to sea borders
Detections in the Aegean Sea, between
Turkey and Greece, increased by 912%. This
increasing trend started after September
2012, as migrants considered sea crossing as
an alternative to the land route to Greece.
It is indeed at the sea borders where the
most significant shift in detections of illegal border-crossing was reported. The increase started immediately following the
enhanced surveillance at the land border.

23 of 80

Frontex · annual risk analysis 2013

Worryingly, detections were still relatively
large at the end of year, despite the winter
conditions that makes sea crossing more
treacherous. This may signal a resurgence
of the pressure in the Aegean Sea after
three years of relatively low detections.
Indeed, in 2009, the Aegean Sea was the
main area for detections of illegal bordercrossing into the EU.
Migrants detected in the Aegean Sea were
mainly apprehended inland after their arrival
from the western coast of Turkey, while a
small number of migrants were apprehended
directly at sea trying to reach the Greek Aegean Islands. The most targeted islands were
Lesbos, Samos, Agathonisi, Farmakonisi and
Symi. Most migrants had departed from Izmir
on the Western Turkish coast.
The Turkish authorities have also stepped up
their surveillance efforts, with the Turkish
Coast Guards intercepting migrants in rubber boats and vessels before they reach the
Greek territorial waters.
In the Ionian Sea, there was no significant increase after August 2012. Most of
the migrants detected in the Ionian Sea
had departed from Greece, after having
crossed the border illegally between Turkey and Greece.
Partial shift to the land border between
Bulgaria and Turkey
Since systematic data collection began in
early 2008, detections of illegal border-crossing at the Bulgarian-Turkish land border were
rather low. The situation changed in 2012,
when a total of around four times as many
migrants were apprehended. This increase
is connected to the strengthening of border control at the Greek-Turkish land border,
where most migrants used to cross illegally
into the EU, in August 2012.

24 of 80

The main nationalities apprehended in Bulgaria during 2012 were Syrians, Palestinians,
Iraqis, Algerians and Malians. Up until August there were very few sub-Saharan migrants detected at the Bulgarian-Turkish land
border; however, from the beginning of the
Greek operation Aspida until end of December 2012, their number rose to represent 16%
of all detections. Most sub-Saharan migrants
had arrived legally in Turkey by air (most of
them either do not need visa or can easily
obtain it on arrival in Turkey).
Following this increase, the Bulgarian authorities quickly reacted in October 2012 by
setting-up a Specialised Police Operation at
the Bulgarian-Turkish land border in the areas of the Border Police Units of Svilengrad
and Elhovo, deploying additional officers, patrol cars and service dogs along the Bulgarian-Turkish border. Measures have also been
taken to enhance air surveillance.
These actions complement the efforts of the
Bulgarian authorities to implement an Integrated Border Surveillance System at the
border section between the BCP Kapitan Andreevo and Lesovo. The system covers 58 km
of the most affected section of the Bulgarian-Turkish land border. The Bulgarian authorities are planning to extend the system
to cover the entire border section.
Staying in Turkey
Given the rather limited shift in detections
of migrants crossing illegally from Turkey, it
is also likely that a substantial proportion of
migrants failing or not trying to enter the EU
prefer to stay in Turkey, rather than returning to their more unstable and substantially
poorer home countries. Although lacking residency status, and, therefore, vulnerable to
exploitation, they may find jobs in specific
niches in the Turkish informal sector, tourism, petty trade, construction and agriculture.

Nationalities on the Eastern
Mediterranean route
There was some variation in the extent to
which detections of different nationalities
decreased in response to the operations.
However, the deterring effect was the least
pronounced in the case of Syrians as the detections of this nationality were the last to
decrease and the scale of their decline was
the smallest. In the second half of 2012, Syrians were by far the most detected nationality in this area.

Figure 7. Following enhanced control at the Greek-Turkish land
border, Syrians were the last to decrease. Compared to 2011,
detections of Syrians actually increased the most, while detections of
Afghans and Pakistanis significantly dropped in 2012

Although not reflected in the analysis of the
top nationalities, the number of Algerians
detected crossing illegally the border on the
Eastern Mediterranean route in 2012 (2 223
detections) was larger than the number of
Algerians detected on the Western Mediterranean route (2 015 detections), which is their
traditional route with direct departure from
the Algerian coast. This shift is explained by
cheap flight connections from Algeria to Turkey and the easiness to obtain Turkish visa.
Afghan migrants
Some reports state that in Iran there are currently 2–4 million displaced Afghans who have
been residing there for several years. However, an agreement of the Iranian government to provide Afghans with documents to
legalise their stay and provide permission to
work has recently expired, rendering many
Afghan nationals as illegal stayers in Iran.
Hence, many now-irregular migrants in this
situation are coming to the EU.
Pakistani migrants
Most migrants coming to the EU from Pakistan via the Greek-Turkish border, are single, male adults between the ages of 21 and
29, non-skilled Urdu-speaking workers and
students. When illegally crossing the external border they tend to travel undocumented.

The passports are often withheld by facilitators in Turkey with the assurance that they
will be sent to other facilitators in Greece.
The most frequent place of origin is the northern part of the Punjab province. According to
the statements provided in interviews, the
destination countries are Greece, Italy and
Spain, but considering the number of returned
Pakistani nationals, the UK could be the main
final destination country. The main Member
States reporting the effective return of Pakistanis were the UK and Greece.
The main reason why Pakistanis choose to
migrate to the EU is economic, because of a
lack of employment opportunities and very
low salaries in Pakistan.
Bangladeshi migrants
Most of the Bangladeshi migrants interviewed
after having illegally crossed the Greek-Turkish land border claimed that they had departed from countries around the Persian

25 of 80

Congo

Urmia and then crossed the Iranian-Turkish border in large groups of up to 1 000
migrants, and headed towards Van. In Van,
migrants received false Turkish documents
and used a regular bus connection to get
to Istanbul. From there, facilitators transported them to the River Evros, or alternative routes.

Gulf, where they had been legally working in

jobs were available; consequently, many migrants decided to try to reach the EU in search
of better employment opportunities. It was
established that facilitators working in the
Gulf area deceptively assured the migrants
that there were plenty of good jobs and high
salaries in Greece.
The Bangladeshi migrants travelled by car
to Oman, from where they crossed the Gulf
of Oman to Iran in fast speedboats. From
Bandar-E-Abbas they travelled on buses
and in vans to Teheran, where they joined
the flow of mostly Afghan and Pakistani
migrants arriving from the east. From Teheran, the migrants were transported to

Syrian migrants
While the increasing number of detections
of illegal border-crossing is generally linked
to the internal situation in Syria, the prevailing profile of Syrians detected at the GreekTurkish border remains somewhat different
to the refugee flow from Syria into Turkey.
Also, roughly 15% of Syrians detected at the
Greek-Turkish border during 2012 were in fact
not native to Syria. These false claims of nationality often occur in conjunction with new
or emerging crises and are linked to nationalities with common linguistic and/or geographical origin. In this case, migrants falsely
claiming Syrian nationality were mostly Iraqis
and, to a lesser extent, also Egyptians, Moroccans, Libyans and Tunisians.
Syrians detected crossing the border illegally
in Greece were predominantly male (74%),
while the UNHCR data for the refugee flow
into the neighbouring countries suggest that
75% were women and children. While there
were also family units detected, the majority of Syrians arriving in Greece were youths
aged between 20 and 28.
The main areas of departure from Syria were
the north-west around the city of Aleppo, the
north-east around the city of Al Qamishli and
the capital Damascus. Migrants tended to
use cars and buses for legal entry to Turkey.
With the help of Syrian facilitators some also
enter Turkey illegally on foot, although this
is an exception. Importantly, while on route
to Greece, Syrians do not usually seek international protection in Turkey.

Some Syrians departing from Damascus
tended to travel legally to Beirut, fly to Istanbul and from there continue their journey to Greece with the help of the facilitators.
While staying in Istanbul, Syrians made contact with facilitators.
A German court ruled early in 2012 that Syrian nationals applying for international protection are to be granted automatic refugee
status on the grounds that the very act of
leaving Syria presumably illegally, and then
asking for international protection may, upon
return to Syria, result in torture and imprisonment. Sweden also declared that Syrian
nationals claiming for asylum would also
be automatically granted protection, while
other Member States are reviewing their
policies.
Secondary movements
Greece is a Schengen exclave and a transit rather than destination country for the
majority of migrants. Thus, the secondary
movements originating in Greece are characterised by a similar composition of nationalities of migrants attempting to re-enter the
Schengen area heading for their final destinations as those who enter Greece. In 2012,
these movements tended to be reflected in
the detections of:
1)	illegal border-crossing throughout the
Western Balkan land borders;
2)	migrants landing at the blue border of
the southern Italian regions of Apulia and
Calabria;
3)	clandestines and document fraudsters on
board ferries to Italy (Ancona, Venice);
4)	document fraudsters travelling on flights
from Greek airports to many major EU
airports.
Illegal border-crossing throughout the
Western Balkan land borders: There were
almost 35 000 detections of illegal bordercrossing between BCPs reported at borders

between Western Balkan countries themselves or at their borders with the neighbouring Member States. The number was
one third higher compared to 2011. Among
the top five border sections, Croatia-Slovenia reported the highest increases (+95%)
between 2011 and 2012. Afghans continued
to dominate the nationalities ranking with
a 23% share of the total. Their numbers rose
by almost 10% to 8 065, however, the highest relative increases between 2011 and 2012
were reported by Syrians (+1 689%), Somalis
(+223%) and Algerians.
Worth mentioning is also the fact that many
more migrants opted for clandestine entry
(hiding in lorries or trains) during 2012 compared to 2011. In fact, Western Balkan countries and the neighbouring Member States
detected almost 1 676 or 87% more persons
hiding in vehicles while trying to cross borders illegally. The top border section was Serbia-former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,
where authorities on both sides of the border detected 25% more than during 2011. As
in the case for green border crossings, Afghans were the top nationality with a 45%
share of the total.
Migrants landing at the blue border of
the southern Italian regions of Apulia and
Calabria: In 2012, there was a steady flow of
Afghans and, to a lesser extent, Pakistanis arriving in the southern Italian blue borders of
Calabria and Apulia with some very large increases during the third quarter of 2012. The
most commonly detected migrants were
from Afghanistan, representing a steady share
of about 30%. Detections of migrants from
Pakistan, Bangladesh and Syria increased very
sharply since the beginning of 2012.
Many migrants indicated that they had initially entered the Schengen area by crossing
the land border between Greece and Turkey.
In 2011, it was estimated that more than 15%
of migrants reported at the Greek–Turkish

27 of 80

Frontex · annual risk analysis 2013

land border were afterwards detected in
Apulia and Calabria.
Increasing numbers of other migrants, usually from Asia, claim to have been living in
Greece for a number of years before deciding to leave for other Member States because of the economic crisis. Some of the
migrants stated that they had been working in agriculture jobs for EUR 25–30 per
day, but many did not receive any salary for
a certain period which prompted their decision to leave.
Document fraudsters travelling on flights
from Greek airports to many major EU airports: In 2012, there were more than 500
detections of migrants travelling on intraSchengen flights with fraudulent documents.
These intra-Schengen document fraudsters
were mostly detected by Italy (entry and
exit) and Greece (exit), where numbers were
increasing throughout 2012 and, to a lesser
extent, by Germany (entry), where numbers
were decreasing.
Following recent increases, Syrians were
the most detected nationality on intraSchengen flights followed by Afghans and
Somalis.

n Central Mediterranean route
In the Central Mediterranean area, the large
and suddenly increased number of detections in 2011, following the turmoil in Tunisia
and Libya, had been significantly reduced
by the end of 2011. However, throughout
2012, detections steadily increased and by
the end of the year they totalled more than
10 000 detections. Most migrants were
from sub-Saharan countries (particularly
Eritrea and Somalia) and departed from
Libya.
The institutional capacity to tackle irregular
migration in North Africa remains limited.
Libya is of the biggest concern in this respect
given its fractured, with four regions declared
military zones, non-consolidated and difficultto-govern emerging institutional framework.
The country is still plagued with frequent killings and kidnappings.
In the Central Mediterranean area, migrants illegally crossing the borders to the
EU used a wide variety of boats, ranging
from small rubber dinghies up to mediumsize wooden fishing boats. Fishing boats
departing from Libya were more difficult
to find after the wake of departures during

Figure 9. In 2012, there was a steady increase in detections on the Central Mediterranean
route, mostly sub-Saharans departing from Libya

the ‘Arab Spring’, and are often overloaded.
Rubber boats, the cheapest alternative to
the wooden fishing boats, are prone to
capsizing in high-sea conditions and have
often been equipped with poor engines,
two factors contributing to increasingly
put migrant lives at risk. From Tunisia, migrants sailing without facilitation often do
so aboard small rubber boats, whereas facilitation networks continue to advertise
sea crossings on wooden fishing boats.

The decreasing trend in departures from
Tunisia is expected to be reinforced by enhanced patrol capacities of the Tunisian authorities. In December, Tunisia received two
patrol boats, from the Italian Ministry of Interior to support the fight against clandestine migration from Tunisia to Italy. A third
boat of the same type will be handed over
in early 2013.

Most migrants departed from Libya and about
a quarter had left from Tunisia and a minority from Egypt.

Most sub-Saharans detected in the Central Mediterranean area in particular from
Eritrea and Somalia, reported to have departed from Libya, in particular from the
coastal areas near Tripoli, Zawiya and
Benghazi.

In addition, a few migrants detected near Sicily and the southern Italian coast mentioned
that they had left from Turkey or were detected after transiting through the Greek
Island of Crete, sometimes arriving in Crete
from Athens.

From Libya

Different routes are used to bring the migrants to the Libyan border. In some cases,
migrants have been reported leaving as far
away as Chad.

From Tunisia
From Egypt
The number of Tunisians detected on the
Central Mediterranean route significantly
dropped after September 2012, when an
agreement was reached between Italy and
Tunisia to repatriate up to 100 Tunisians
per week. This also coincided with rougher
sea conditions and the capsizing of a boat
soon after its departure during which as
many as 50 casualties have been reported.
All these factors contributed to deter many
Tunisians from illegally crossing the Mediterranean Sea.
While most departures from Tunisia in the
first half of the year took place from southern
Tunisia, there was of shift to more departures
from the northern part of the country as of
September, most probably due to the worsening weather conditions south and west of
the Pelagic Islands.

In 2012, the first detections for illegal border-crossing in the Central Mediterranean
area from Egypt occurred in April. Alexandria
was mentioned as the main area for departures. Most migrants were promptly readmitted to Egypt.
Nationalities on the Central
Mediterranean route
Somali migrants
Most detected Somalis were young males
(18–24 years) with secondary education and
low or no income. The main reason for the
migration was socio-economic, but in some
cases it was military conflict. Many Somali
migrants mentioned escaping the threat of
the terrorist group Al Shabab.

Most Somalis were detected by Italian authorities, but in the second quarter of 2012,
the arrival of Somali migrants in Malta increased significantly to almost 600 during
that quarter. They had been promised that
they would be brought to Italy. In the past,
Malta resettled some Somali migrants in the
United States and in some Member States,
which might be a pull factor.
Somali migrants are also among the most
commonly detected nationalities using fraudulent documents on intra-Schengen flights.

30 of 80

Most Tunisian migrants were young (18–29
years) unmarried males with a primary level
of education and low incomes. Many Tunisians have relatives or friends in the EU ready
to help them settle in, especially in Italy. Tunisian migrants typically arrived undocumented
to avoid readmission because Italy and Tunisia cooperate with regard to the repatriation
of documented Tunisians. After reaching Italy,
they continue their journey to other Member States; the majority travel to France as
they speak French.
Egyptian migrants
Mostly Egyptian migrants detected crossing
the Mediterranean Sea to the EU are young
males (16–19 years), looking for economic opportunities in the EU or escaping the current
tensions between Coptic and Muslim communities. Most of them rely on facilitation
network operating in Alexandria. Once detected for illegal border-crossing, they are returned to Egypt under bilateral agreements.

Eritrean migrants

n Western Mediterranean route
(sea, Ceuta and Melilla land)

Many Eritrean nationals, after leaving their
home either to avoid military service or in the
hope of finding better living conditions, gather
in Kassala and then spend some time in the UN
refugee camp in Shagarab. They then move
further to Khartoum, where they stay a few
months or years either in employment or trying to find some type of job.

In the Western Mediterranean area, between
northern Africa and Spain, detection for illegal border-crossing totalled 6 397, representing a 24% decrease compared to 2011, a level
comparable to the detections reported between 2008 and 2010. Most migrants were
Algerians and sub-Saharans departing from
Morocco and Algeria.

Nationalities on the Western
Mediterranean route
Moroccan and Algerian migrants
Moroccan and Algerians migrants were
mostly single male adults aged 18–30 but
also a few minors. They spoke Arabic and,
to a lesser extent, French or English; having
relatives or friends in Member States, mainly
in France, Belgium, Germany and Spain, who
would help them find a job and settle within
the ethnic communities already established
in these countries. They were suffering from
a generalised lack of economic opportunities.
Sub-Saharan migrants (mostly departing
from Morocco)
While Moroccans themselves still wish to
migrate to the EU, Morocco can be a comparatively stable and wealthy country for
sub-Saharan migrants. Typically for transitional countries, Morocco is likely to attract sub-Saharans to migrate and settle in
Morocco, facilitated by reduced travel costs
and the increased demand for low and highskilled migrant labour.* This trend was confirmed by several reports of migrants who
indicated that an increasing number of migrants, including women and children, from
sub-Saharan African countries illegally enter
Morocco with the assistance of smugglers.
Most sub-Saharans were single adults aged
25–35. In general, they had a low level of education with a limited knowledge of French
and/or English. Most travelled through several African countries where they worked before arriving in Morocco; almost all of them
were undocumented to avoid repatriation after their disembarkation to Spain. Most had
relatives or friends in Member States, mainly
in Spain, France and Germany. Some of them
claimed socio-economic reasons as well as
fleeing from social unrest and armed conflicts
in their home countries as the main motives

for migrating. Less frequent factors for migrating were religious persecution and the
marginalisation of women. However, compared to previous years there appeared an
increasing number of pregnant women and
children, raising the concern that an increasing number of migrants embarking on this
route might end up in the hands of organised crime groups (OCGs) involved in trafficking in human beings. However, during
the border-crossing, no link could be established between their smuggling and possible
trafficking in human beings.
Modus operandi
Sea crossing
The boats departing from Algeria or Morocco were mostly rubber dinghies, and fibre
glass boats. In the Strait of Gibraltar, on average 8–12 migrants were detected on rubber
boats that normally have a limited capacity
of four persons.
Most migrants departed from the coastal
area between Tangiers and Ceuta. From Algeria, the cities of Mostaganem, Oran and
Chlef form a triangle where the facilitators
recruit, accommodate and organise the sea
crossing. The coastal area between Ghazaouet and Orán is the main departure area
used in order to reach the coast of Almeria.
Mostaganem, located on the north coast of
Algeria between Orán and Tenés, is used to
reach Murcia.

Land crossing
Due to the repeated attempts of illegal border-crossing by sub-Saharan migrants towards Melilla and Ceuta, the Moroccan Army
and Royal Gendarmerie strengthened the police surveillance in the north of the country.
In October 2012, the Spanish authorities
reported several attempts by migrants to

31 of 80

Frontex · annual risk analysis 2013

scale the fence to the enclave of Melilla.
Some of the attempts took place in broad
daylight, resulting in more than 300 people crossing the border illegally. Most of the
migrants were of sub-Saharan origin and
succeeded in jumping the barrier around
the Oro River. The autonomous city of Melilla has reinforced security along the border
to try to stem illegal border-crossing, deploying 40 additional Civil Guard officers,
according to the government’s delegate in
Melilla. According to media reports, the migrants jumped the six-metre fence equipped
with sticks and stones, which they used to
threaten civil guards.
This assault over the fence resulted in the
local open centre of Immigrant Temporary Stay Centre (CETI) becoming quickly
overcrowded. At one point, there were
853 people staying in the centre which
only has capacity for 480. Collaboration
with Moroccan security forces was crucial in foiling migrants’ attempts to scale
the fences. After October, no other incident was reported.

n Western African route
The police and repatriation agreements that
Spain signed with Senegal, Mauritania and
Morocco and the consequent high level of
cooperation between the Spanish, Senegalese and Mauritanian authorities performing joint patrols at sea and on the coastline
of Senegal and Mauritania have been a significant deterrent factor in preventing irregular migration flows from Senegal and
Mauritania towards the Canary Islands. JO
Hera throughout the past 6 years has contributed to close cooperation and daily coordination among the authorities involved in
preventing irregular immigration.
The level of the detections of illegal bordercrossing towards the Canary Islands remained
very low indeed in 2012 mostly opportunity
driven and regional, as the vast majority of
arrivals concerned Moroccan nationals. This
represents a steady declining trend from the
peak in 2006 of more than 31 600 migrants
arriving illegally in the Canary Islands.
n Western Balkan route
The Western Balkan route remained largely
a function of the transiting flow of migrants
that enter the EU at the Greek-Turkish borders and later continue towards other Member States through the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia, Serbia and Croatia. Migrants travelling within the EU from
Greece and further on to other destination
Member States usually use the fastest possible route to re-enter the Schengen area
(Hungary or Slovenia).

Considering also detections reported by
Western Balkan countries within the Western
Balkans Risk Analysis Network, there were
almost 35 000 detections of illegal bordercrossing between BCPs reported by West-

ern Balkan countries and their neighbouring
Member States during 2012. The number was
33% higher compared to 2011. Serbia was by
far the top reporting country in the region
with a 40% share of detections
Nationalities on the Western Balkan route
In fact, most of the growth was linked to secondary movements of Afghans, Pakistanis, Algerians, Somalis, Syrians and Moroccans en
route from Greece to other Member States.
Detections of Albanian nationals (Albanian
circular migration to Greece) remained stable in comparison with 2011.
It is notable that the numbers of detections of illegal border-crossing by Serbia and
­Croatia in the fourth quarter were higher
than of any Member State, including Greece.
More than two-thirds of all detections continued to be linked to migrants who have
entered the Western Balkans en route from
Greece. In terms of nationalities, Afghans
remained the largest nationality with more
than 8 000 detections. The number of detected Syrians continued to increase strongly
during the last quarter of 2012. By the end of
2012, there were 1 646 Syrians detected for
illegal border-crossing compared to only 92
during 2011.
By the end of 2012, nationals of Eritrea were
the fastest growing group of migrants: their
number rose from only 20 in the third quarter
to more than 300 during the fourth quarter.
Similarly nationals of Mali grew from only 3 in
the third quarter to 78 in the fourth quarter.
Variations in modi operandi
There is considerable variation in the modus
operandi considering the points of departure
(either straight from Greece or in several legs
inside the Western Balkans) and types of vehicles used (cars, buses, cargo/passenger trains).

The route straight from Greece via Western Balkan countries to the EU appears to
be more costly and organised, while the
route made in several legs through Western Balkan countries is cheaper and perhaps more improvised. Inside the Western
Balkan countries vehicles are most probably entered at the truck stops. However, according to the observations by the Western
Balkan countries, the lorry drivers are usually not aware that they are carrying irregular migrants.
These trends continue to suggest that more
migrants en route from Greece are opting
for crossing the regional and common borders hidden in vehicles. This modus operandi
contains a high risk of loss of life, especially
when closed hidden compartments are used
in cars, buses, trains, and containers.
Number of asylum applications to
circumvent entry provisions continued at
increasing pace
Overall asylum applications by the migrants
en route from Greece increased substantially
in most Western Balkan countries. Most notably, the increase was extremely high in
Montenegro +543%. Claiming asylum in Western Balkans itself and absconding afterwards
continues to grow as a part of the modus operandi to move from Greece towards other
Member States (secondary movements).
n Eastern land borders route
The eastern land borders route is, in effect,
an amalgam of detections of illegal bordercrossing reported by Lithuania, Slovakia, Romania, Hungary, Poland, Estonia, Finland and
Latvia. Despite the total length of all the border sections, detections tend to be lower than
on other routes possibly due to the long distances between major hubs and many countries of origins. Also visa fraud and counterfeit
border-crossing stamps tend to predominate

33 of 80

Frontex · annual risk analysis 2013

on this route, as opposed to detections of illegal border-crossing.
The number of detections of Somalis at the
Slovakian land border with Ukraine represented a steady long-term increase over
many years.
n Other routes
There was very little detection for illegal border-crossing elsewhere in the EU. In the Baltic Sea region, Member States reported only
25 detections in 2012. These detections were
related to very few events. In this region,
the main issue for authorities patrolling the
blue border is the non-systematic control of
pleasure boats.
3.3.2. Clandestine entry
Detections of illegal border-crossing at (rather
than between) BCPs are restricted to the external land and sea borders of the EU and to
detections that are confirmed clandestine
entries (e.g. hiding in means of transport).
Their volume is extremely low for the whole
of the EU, with 605 detections in 2012, especially compared with other indicators, such

as detections of illegal border-crossing between BCPs (72 437). However, the 2012 total is still the highest number of clandestine
entry detections since data collection began
for this indicator in 2009.
This method requires migrants to stay in
confinement for long periods of time, and is
known to put migrants lives at risk of suffocation and dehydration. Therefore, most of the
migrants detected hiding in vehicles at BCPs
are single young males, and do not travel in
more-vulnerable family groups.
There were also more detections within the
EU/Schengen area (3 467), which was also
the highest number recorded in recent years.
The geographical distribution of those detections sheds light on the direction of secondary
movements and the final destination countries selected by specific nationalities. For example, Italy, the UK and Romania reported
the greatest number of internally detected
clandestine migrants, mostly Afghans, Albanians and Algerians. For smuggling within the
EU, there are reports that the ferry route between the Greek ports of Patras and Igoumenitsa towards Italy are important, as are
routes from ports heading towards the UK.
In Italy, most Afghans were detected making secondary movements on ferries arriving in Venice from Greece, as well as recent
increases in the number of Palestinians on
ferries arriving in Venice and Ancona, where
both nationalities are often also detected
with fraudulent documents.

In 2012, clandestine entry in lorries was one of
the most frequent and increasingly detected
methods. A large proportion of the clandestines were detected with carbon dioxide detection or heartbeat detection devices.

At the BCPs on the land border between Bulgaria and Turkey, a big part of clandestine
entry is associated with the annual movement of Turkish ‘guest workers’, (about two
million pass annually through Kapitan Andreevo and Lesovo BCPs) going to and from
Turkey mainly to Germany, Belgium and the
Netherlands. Many of these migrants try to
smuggle relatives through the Bulgarian border (between two and three attempts are
detected each day during peak times of the
year – May to September).*
In the Western Balkans, detections of migrants hiding in vehicles continued to increase in 2012. There were almost 1 676 (87%
increase compared to 2011) migrants detected in vehicles at different regional BCPs
while trying to clandestinely avoid border
checks.
On trains
Detections of clandestine on trains concerned relatively few of the BCPs along the
EU’s external borders. However, in 2012,
Member States reported increasing reports of migrants hiding on trains as part
of the secondary movements of migrants
who initially entered illegally into the EU
via Turkey.

In containers / ships
Detections of migrants hiding in containers
on ships are low, and confined to the largest container ports of the EU. Yet, in some
ports, like in the port of Algeciras, there are
regular detections, mostly associated with
migrants hiding in lorries on the ferries between Morocco and Spain.

3.4. Detections of facilitators
Despite an increase from 6 957 in 2011 to 7 720
in 2012, the long term trend for detections of
facilitators of irregular migration has been
falling. In 2008 and 2009, there were more
than 9 000 detections.

* Center for the Study
of Democracy, Better
Management of EU borders
through Cooperation, 2011

According to some reports, this long-term
decline may in part be due to a widespread
shift towards the abuse of legal channels and
document fraud to mimic legal entry to the
EU, which results in facilitators being able to
operate remotely and inconspicuously rather
than accompanying migrants during high-risk
activities such as border-crossing.

In Romania, there was a significant increase in
the number of migrants hidden in the means
of transport, mainly because many migrants
who entered at the border with Serbia and
applied for asylum subsequently left the asylum centres and were then discovered hidden in trains exiting towards Hungary. Many
of them tried to board the trains going to
Hungary after the border checks had been
performed.

The total EU-level detections of facilitators
of irregular migration tend to be made up of
several disparate trends involving unrelated
nationalities detected in different Member
States. For example, despite a decline in detections compared to the year previously,
France reported the most detections of facilitators, whereas Spain ranked second at
EU level. Hungary reported a large increase,
mostly of Serbs and Hungarians detected
inland and at the border with Serbia. This
increase is most probably connected to facilitation of secondary movements of migrants,
after they have entered Greece illegally from
Turkey.

Another emerging trend in 2012 is the detections of secondary movement of migrants
hiding in trains from Thessaloniki (Greece)
to Linz (Austria).

Member States tend to detect more domestic facilitators than any other nationality; in
2012, all of the top three reporting countries
for this indicator reported their own citizens

35 of 80

Frontex · annual risk analysis 2013

as facilitators more frequently than any other
single nationality. Among the countries reporting the most facilitators this propensity
was strongest in Italy and Spain, where about
a third of all detected facilitators were of their
own nationals. In France, this proportion is
about a fifth of all detections.

Spain and Portugal to Ireland and the UK using forged passports from different Asian
countries. After several intercepted smuggling attempts, and the arrest of some of the
organisers, the network changed their modus
operandi and started smuggling the migrants
hidden in the trunks of cars loaded on lorries.

In 2012, there were several investigations that
led to a number of important arrests. In many
cases, the investigations revealed that facilitators, not only provide assistance to cross
the border illegally, but also facilitate the stay
of irregular migrants in Member States by
providing fraudulent documents.

As is true for other serious organised crimes,
facilitators of irregular migration make an
extensive use of the internet according to
Europol reports. It allows OCGs to get information about legislation, procedures, etc.,
and can be used for recruitment of migrants,
to transfer money and to engage in anonymous communication. In China, for example,
agencies use Chinese websites and newspapers to market immigration to specific
Member States as a way of gaining social benefits or the possibility to move freely within
Schengen. Diaspora communities in destination countries can be a facilitator for recruitment. In addition, some asylum centres
function as recruitment hubs, where OCGs
find a large potential customer base for the
onward smuggling route.

In Spain, an investigation launched in March
resulted in the arrest of ten facilitators who
had been smuggling migrants from Turkey to
Greece. Once inside the Schengen area, migrants were supplied with residence permits
through marriage or domestic partnership
with citizens. Apparently, this organisation was
also actively engaged in narcotics trafficking.
In Italy, there were several developments in
relation to migrant smuggling from Egypt
and through the Western Balkans. For example, the police dismantled a criminal organisation that operated for years between
Egypt and the Sicilian coastline. Also, a well
branched criminal organisation which operated between Turkey and Italy was dismantled during the reporting period. This group
used the Western Balkan route, aimed at the
illegal entry of Turkish citizens who crossed
the land border between Italy and Slovenia
hidden aboard vehicles and/or using false
documents.
A Chinese people-smuggling network, operating European-wide, was dismantled by
the French Police (OCRIEST) in June 2012,
with Europol’s support. Eleven suspects were
arrested. Another facilitator had previously
been arrested in the UK. The network smuggled Chinese irregular migrants from France,

According to Europol, facilitation of irregular immigration is usually nationality- or ethnicity-based and the OCGs are hierarchically
structured. The leader is responsible for the
coordination of the smuggling throughout a
certain territory, and has international contacts with other networks doing other parts
of the smuggling action, and with coordinators in other countries. The leader coordinates
drivers, guides, providers of accommodation
often assisted by ‘local agents’.
Local persons of the nationality of the transit
country retain their importance on the executive level of the facilitation network. They
are local guides to illegally cross the green
borders. For example on the Balkan routes,
the use of Serbian and Hungarian guides was
reported. They can be drivers for local distances or for transportation into the destina-

tion country, for example Afghan organisers
recruiting Romanian lorry drivers.

tigations, as well national social systems and
the ability of any state to effectively manage and protect its legitimate communities.
As modern documents require increasingly
sophisticated and expensive techniques to
produce quality forgeries, document fraudsters progressively need closer and stronger
links to organised crime groups, which also
increases their profits.

Leadership can also be based on family relationships. In some cases opportunistic individuals can also be involved in facilitation of
irregular migration.
Europol also indicates that there is no specific
link between the modus operandi and the nationality of the facilitator. For example, one
Albanian-speaking OCG may be involved in
clandestine entry, while another organise
marriages of convenience.

It is generally recognised that the abuse of
travel documents fall in four broad categories:
n	forgeries – previously authentic documents that have been tampered with;
n	counterfeits – entirely manufactured documents made to resemble originals;
n	fraudulently obtained documents – authentic documents that were issued based
on fraudulent applications or supporting
documents;
n	impostors – authentic documents being
used by an unauthorised user (look-alikes).

3.5. Document fraud
Document fraud is widely acknowledged by
the EU border-guard community to be a serious problem not only because it allows migrants in irregular or unlawful situations to
enter the territory of a Member State, and
potentially also to move freely within the
Schengen area, but also because it make it
possible for individuals to assume a bogus
identity and operated within the black market. This seriously affects internal security,
and undermines international criminal inves-

The abuse of EU passports is of particular concern because migrants using them
may be subject to less rigorous checks at
the external border, and because the document may be used to access social sys-

tems or be reused for other migrants to
attempt illegal entry. Another major issue relates to fraudulently obtained visas,
which raise particular challenges for firstline officers to detect, especially given linguistic differences and fact that migrants
are often not required to cross the external border of the same Member State that
issued the visa. Some of these issues will be
addressed by the Visa Information System
(VIS) which should be operational among
issuing authorities across eleven regions
by November 2013.
According to EDF-RAN data, in 2012 there
were nearly 8 000 detections of migrants
using fraudulent documents to illegally enter
the EU/Schengen area from third countries,
which is a substantial increase compared to
previous years. Much of this increase was
due to higher pressure at the external border in terms of migrants using, inter alia,
counterfeit stamps or forged passports to

The European Union Document-Fraud Risk Analysis
Network
Despite the recognised seriousness of document fraud, until
recently there was no regular or consolidated information
exchange among Member States and there were no overall
analyses of trends in the field of document fraud at EU level.
To address this information gap and following on from the
success of an earlier pilot study, the European Union Document-Fraud Risk Analysis Network (EDF-RAN) was formed
in early 2012 to serve as a platform for information exchange
among Member States.
Overseen by Frontex, during 2012 some 28 Member States/
Schengen Associated Countries met and exchanged information on several occasions, and instigated and maintained
a detailed and complex monthly data-exchange programme
covering all detections of document fraud at the external
borders and on all international flights. Data were exchanged detailing the migrant, the document and the
route taken – all at the level of individual events.

38 of 80

illegally enter Member States from third
countries.
However, at least some of the increase can
probably be attributed to a gradually increased focus on consistent and well-defined reporting within the framework of
the EDF-RAN.
In previous years, most detections were
made at the major EU airports, but in 2012
there were more detections at the external
land (56%) than at both the air (39%) and sea
borders (5%). The reason for the switch was
a massive increase in the number of Albanian nationals detected at their land border
with Greece, using counterfeit border-crossing stamps to fabricate travel histories and
extend periods of stay. This trend, involving
mostly circular migrants, would have begun
in 2011 once Albanians were granted visafree access to the Schengen area.
Albanians were also increasingly detected
travelling from the Schengen to the UK and,
to a lesser extent, to Ireland.
Away from the land border, detections
tended to be focused at the major international airports, with Fiumicino (FCO),
Lisbon (LIS), Madrid (MAD), Brussels (BRU)
and Frankfurt (FRA) detecting the most individuals on arrival. Each of the top airports
detected more passports than any other
document, mostly forgeries, but at Lisbon
more authentic passports (unknown nationalities) and at Frankfurt more counterfeit
passports (Syrians) were detected than any
other type of fraud. Among these passport
holders, most airports detected a wide variety of nationalities throughout 2012, with
particularly noticeable numbers of Bangladeshi migrants detected in Fiumicino, Syrians in Frankfurt, Fiumicino and Warsaw,
and Congolese (DMR) in Brussels.

Nationalities of document fraudsters
Albanians were the most commonly detected
nationality using document fraud to illegally
enter the EU/Schengen area from a third
country. The other top five nationalities were
Syrian (see section on Syrian migrants), Moroccan, Ukrainian and Nigerian.
Consistent with previous years, migrants from
Morocco were mostly detected in Spain, using
authentic Spanish ID cards to attempt entry
to Ceuta or Melilla. Elsewhere, more Moroccans were detected at the Italian than at the
Spanish air border, suggesting that Moroccans attempting entry at the air border prefer to target countries where border guards
may have less experience in controlling them
than Spanish border guards.
Ukrainians were detected in decreasing numbers also using counterfeit stamps attempting entry to Poland and, to a lesser extent,
Hungary and Slovakia.
Nigerians have been in the top five for detections of document fraud for several years
and in 2012 were slightly more detected than
in 2011. The most commonly abused documents by Nigerian nationals were authentic
and forged Nigerian passports and counterfeit French visas.
Embarkation points
More than two thirds of all detections on
entry at the air border from a third country
were of migrants with known places of embarkation. In 2012, Istanbul was used by document fraudsters attempting illegal entry to
the EU/Schengen area with the largest overall
number of detections, and with Syrians and
Iranians being the most common nationalities. The significance of this route is likely to
increase in 2013 while the Greek operation
Aspida is still active at the Greek land border with Turkey.

Other top embarkation points tended to
be most associated with migrants local to
each region. For example the second most
common embarkation point for document
fraudsters in 2012 was Lagos, where Nigerian
migrants dominated. Similarly Casablanca,
which ranked third, was where most Moroccans embarked and Tunis, which ranked
fourth, was mostly used by Tunisians.
Syrian migrants
In 2012, there was a very significant increase
in detections of Syrian nationals using document fraud to illegally enter the EU/Schengen
area from third countries, from below 100 detections in 2011 to nearly 500 in 2012. Moreover, the number of detections increases to
over 1 200 once detections on intra-Schengen flights (~500) and movement between
the Schengen area and the UK and are also
included. Hence, Syrian migrants represent a
significant and increasing risk of document
fraud to illegally enter and move within the
EU/Schengen area. They were most commonly detected on entry to German airports
on flights from Athens and Istanbul.
On entry to the EU/Schengen area from
third countries, Syrian migrants were most
commonly detected with counterfeit Turkish passports and ID cards, and stolen blank
German passports. In contrast, while travelling within the Schengen area, counterfeit Greek ID cards and stolen blank Greek
residence permits were most frequently
detected. Overall there were also many instances of authentic Syrian passports and
Bulgarian and Romanian documents. In each
case the issuing authority of these documents probably reflected place of embarkation and probably also access to facilitators
of the same nationality.
The EDF-ARA 2012 highlighted the increasing
trend of document fraud being used by migrants making secondary movements on in-

tra-Schengen flights from Greece, and during
the first half of 2012 this was particularly the
case for Syrian migrants. However, following
the start of the Greek operation Aspida in
August 2012, there was a noticeable decline
in the number of document fraudsters of all
nationalities including Syrians arriving on intra-Schengen flights from Athens. However, if
detections on exit from Athens are also taken
into account the decline of Syrians was less
dramatic. Subsequent to the operation Aspida, all nationalities were detected in much
lower frequencies because fewer migrants
were entering Greece from Turkey. This decline may also be partly explained by more
expensive flights during the summer period,
forcing many migrants to make secondary
movements via cheaper means than air travel.
Elsewhere in the region, there was a concurrent increase in the number of document
fraudsters of many nationalities particularly
Syrians arriving in Schengen airports on
flights from Istanbul, supporting the theory
that many migrants are waiting in Turkey
rather than crossing the border into Greece
or Bulgaria.

3.6. Refusals of entry
While most refusals of entry are reported
from the land and air borders, in line with

40 of 80

the distribution of passenger flows, the longterm trend is an increase at the land border and a decrease at the air borders. These
long-term trends are assumed to be linked
with increasing passenger flow at the land
border, but the lack of detailed data on regular passenger flow does not allow for detailed analysis.
There were large increases in refusals of entry at the Polish land borders with Belarus
(due to an increase in refusals of entry issued to Georgians, which peaked in October) and Ukraine. However, these increases
were offset by a decrease in refusals of entry issued at other border sections, like at
the land border between Greece and Albania, but also decreases reported at some airports, resulting in a stable total at EU level
compared to 2011 (115 305, -3%).
In 2012, the sharpest increase was the increase in refusals of entry of Georgian nationals at the Polish border with Belarus, most of
it (75%) during the second half of 2012. Between June and December 2012, the number
of refusals of entry issued to Georgians at the
Polish land border with Belarus was three
times as high as between January and June.
The vast majority were refused for Reason C
No valid visa. This was confirmed by JO Focal
Point reports in which the majority of Georgians were refused for not having a valid visa
or residence permit (C) or an alert had been
issued in the SIS or national database (H).
The phenomenon of increased numbers of refused Georgians is likely to lead to an increase
in Georgians illegally staying in other Member
States, in particular Sweden and Germany.
Nationalities
Despite increased numbers of Georgians
refused entry to Poland, the most common
nationality refused entry at a single border
section was Ukrainian nationals refused

entry at their land border with Poland.
Ukrainians, who ranked first for refusals
of entry at EU level, were refused entry
to Poland for a variety of reasons, particularly Reason C No valid visa, and Reason
E No justification.
The majority of Albanians continued to be
refused at the BCP Kakavia, one of the main
border-crossing points at the Greek–Albanian border. The main reported reasons for
refusal of entry were an alert issued in the SIS
or national database (H), false travel document (B) or not having appropriate documentation justifying the purpose and conditions
of stay (E).
At the air borders, Brazilians still rank first for
refusals of entry, but on a decreasing trend
with less then 3 000 refusals of entry in 2012,
compared to more than 10 000 in 2008.
The same decreasing trend is observed for
other Latin American nationalities, all of them
sharply decreasing between 2011 and 2012, like
nationals from Venezuela (836, -37%), Paraguay (595, -55%).
In the UK, US nationals represent a large
proportion of refusals of entry but they are
not linked to irregular migration. Indeed, US
passengers represent far more arrivals than
other passengers, and the refusals of entry
issued to them are mostly technical and not
assessed by the UK authorities as a threat
of irregular migration to the EU. This shows
the importance of analysing refusals of entry against passenger flows, as otherwise the
conclusions can be misleading.

3.7. Detections of illegal stay
In 2012, there were 344 928 detections of illegal stay in the EU, which represents a generally stable trend compared to the year before
and recent reporting periods. This is consistent with a stable but slightly declining longterm trend over the past five years (Fig. 16).

In 2008, there were 441 237 detections of illegal stay, or 28% more than in 2012.
In the following analysis of detections of illegal stay it has to be borne in mind that in
2012 the Netherlands, for technical reasons,
only reported detections on exit and not detections made inland, which in 2011 amounted
to about 6 000. Also in Sweden many asylum applicants were also reported as illegal
stayers, raising the total number of detections of illegal stay in Sweden.
While the number of detections of illegal stay
declined in many Member States, it increased
or remained unchanged in some. There are
multiple reasons for these developments, including indirect ones such as visa liberalisation and the economic crisis in the EU. Also
crucial in explaining the long-term decline
are factors such as effective legislation, policies and their implementation in the form
practical measures.
The declines since 2008, in terms of volume
and trends, have been the strongest in Spain
(-53%), France (-61%), Italy (-52%) and Portugal

(-67%). In contrast, Germany reported considerable increases between 2008 and 2012
(+62%). Consequently, it ranked first for detections of illegal stay.
The vast majority of illegal stayers were detected inland (278 438 detections, or 81% of
the total) and so are presumed to be long-

term overstayers as they were making no
­attempt to leave at the time of detection. The
next most common location for detections
of illegal stayers was those exiting at the air
(35 410 detections or 10% of the total) followed by the land borders (19 883 detections,
or 5%) whereby illegally staying migrants
were leaving the EU or the Schengen area.

and Algerians have been among the top five
since 2008, Pakistanis, ranking third in 2012,

According to the EMN Focussed Study on
the Misuse of the Right to Family Reunification released in June 2012, whilst the perception among policy makers, and the media in
particular, indicates that misuse of the right
to family reunification through marriages of
convenience or false declarations of parent-

hood may be a widespread phenomenon, the
evidence suggests that, while marriages of
convenience do occur, it is not yet possible
to fully quantify it across all Member States
in a comparable manner. Where misuse has
been detected, this seems to be primarily for
marriages of convenience rather than false
declarations of parenthood.
Member States face many challenges when
distinguishing a marriage of convenience from
a genuine marriage. Not only is this a sensitive matter in terms of respecting fundamental rights, and Member States are fully
committed to their obligations in this respect,
but such investigations tend to be very timeconsuming and resource-intensive with the
burden of proof most often placed on the
Member State authorities.
Students
Overall, at EU level, the extent of the abuse
of student visa is unknown. Gauging from the
responses by Member States, the phenomenon seem to vary widely among Member
States. The UK made changes to Tier 4 (student tier) of their Points-Based System to
tackle abuse, including by increasing the level
of English language proficiency and imposing
additional requirements on educational institutions. In contrast, twelve Member States
took steps in simplifying procedures for students to enter and stay on their territory as
this is seen as a way to import skilled and educated foreigners.

3.8. Asylum applications
In 2012, there were more applications for asylum in the EU since FRAN data collection began in early 2008 (note that data for France
and the Netherlands only include applications
made at the border). The number of claims
increased from 2011 to 2012 to reach 272 208
applications. Germany ranked first with a
quarter of all asylum applications in the EU.

Both the number of claims and the number of applicants increased by 7% between
2011 and 2012.
Considering the total of applications, while
Afghans still rank first, the most significant
trend was the increased applications submitted by Syrian nationals, which in 2012
increased to nearly 22 424 applications, compared to 8 180 applications in 2011. This represented the most major influx of asylum
seekers for many years. Of these asylum seekers two-thirds were reported by Sweden and
Germany.
Nevertheless, regarding the total of applicants, more than 32 000 asylum seekers from
Western Balkans (visa-exempt nationalities)
applied in the EU in 2012. Then Afghans with
27 630 applicants (-13% in comparison with
2011, 29 672) and Syrians, 22 424 applicants
(+172% in comparison with 2011, 8 180).
Syrian migrants have been reported to arrive
from Istanbul with Swedish genuine passports used as impostors, as well as some
forged EU passports and forged or stolen
blank Greek residence permits. However,
many Syrians also arrived from Istanbul with
Turkish Airlines in possession of genuine Syrian passports without any visas or permits.
The number of Russian applications also increased between 2011 and 2012, due to increases reported by Poland; 16 350 applicants
(+26% in comparison with 2011, 12 936). Most
of the applications of Russian nationals in Poland are believed to be connected with Russians of Chechen origins.
Since Frontex started to develop the Post
Visa-Liberalisation Monitoring Mechanism
(PVLMM) for the European Commission in
2011, following the introduction of a visafree regime for Western Balkan countries
(Serbia, the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia, Albania and Montenegro) in

43 of 80

Frontex · annual risk analysis 2013

2012, the number of asylum applications of
Western Balkan nationals in 2012 was the
largest recorded. In 2012, a total of 32 886
asylum applications were filed in the EU by
the Western Balkan visa-exempt nationalities. This represents an increase of 53%
compared to 2011.
Most asylum seekers from the Western Balkans continue to travel to the EU overland,
using regular bus connections. By and large,
entry into the EU occurs at the HungarianSerbian or Slovenian-Croatian border.

3.9. Returns
Return decisions issued

Type of return

In 2012, there were 269 949 third-country nationals subject to an obligation to leave the
EU as a result of an administrative or judicial
decision, which was a 17% increase compared
to 2011. However, much of this change was
due to new definitions applied to this indicator by Italy in early 2012. Not considering
data from Italy, the annual increase was of
2%. Nevertheless, the absolute total number
of migrants subject to return decisions is still
underestimated by this indicator, as data on
decisions were unavailable from France, the
Netherlands and Sweden, which countries
only reported effective returns and where it
is assumed that high numbers of decisions
were issued.

It is difficult to evaluate the overall costeffectiveness of return measures against
other practical measures taken to reduce
irregular migration. However, forced returns are recognised as being more costly
than voluntary return, although Member
States highlight the importance of return
flights (including those co-ordinated by
Frontex) in ensuring effective return, as
well as in acting as a deterrent effect for
future irregular migrants.*

Slightly more than half of the total reported
decisions at EU level were issued in just three
Member States: Greece, the UK and Italy. In
Greece, most decisions were taken for Paki-

44 of 80

Effective returns
In 2012, there was a steady trend of 159 490
third-country nationals effectively returned
to outside the EU. The UK was the Member
State conducting the largest number of returns, with steady trends of returned nationals from India and Pakistan. Although from
lower bases, some of the biggest increases
at the EU level compared to the year before included Serbian nationals (from 4 948
to 7 494, +51%).

Given the growing trend of the phenomenon
in the past two years, there are now discussions in the EU regarding the possible reintroduction of the visa regime. Frontex Post
Visa-Liberalisation Monitoring Mechanism
is an essential instrument supporting these
discussions.

stanis and Afghans. These decisions amount
to large numbers of requests to leave the
country within 30 days, most of which are
routinely ignored by migrants who instead
continue with their secondary movements
to other Member States. In the UK, most return decisions were taken for Indians and Pakistani, whereas in Belgium they were mostly
taken for North Africans (Algerians, Moroccans and Tunisians).

Within the number of effective returns to
third countries, about half were reported to
be on voluntary basis and half were forced
return. The UK and Poland reported the largest number of voluntary return, and Greece,
the UK and France accounted for nearly half
of the forced return. Most of the forced return concerned Albanians returned by Greece,
followed by Pakistanis.

Since 2010 in Norway, most people who
applied for assisted voluntary return have
been offered graded reintegration support. The amount offered in support is up
to NOK 20 000 (EUR 2 700). The only condition is that people apply for voluntary return before the deadline that has been set
for leaving Norway. Since 19 July 2012, families who have been refused asylum in Norway are offered NOK 10 000 (EUR 1 350)
per child in addition to the NOK 20 000
per adult if they return voluntarily to their
country of origin. This support is meant to
encourage families who have been illegal
in Norway for many years to apply for voluntary return.
The Norwegian authorities have closely
monitored the system in order to detect
possible misuse and to monitor the possible pull-factor effect. Earlier this year, Norway experienced a sudden increase in the
number of asylum seekers from Belarus.
Many applied for assisted voluntary return
suspiciously shortly after they were registered as asylum seekers.
In March, it was decided that IOM returnees from Belarus were no longer entitled to
receive subsistence allowance or reintegration grant. Since June, Georgians have also
been temporarily excluded from the financial support scheme.
In Greece, several measures taken by the
Greek authorities to counter irregular migration (Xenios Zeus and Aspida), the continuously worsening labour demand prompted
many to opt for voluntary return. In 2012, a
total of 6 324 people — most of whom were
from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh and
Iraq, — left Greece with the IOM program,
and a further 800 were repatriated by a
scheme funded by Norway. Among them,
about 360 took part in resettlement programmes that included special assistance
for opening businesses, or training, which

were provided as an incentive to help them

3.10. Other illegal activities
This section is an overview of cross-border
crime affecting the work of border guards
at the external borders of the EU. The analysis is structured around the following issues: smuggling of illicit drugs, trafficking
in human beings, terrorist threats, smuggling of weapons, stolen vehicles (on exit),
smuggling of excise goods (cigarettes and
oil products).
3.10.1. Smuggling of illicit drugs
Seizures in 2012 demonstrate a continued
demand for conventional drugs in the EU,
but they also show a trend towards an increasingly diversified market of new, mainly
synthetic drugs. This development poses additional challenges to authorities along the
EU external borders, particularly requiring improved training and means of identification.

Around 85% of the globally consumed heroin
is produced from Afghan opium. Large parts
of this substance are trafficked through Iran,
Turkey, and South East Europe towards Central and Western Europe, along the so-called
Western Balkan route. Europol reports that
large quantities of heroin continue to be imported via Turkey using freight or passenger
vehicles, and Turkish OCGs have established
themselves in key EU countries to maintain
control further down the supply chain. In
2012, border guards together with custom
officers detected a total amount of 86 kg
of heroin through Frontex Joint Operations
in Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, and Slovenia.
Most seizures were related to single travellers who concealed smaller amounts on their
bodies or in cavities of their cars. Other detections, however, showed the reappearance
of larger scale heroin shipments along the
Balkan route – a phenomenon that seemed
to decrease during 2011. On 9 August, 21.8 kg
of heroin were found in the tank of a Bosnian lorry during JO Focal Point Land. In November, Frontex border guards searched the
car of a Bulgarian citizen and found 10.8 kg
of heroin packed in 21 bags under the rear
seats of the vehicle.
In its largest single heroin seizure ever, the
Austrian customs authority detected 130 kg
of heroin packed in 230 parcels that were
hidden in hollow cavities of a Bulgarian cooling van. Only an x-ray device for lorries and
test drillings were able to confirm the initial suspicion of the participating officers.
The perpetrators smuggled the load along
the Balkan route into Bulgaria and planned
to transport it to one of the Benelux countries.* Also Greece is a major entry door for
heroin to the EU.
Although future developments are hard to
predict, a decrease in seizures, availability
and market prices show that the heroin prob-

lem is currently subsiding. However, studies
claim that heroin is likely to be replaced by
other substances such as synthetic opioids,
methamphetamine, cathinones and benzodiazepines. UNODC also estimates that due
to the existing a customs union between the
Russian Federation, Kazakhstan and Belarus,
the deliveries of opiate products to Europe
will see a displacement from the Balkan route
to the Northern route, which leads through
Central Asia.**
Heroin is not the only illicit substance systematically smuggled along the Balkan route. In
2012, 657 kg of Marijuana was seized through
Frontex Joint Operations at the borders to
Croatia, Albania, Serbia and Turkey. The largest related shipment was detected in October 2012 at the Hungarian BCP Kelebia,
when a citizen of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia attempted to smuggle
492 kg of Marijuana concealed under a double wall of his empty van. Cannabis from Albania to mainly Greece, Italy, and the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is reported
again in large amounts, after Albanian law
enforcement managed to destroy production capacities in many rural areas. While in
2011, around 3.7 tonnes of cannabis herb have
been seized by Albanian authorities, the number more than doubled in 2012.

The Bulgarian BCP Kapitan Andreevo to Turkey is a particularly vulnerable border-crossing point along the Balkan route with a very
large amount of regular traffic. Law-enforcement activities at Kapitan Andreevo regained
momentum in May 2012, after Bulgarian antiorganised crime police uncovered and disrupted a corruption scheme involving dozens
of customs officers. Frontex JO Focal Points
Land assisted in revealing numerous attempts
of drug contraband at this BCP. In one case,
Frontex officers detected 33 kg of heroin in
the tank of a van driven by a Serbian citizen,
who intended to transport the illicit load from
Turkey to Serbia.

points at the ferry ports of Algeciras, Tarifa
and Ceuta of Spain. The number of drug detections during this operation rose by 6.6%
to 209, thereby confiscating almost 5 tonnes
of hashish and 35 kg of Cocaine. 260 persons
were involved in the smuggling attempts, 61%
of the perpetrators were of Moroccan and
26% of Spanish nationality. In many cases, the
smugglers attached the drugs to their bodies, swallowed them, or hid them in hollow
cavities of their cars and lorries.

The Western Mediterranean route is extensively utilised for the smuggling of cannabis
products from Morocco. Moreover, organised crime groups smuggle cocaine from
Latin America through West Africa, subsequently using boats and airplanes on their
way towards Europe. Europol reports that
the Iberian Peninsula, in particular Spain, is
considered to be the main entry point for cocaine arriving in Europe.
Most of the cannabis resin consumed in
Europe has traditionally been produced in
Morocco and smuggled through Spain into
the EU. Simultaneously, the Africa-Frontex
Intelligence Community Joint Report 2012
assumes that a growing amount of cannabis from West Africa is smuggled out of the
region and may reach Europe through the
Mediterranean Sea. Additionally, Afghanistan’s growing cannabis production and
indoor cultivation within the EU is increasingly challenging Morocco’s dominance as
a supplier.*
Like in 2011, JO Minerva 2012 has been particularly successful in revealing these illicit
shipments. The operational areas of this operation were the maritime border-crossing

The Spanish National Police seized
more than 11 tonnes of hashish
hidden in fuel tanks
In December, Spanish authorities disbanded a criminal organisation that
controlled the entire trafficking chain
from production to packaging, transport from Morocco to Spain, storage,
and the redistribution across Europe –
mainly to France, Belgium, the UK and
the Netherlands. The group conducted
periodic drug shipments on trucks using
ferries into the EU, whereby the marijuana was hidden in double floors of
truck fuel tanks. National Police agents
have seized more than 11 tonnes of hashish and arrested 35 people in what has
been one of the biggest operations
against the trafficking of hashish in
the interior of the Iberian peninsula.

Drug Report, 2012

The amount of hashish seized during JO EPN
Indalo increased by 147% between 2011 and
2012. This operation took place along the
Spanish coast between Granada and Malaga and led to the arrest of 84 persons who
attempted to ship 30 tonnes of hashish into
the EU. In many cases smugglers used rubber boats or fast jet skis to reach the Spanish coast. The operation revealed that the
facilitation of irregular migration and the
smuggling of drugs from Morocco are geographically and organisationally separated.
For the second year in a row the JO EPN Indalo has been used as platform for EU inter-agency cooperation between Frontex,
CeCLAD-M, EFCA and Europol. At least five
drug-related incidents were reported during JO Hera, which took place between July
and December between the Canary Islands
and Morocco. The operation led to the confiscation of 3 146 kg of hashish and the arrest of 13 smugglers.
Cocaine trafficking from South America
to Europe yields higher profits than to the
United States and remains therefore strong.
This trend was exemplified by a shipment of
3.2 tonnes of cocaine aboard the Bulgarian
vessel Sveti Nikolay, which Spanish law-enforcement authorities intercepted around
80 km off Cadiz on its way to Galicia in northwestern Spain. 21 Bulgarian and 6 Colombian
citizens were arrested in connection with the
shipment. Cocaine trafficking towards the
EU is strongly diversified, whereas Spain is a
main entry point and distribution centre for
cocaine from Latin America. According to Europol, large amounts of cocaine are furthermore dispatched from Latin America through
container vessels to the European ports of
Antwerp and Rotterdam.

Drugs smuggled across the Mediterranean
Sea to enter the EU from the Balkans
Incidents in 2012 showed drug shipments that
were trafficked across the Mediterranean Sea
with the purpose to enter the EU through
Bulgaria. In July 2012, Bulgarian law-enforcement authorities seized 12 tonnes of hashish
worth around EUR 360 million in a warehouse in the village of Mirovyane near Sofia.
National authorities claimed that the cannabis was brought from Morocco, unloaded in
the Black Sea and transported to the mainland by fishermen. The amount seized exceeded the detection of 4 tonnes of hashish
destined for Belgium on a Danube ferry near
Vidin few days before. The two cases were
claimed to be connected. The Black Sea Borders are currently not covered by any Frontex Joint Operation.
In May 2012, Bulgarian customs officers found
67 kg of cocaine hidden in a combine harvester that was transported on successive
ships from Argentina to the Black Sea city
of Varna and from there to the Danube city
of Ruse. The destination for the illicit substance was planned to be the Netherlands.

© JO EPN Indalo 2012

Figure 21. Inflatable boat smuggling hashish
from Morocco to Spain

According to Europol, substantial seizures
of cocaine, mostly in containers, have been
made in Black Sea ports and in the Balkans,
suggesting the development of these regions
to important entry points for cocaine. Cocaine is also increasingly directed towards
Croatian ports.
New synthetic drugs and their precursors
smuggled on different routes mainly
from Asia
The success of future anti-drug strategies will
increasingly depend on the capacities to effectively identify a wide range of substances.
The EU Early Warning System reports the
detection of around one new toxic stimulant per week, with a clearly rising tendency.
All new drugs notified between January and
September 2012 have been synthetic, with
the largest groups being the synthetic cathinones (e.g. mephedrone, MDPV), which show
similar effects as cocaine, and the synthetic
cannabinoids.* Most of the synthetic cathinones are produced in China, India, Pakistan
and other Asian countries, whereas amphetamine-type stimulants are manufactured in
Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Japan, Lao PDR,
Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Republic of
Korea and Thailand.**
In some cases, the traditional flow of illicit
drugs into the EU may be reversed by in-

creased production of new ‘designer drugs’
in Central European countries, as well as of
ecstasy and amphetamines in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Poland. Also in the Czech
Republic, the police-led disruption of 400
methamphetamine labs in 2012 revealed a
clear export orientation of the illicit business.
Moreover, the number of products containing multiple psychoactive substances is on
the rise, as also in the case of many ‘Legal
Highs’, which are produced through chemical precursors mainly coming from China. The
term is insofar misleading, as many of these
drugs contain both controlled and uncontrolled substances. ‘Legal highs’ are popular
among young consumers, as they are easily available through retail outlets and a rising number of internet stores. The impact of
these drugs on the health of their consumers
is enormous: 43 people died in the UK after
taking licit methcathinones in 2010, compared to 5 deaths in 2009.
As the example of Hungary shows, the new
trend towards ‘legal highs’ and a diversification of synthetic drugs significantly changed
the characteristics of the drug supply lines.
Many new substances are produced domestically. While many of their online stores serve
an international market, the precursors for
the new synthetic drugs are ordered from
China.***

3.10.2. Trafficking in human beings
In June, the European Commission adopted
a new strategy for the years 2012–2016 for
the eradication of Trafficking in Human Beings. It announces key priorities in the fight
against that crime, including the identification of victims, preventive measures,
an increased prosecution of the perpetrators, enhanced coordination and cooperation among key actors, and the raising of
public awareness. According to Europol,
however, a large obstacle in the combat

to border guards before planes arrive in the
UK. A similar cooperation between the globalised travel industry and national border
authorities on a European level could exponentially increase its outreach.

against trafficking in human beings is the
lack of harmonised and sufficient data on
the phenomenon, which leads to a significant intelligence gap. Assessments of
national, international, and non-governmental organisations are frequently based
on incomplete data and estimates. In its
Communication on measuring crime in
the EU, the European Commission therefore adopted an Action Plan for 2011–2015
to collect comparable and reliable data,
based on a small number of indicators.*
The detection of persons trafficked for the
purpose of sexual exploitation or forced labour represents a major challenge for border authorities. Victims have to be identified
as such although many of themselves not
aware about their fate when they arrive in a
transit or destination country. 2012 saw the
further development of new ways to prevent human trafficking. The key for a better
recognition is the delivery of advance information to border guards, which would substantially supplement the few seconds they
normally possess for the identification of a
potential victim among countless other passengers. Some airlines in the UK started to
train cabin crews to identify potential perpetrators and victims of human trafficking already aboard the aircraft. A hotline has been
established to communicate potential cases

Research and law enforcement revelations
related to human trafficking showed various nuances of the phenomenon lately. Interviews with Nigerian victims in the UK
conducted by the Institute for Public Policy
Research suggest that most victims did not
actively decide to take employment in the
UK for an expectedly better life, but were
compelled to leave their country by a parent or close family member. The study also
refutes the idea that Nigerian human trafficking is run by organised crime groups involved in drug smuggling and other crimes.
Most of the trafficking was indeed informally
arranged by the closest environment or the
family of the victims.
In contrast, other Member States highlight the systematic division of work and
high organisational level reached by Nigerian nationals involved in the trafficking of
human beings, who operate nationally and
across borders, applying a combination of
modern managerial skills, traditional cultural values and religious beliefs. In these
cases, Nigerian criminal networks conducting this crime should be seen as an
aggregation of criminal groups with different tasks and specialisations, including
the recruitment of the victims, the counterfeit of documents, the transportation
to the country of destination, the exploitation of the victims and the laundering of
profits. Some of these functional elements
are also connected to other criminal activities. Migrants crossing the border illegally
near the coast of Sicily, Calabria and Puglia,
for example, are turned into trafficking victims by seizing their passport and forcing
them to settle their fictive ‘debt’ through
sexual or labour exploitation.

Some disruptions of Chinese criminal organisations involved in large-scale human trafficking activities, money laundering, and the
smuggling of drugs and counterfeit products
were reported in Spain and Italy.
The recently published UNODC Global Report
on Trafficking in Human Beings 2012 described
a particularly unsettling trend. According
to its data collection and analysis, carried
out in cooperation with national authorities,
the number of trafficked children slightly increased in Europe, accounting for around 16%
the total during the reporting period. Many
of these children were forced to beg or commit petty crimes, others were trafficked for
forced marriages, or forced participation in
pornography. A frequent modus operandi related to trafficking of children has been seen
by JO Indalo, when ‘anchor children’ were accompanied by Nigerian women on their way
to Spain, who claimed to be their mothers.
The parenthood, however, could be excluded
by DNA test. The objective was to be granted
with legal documentation that would allow
free movement within the EU and to sponsor ‘family reunification’ with a ‘father’ still
abroad. The women where forced into prostitution upon arrival in Spain, whereas a male
migrant waiting in Morocco would claim to
be the father and therefore be granted with
the legal documents to follow.
While trafficking in human beings for labour
exploitation is globally on the rise, this purpose accounted for about 29% of all victims
in Western and Central Europe, which is below the international average. The stagnant
European economy that followed the financial crisis boosted a low-cost labour market
for mainly seasonal agricultural employment,
which shows visible elements of coercion and
deception. The International Labour Organisation estimates that 1.5 million people are
victims of forced labour in the developed economies, including cases resulting from prior
trafficking. In 2007, the calculated opportu-

nity costs of coercion in terms of lost earnings amounted to an estimated EUR 1.5 billion
in the developed economies and EUR 15 billion globally.*

The Cost of Coercion, 2009

3.10.3. Terrorism
The terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001,
the August 2006 transatlantic aircraft plot in
the UK and the 2009 Christmas Day Bombing attempt gradually shifted aviation-related
security measures towards more stringency
and comprehensiveness, but at the same time
complicated the life of bona fide passengers
and increased expenses for travel operators.
A future strategy to further enhance security
measures on commercial flights will have to
emphasise on advance risk assessments and
both the inter-agency and international exchange of information.
In 2012, the main EU decision-making bodies were negotiating a Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the
Council on the use of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data for the prevention, detection,
investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime. The aim of the directive would be to set up an EU system for
the collection and use of PNR data, covering all flights across EU external borders. It
would include information related to names,
the date and the itinerary of the flight, and
the means of payment used, among other
things. Air carriers would transfer the data
before departure of the flight to the law-enforcement authorities of the Member State
it operates the flight from or to. The system
allows border authorities to analyse the data
and to compare it with existing files, as for example related to terrorism. The data would be
kept for 30 days, after which Member States
would need to make it anonymous.
Recent cases show that efficient analytical
capabilities in the identification of false documents are an essential tool of border author-

ities for the prevention of terrorist attacks.
The person that committed a suicide attack at
the US embassy in Ankara on 1 February 2013
had crossed the EU external border from the
Greek islands to Turkey with a false ID card.
3.10.4. Smuggling of small weapons
The rather sporadic information received
through Frontex Joint Operations and Member State authorities on trafficking in small
arms across the EU external borders does not
give a comprehensive picture on the overall
situation and leave a substantial knowledge
gap. However, individual incidents suggest
certain geographically related threats and
vulnerabilities.
During JO Focal Points Land 2012, small fire
arms, ammunition, and gun powder have
been seized in 10 incidents, most of them at
the borders to Croatia and Serbia.
Analysts from the Member States expect a continued flow of illicit small arms
from the Western Balkan countries, where
a large number of weapons are stored in
private households. The influx of weapons
from the Western Balkans to Central and
Western Europe may increase after the expected EU accession of Croatia and the shifting of the EU customs border to the long
and mountainous area between Croatia and
Bosnia-Herzegovina.
3.10.5. Stolen vehicles
According to Europol, the main destinations
for stolen vehicles are: the Russian Federation, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Belarus, Ukraine,
Pakistan and North Africa. This strongly influences the main routes for stolen vehicles and
the composition of the OCGs, mostly made
up of nationals from these regions.
The most concerned border section for the
export of stolen vehicles in 2012 was ­between

52 of 80

Poland and Ukraine. In the course of JO Focal Points Land, 197 stolen cars, vans, lorries,
trailers and motorbikes were identified e.g.
through their vehicle identification numbers
(VIN), with Volkswagen and Mercedes being
the most popular brands.
The second most important destination region for cars and other machinery stolen from
mostly Germany, France and Italy were the
Western Balkan countries. In the context of
JO Focal Points Land, 83 cars were detected
along the Slovenian-Croatian border. The
export of 49 stolen vehicles was prevented
at the border between Hungary and Serbia.
The most popular targets for vehicle thefts
destined for the Western Balkan countries
were Volkswagen, BMW, and Audi.
A development away from the theft of luxury
models towards a preference for cars of the
medium and lower classes can be also seen
in France, where in 2012 compact cars were
among the models that were most stolen
and frequently disassembled into spare parts.
The prevalence for average-looking vehicles
with standard colours definitely complicate
the risk profiling efforts of border authorities.
JO Focal Points Land reported 41 stolen cars,
lorries and motorbikes identified upon their
attempted exit from Bulgaria and Greece
to Turkey. Car thieves on the way to Turkey
had exceptional preferences with an emphasis on luxury and sports cars, including
the brands BMW (15) and Mercedes (8), Porsche (3), and Lamborghini (2). While most of
the drivers were EU nationals or Turkish citizens, some were from countries as far away
as Iran, Egypt, Iraq, and Syria.
Another frequent destination of cars stolen
in EU countries was Northern Africa: Frontex officers in cooperation with national authorities detected 42 stolen vehicles on their
way to Morocco, of which 12 were identified at BCP Algeciras. Almost 1.2 million cars

external borders flourished in 2012 in face of
rising excise taxes on tobacco in many EU
countries. In general, cigarette smuggling is
perceived as a low risk business, since in many
countries it is treated as a misdemeanour –
compared to the tough criminal sanctions
imposed on drug traffickers.

Figure 25. Smuggling of 800 litres of petrol
products detected at the Polish-Ukrainian
border in December 2012

The largest smuggling operation that was
uncovered in 2012 revealed a tunnel built
between Uzhgorod in Ukraine and Vysne
Nemecke in Slovakia. The smugglers used advanced mining technology to build the 700
metres long construction and equipped it
with its own narrow-gauge train.

On a daily basis, cigarettes are smuggled
on a small scale – by travellers or migrant
workers returning home to the EU, or by persons residing in the border regions. Criminal
organisations make use of both ‘ant techniques’ and large-scale operations including hundreds of thousands of cigarettes. In
2012, most detections of contraband cigarettes were made along the borders to the
Russian Federation, Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova and Turkey.

A very frequent modus operandi detected during JO Focal Points Land was to leave unattended amounts of tobacco in trains, from
where they are picked up upon arrival at their
destination. Larger amounts of cigarettes
have been hidden in hollow cavities of cars
and double walls or floors of lorries. In several
cases, cigarettes were smuggled across the
river Uh, which originates in Ukraine and for a
short section draws the border with Slovakia.

In July, the cheapest pack of 20 cigarettes
cost 41 cents in the Russian Federation, while
Lithuanian citizens paid an amount five times
and Finnish citizens ten times as high. Specifically, the situation around the Kaliningrad
region was made worse by the fact that several cigarette factories within the exclave
solely produce for export purposes. The difficult economic situation in Kaliningrad and
its neighbouring countries shapes an environment that additionally encourages cigarette smuggling.

While cigarettes where increasingly smuggled from Morocco to Spain and detected
through JO Minerva and Indalo, also the Eastern Mediterranean showed to be an emerging
hub for trafficked tobacco. One of the largest detections made in the context a Frontex
Joint Operation consisted in the detection of
around 53 760 000 Egyptian-produced cigarettes on the vessel ‘Noah’ under Moldovan
flag. The ship attracted the attention of the
authorities in December 2012 close to Chania on the Greek island of Crete.

Trafficking of petroleum products is mainly
reported at the eastern European borders
with the Russian Federation, Belarus and
Ukraine, as well as with the Balkan countries.
Petrol price differentials between Member
States and third countries made the smug-

gling of petrol a profitable enterprise along
these border sections. Anecdotal evidence
suggests that petrol smuggling occurs frequently and often involves individual smugglers transporting smaller quantities for their
own consumption or sale to acquaintances.

4. Environmental scan
Economic situation in Europe remains
difficult
The EU continues to deal with a difficult economic crisis, which bears heavily on labour
demand and employment performance in
the EU. The differences between Member
States in economic activity and labour market dynamics have increased significantly
throughout 2012. According to the European Commission, the already high unemployment rate is likely to rise further in 2013,
both in the EU and the Euro area. More importantly, the situation in more vulnerable
Member States will progressively affect the
remainder of the EU.
The EU economy is expected to grow at a
subdued rate of 0.5% in 2013. However, the
European Commission warns that this outlook is still marked by high uncertainty and
subject to substantial downside risks.

Home Affairs in the next MFF
According to the European Commission’s
proposal, the number of funds in home affairs during the new Multi-annual Financial
Framework (period 2014–2020) will be reduced from the current four to only two: the
Asylum and Migration Fund (AMF) and the
Internal Security Fund (ISF). While the number of the funds will be smaller, the available founding should increase by almost 40%
compared to the total budget for the previous period 2007–2013.
Both funds will have an external dimension
ensuring continuity of financing, starting in
the EU and continuing in third countries.
There will also be a common regulatory
framework for both funds.
The new arrangement should allow for a better management, either shared or centralised, of available resources. Member States
will be entitled to basic amounts and could

be eligible for variable amounts based on the
results of mid-term review and risk assessment (inter alia) from Frontex.
Implementation of Visa Information
System (VIS)
The first phase of VIS implementation started
already in October 2011 when consulates of
all Member States (excluding the UK and Ireland) and Schengen Associated Countries in
Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco
and Tunisia began inserting biometric data of
visa applicants into the VIS. Sweden was the
first Member State with a registered transaction while Germany was the first to issue
a visa with fingerprints.
By the end of 2011, the VIS had successfully
processed almost 300 000 visa applications,
of which roughly 33 500 visas were refused.
A large majority of all fingerprints were submitted by only four Member States: France,
Germany, Italy and Spain. The new system
already detect almost 500 cases when the
same person applied in more than one consular post (potential visa shopping).
By the end of 2012, the VIS was extended
to cover two additional regions; the Middle
East and the Gulf (Israel, Jordan, Lebanon
and Syria, Afghanistan, Bahrain, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United
Arab Emirates and Yemen). The current plan
is to extend the use of VIS to cover the whole
globe by the end of 2013.
The VIS should be considered as integral part
of a future EU systems that will use advanced
technology to strengthen controls and capac-

ity to monitor entries to the EU. Under current plans it will be joined in coming years by
an Entry-Exit System (EES) and Registered
Traveller Programme as part of the ‘smart
borders package’.
Schengen Information System II (SIS II)
goes live in 2013
SIS II will have a number of new features compared to the current Schengen Information
System. These include the insertion of biometric data into the system; interlinking of
alerts on people and/or objects; and possible
interoperability with other databases such as
the Visa Information System (VIS).
Following the testing of the national and central systems’ components, the focus of activity in the first half of 2012 was on intensive
testing of the central system and its increasing interaction with the national systems.
The preparations for the final stages of the
project, namely the actual migration of SIS I
data, also advanced considerably during 2012.
According to the European Commission, all
challenges encountered during these final
testing phases of the project were addressed
successfully, thanks to the over-riding cooperative approach between Member States and
the European Commission, allowing the SIS II
project to go live in the first quarter of 2013.
SIS II will allow end users to have access to
the extended functionality of SIS II – access to copies of the European Arrest Warrant, links between alerts, new categories
of alert, access to fingerprints and photographs of the subjects of alerts, enhanced

Member States’ national D-type visa
policies show significant variation

** European Migration
Network Synthesis Report,
Visa Policy as Migration
Channel, 2012

An in-depth study** of Member States’ use of
long-stay (D-type) visas as a tool to manage
migration, both in terms of facilitating legal
migration and preventing irregular migration, revealed that a ‘mosaic of visa and residence permit requirements exists in several
Member States’.
Member States differ regarding:
n 
The range of migratory purposes for which
visas are issued (e.g. migration for study,
employment, family reunification or humanitarian purposes);
n T
he target groups (e.g. third-country origin,
skills level, etc.) to which visas are issued;
n 
The ‘function of the visa’ in terms of managing migration (e.g. visa as a travel/entry
permit; visa as a temporary residence title, before a permanent one is granted in
the Member State);
n 
The validity of the visas; and
n 
The procedures for applying, examining,
extending, and withdrawing these visas.
The study also showed that in only three
Member States (France, Slovenia and the
UK) there is a strong link between national
visa policy and migration management. Visa
policy and practice of these Member States
are fully supporting respective national migration strategies.

Road map for visa liberalisation with
Kosovo*
Kosovo remains the only region in the Western Balkans that is excluded from the visafree travel arrangements. At the end of 2011,
the Council reaffirmed that Kosovo would
benefit from the perspective of eventual visa
liberalisation once all conditions are met and
without prejudice to Member States’ position on status.
Against this background, and taking into
account the Council’s requirements expressed in various Council conclusions, as
well as the result of numerous expert missions and meetings, the European Commission launched visa dialogue with Kosovo
during January 2012.
The road map for visa liberalisation with Kosovo was presented by the European Commission in June 2012. In this framework, Kosovo
was requested first to adopt or amend the
legislation in line with the EU acquis and as
set out in the road map. Kosovo is also expected to fully implement the new legislation and all other measures specified in the
road map document.
EU-Russian Federation visa
liberalisation Common Steps
During 2012, the visa dialogue between the EU
and the Russian Federation entered into implementation phase of the Common Steps which
were agreed at the end of 2011. Field missions
were implemented both by the EU and the
Russian Federation. While the timetable leading to actual negotiations and to possible visa
liberalisation is not known, a preliminary analysis on the impact shows that visa liberalisation would be a major institutional change at
the eastern land borders of the EU.
The operational environment would change
significantly with the expected strong

58 of 80

growth of traffic at the EU-Russian Federation land borders. There is a lot of potential
in foreign travel in the Russian Federation
in general with large population base near
the border.
The growth of traffic in recent years at the
Finnish-Russian land border (12 million in 2012,
over +60% since 2009), partly due to use of
the visa facilitation agreement, as well as
recent figures from the Polish-Russian land
border (+71.6% in 2012) suggest that the potential for the growth of traffic in the conditions of visa liberalisation is very large.
Possible use of EURODAC data for lawenforcement purposes
The European Commission’s proposal to
recast the EURODAC Regulation will not
change the fundamental way in which EURODAC operates for the purpose of comparing the fingerprints of asylum seekers and
certain other categories of migrants in order to facilitate the Dublin Regulation. The
recast includes an extension to the scope
of the Regulation in order to allow law-enforcement authorities in Member States as
well as Europol to compare latent fingerprints from crime scenes with EURODAC fingerprint data for the purpose of preventing,
detecting and investigating serious crimes
and terrorism.
The Agency for the Operational Management of Large‑Scale IT Systems in the Area of
Freedom, Security and Justice (EU-LISA) was
established as anticipated and took up its responsibilities on 1 December 2012. The handover of the operational management of the
VIS is ongoing with a view to providing the
full EU-LISA command on VIS management
in the second quarter of 2013. The technical
activities supporting the operational management have been carried out smoothly;
with in particular the signature of the Main-

tenance in Working Conditions contract with
an IT consortium at the end of 2012.
Update on EU readmission agreements
Readmission agreement with Pakistan is in
force since 1 December 2010. The level of implementation is quite weak. The first Joint Readmission Committee under the agreement
was convened in June 2012. The next meeting should be held in February 2013.
The agreement with Turkey was initiated
on 21 June 2012. The agreement is ready to
be signed.
The agreement with Cape Verde was initiated on 24 April 2012. The agreement should
be ready to be signed early 2013 once the
Council grants its authorisation for the formal signature on behalf of the EU.
The negotiations on readmission agreement
with Morocco are still stalled since 2010 and
await the finalisation of the Mobility Partnership with Morocco. The negotiations with
Belarus were not launched yet.
Readmission negotiations with Armenia
have been completed (initialling of the Readmission Agreement took place on 18 October 2012) – now awaiting approval from the
Council to sign the Agreement. Readmission
negotiations with Azerbaijan are on the way
– a fourth round is scheduled to take place
in Brussels on 12 March 2013.
EUROSUR Directive – recent
developments
Frontex has run the EUROSUR pilot project since 2010. All EUROSUR developments
have been conducted in close collaboration
with the European Commission and Member
States. The EUROSUR Network has been in
use since December 2011 and since March 2012
the Network has been used to exchange op-

erational information. During 2012 the Network was expanded from the original six
Member States (Spain, France, Italy, Slovakia, Poland and Finland) to 18 (Portugal, Spain,
France, Italy, Malta, Slovenia, Greece, Cyprus, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia,
Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Finland
and Norway).

National Coordination Centres (NCCs) have
been established in all these countries. The
EUROSUR Directive is expected to enter into
force as of 1st October 2013. By this date, the
main pieces of the EUROSUR framework as
well as the so called EUROSUR ‘basic services’ should be available.

5. Outlook
Based on the descriptions of the situation in
2012 and a review of the main factors, be it
economic, legal or technical, that can contribute one way or another to irregular migration to the EU, this chapter reviews the
possible evolution of the situation along the
external border of the EU in the short-term.
However, past experiences demonstrate that
there are a large number of unforeseeable
events and factors that can have a profound
and unpredictable impact on the situation
at the border.

5.1. Croatia joining the EU in
July 2013
Accession negotiations with Croatia were
closed in June 2011. After the European Commission’s favourable opinion, the European
Parliament’s assent and the Council decision on the admission of Croatia, the Accession Treaty was signed on 9 December 2011.
Croatia has ratified the Accession Treaty
and will become a Member of the EU on 1
July 2013, subject to the Accession Treaty
being ratified by all Members States. As
an acceding country, Croatia has an active
observer status during the interim period
before accession.
With Croatia joining the EU, the external land
border of Member States of the EU will shift
from the land border between Slovenia and
Croatia (695 km) and Hungary and Croatia
(355 km) to the land border between Croatia
and Serbia (325 km), Croatia and Bosnia-Her-

zegovina (1 001 km) and Croatia and Montenegro (22 km), resulting in a net increase
of 327 km. Combined, the borders between
Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia and
Montenegro total approximately 1 377 km.
Therefore, Croatia will be the Member State
with the longest external land border, slightly
longer than Finland (1 340 km) and Greece
(1 248 km).
The border section between Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina (1 001 km) will be the second longest land border section, after the
land border between Finland and the Russian
Federation (1 340 km). This long border section crosses very diverse terrain, from small
mountain ranges to urban areas.
Among all Croatian land border sections, the
border between Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina will be one of the busiest EU land border
sections in terms of regular traffic.
The main change in passenger flow across
the external land borders of the EU will be
the exclusion of the large flow of passengers across the Slovenian-Croatian border.
This is currently the land border section with
the heaviest passenger traffic through BCPs,
with 25 million entries in 2012.
The fact that Croatia is not yet joining the
Schengen area and that border control will
continue to operate between Croatia and Slovenia, is expected to have moderate impact
on the main routes used by irregular migrants.

5.2. Illegal border-crossing
expected to remain concentrated
at the southern and southeastern borders of the EU
Based on the location of the main countries
of origin for irregular migration to the EU for
the past five years, the border areas that are
most likely to deal with illegal border-crossing
remain the Southern Mediterranean coast,
and the borders with Turkey. Migrants living
in or having relatively easy/facilitated access
to Turkey and/or North Africa will continue
to be overrepresented in the flow of irregular migrants to the EU.

* European Commission’s
Multi-Annual Thematic
Programme, Cooperation
with Third Countries in
the areas of Migration and
Asylum, 2011–2013

The internet and social networking sites will
contribute to the rapid exploitation of vulnerabilities along the external border of the EU,
allowing relatively cheap and non-sophisticated illegal border-crossing. It is expected
that illegal border-crossing along the green
border, either at the land border or the sea
border, will continue to significantly mobilise
border-control authorities in the EU.

5.3. Increase in passenger flows,
in particular at the air border
Regular passenger flows across the external border will increase significantly in the
coming years due to rising global mobility, visa liberalisation processes and local
border traffic agreements along the eastern borders. Consistent with the increasing flow of passengers, a growing number
of registered traveller programmes (RTP)

62 of 80

should further ensure the smooth flow of
bona fide passengers.
An important strategy for efficiently processing increasing passenger flows is the development and deployment of Automated Border
Checks. Such systems are being installed progressively in several Member States’ airports.
Automated Border Checks uses the electronic
information in the passport like facial or iris
recognition technology to perform checks
normally undertaken manually at the BCP.

5.4. Increase in mixed
migratory flows: asylum
seekers and irregular migrants
The EU continues to receive a high number of refugees and asylum seekers. On the
other hand, still a substantial number of economic migrants appear to use the asylum
procedure to try entering or staying on the
territory of the EU.* The mixed nature of migratory flows contributes to placing the national asylum systems under pressure and
the credibility of the asylum procedures under strain. Therefore, while Member States
are continuing their asylum system reforms,
they increasingly call for the development at
EU level of migration and refugee solutions
in the regions of origin and transit.
The proposal for the so-called visa safeguard
clause (amending Council Regulation (EC) No
539/2001), that was originally presented by
the European Commission in May 2011 in response to growing abuse of asylum from the
Western Balkans, is still not adopted.

6. Conclusions
The assessment of risks along the EU external borders shows that despite a sharp reduction in detections between 2011 and 2012, the
risks associated with illegal border-crossing
along the land and sea external borders remain among the highest, in particular in the
southern part of the border of the EU. This
is due to the current uncertainties related to
the sustainability of the efforts at the GreekTurkish land border, combined with a continued volatile situation in traditional departing
countries in Northern Africa and the Middle
East. Resurgence of situations at the southern border during which thousands of persons
illegally cross the border in a few weeks or
months remains likely. Past experiences also
show that these crises take their toll on human lives, are very difficult to predict and to
quell without coordinated responses.
Most risks associated with document fraud
were assessed as high. Indeed, document
fraudsters not only undermine border security
but also the internal security of the EU. These
risks are also common to nearly all Member
States, as they are associated with passenger flow and border checks, a specific expertise of border-control authorities.

Most risks associated with abuse of legal
channels are often assessed as high due to
their high and widespread occurrence. Although no reliable measurements exist, they
probably represent the easiest and most common modus operandi for persons staying illegally in the EU.
Clandestine entry, mostly people hiding in
vehicles, is assessed as moderate. However,
uncertainties remain on the extent on the
phenomenon, as there is no reliable measurement in place.
Based on currently available information, the
risks associated with cross-border criminality are assessed as moderate, including the
risks of trafficking in human beings, terrorism, smuggling of illicit drugs and exit of stolen vehicles.
Border-control authorities may increase
prevention by early detections only through
strengthened border management resulting
in increased coordination with other law-enforcement bodies.

Indicator 5 – Applications for international protection (asylum applications):
The number of third-country nationals having submitted an application for international protection or having been included in
such an application (e.g. as a family member) during the reference month (see Article 4.1 of Regulation (EC) No 862/2007 of
11 July 2007). Each applicant for international protection must be recorded only once within the same reference month. This
indicator concerns applications submitted to Member State authorities at the external border as well as applications submitted
inside the territory. It is the number of new applications which have been submitted exclusively during the reporting month (in
contrast to the total number of applications under consideration in a country at a certain time). It should include all applications
for international protection such as for refugee status, subsidiary or temporary protection, etc. This indicator should not include
EU or Schengen Associated Country (SAC) nationals.

Indicator 6 – Persons using false travel documents for entering the territory illegally:
The number of persons who were detected by Member State authorities during border checks at BCPs who attempted
to use false travel documents, false visas or false permissions to stay for the purpose of entering the territory. All cases
of falsifications (forged, counterfeit, substitution of photo or name, fantasy documents, etc.) have to be included. The
category concerns only those persons who used false passports, identity cards, residence or work permits, visas, etc., i.e.
types of documents of which genuine versions would be valid for entering. Cases in which other types of documents have
been used, such as false driving licences, false boarding passes or false supporting documents should not be included in
this category. This indicator should include third-country nationals as well as EU and Schengen Associated Country (SAC)
nationals.

Notes on FRAN data sources and
methods
The term Member States refers to FRAN
Member States, which includes the 27 Member States and the three Schengen Associated
Countries (Iceland, Norway and Switzerland).
For the data concerning detections at the external borders of the EU, some of the border
types are not applicable to all FRAN Member States. This pertains to data on all FRAN
indicators since the data are provided disaggregated by border type. The definitions
of detections at land borders are therefore
not applicable (excluding borders with nonSchengen principalities) for Belgium, the
Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany,
Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the
Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland
and the UK. For Cyprus, the land border refers to the Green Line demarcation with the
area where the Government of the Republic of Cyprus does not exercise effective control. For sea borders, the definitions are not
applicable for land-locked Member States
including Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Luxembourg, Slovakia and Switzerland.
In addition, data on detections of illegal border-crossing at land, air and sea BCPs (1B) are
not available for Iceland, Ireland and Spain,
and in Greece these detections are included
in the data for indicator 1A. Data for Norway only include detections of illegal border-crossing at land and sea BCPs (1B), not
between BCPs (1A).
In Italy, detections of illegal border-crossing
at sea BCPs are only reported for intra-EU
border-crossing from Greece. Data on detections of illegal border-crossing between
sea BCPs (1A) are not available for Ireland.
Data on apprehension (FRAN Indicator 2) of
facilitators is not available for Ireland. For Italy, the data are not disaggregated by border
type, but are reported as total apprehen-

sions (not specified). Data for Italy and Norway also include the facilitation of illegal stay
and work. For Romania, the data include
land Intra-EU detections on exit at the border with Hungary.
For the data concerning detections of illegal stay (FRAN Indicator 3), data on detections on exit are not available for Denmark,
Ireland, Italy, Spain and the UK. For Greece,
only detections of illegal stayers with false
documents are reported at the air border as
detections of illegal stay on exit.
Data on refusals of entry (FRAN Indicator 4)
at the external EU borders are not disaggregated by reason of refusal for Ireland and
the UK. Refusals of entry at the Spanish land
borders at Ceuta and Melilla (without the issuance of a refusal form) are reported separately and are not included in the presented
FRAN data.
The data on applications for international
protection (FRAN Indicator 5) are not disaggregated by place of application (type of
border on entry or inland applications) for
Austria, the Czech Republic and Slovenia. For
these countries, only the total number of applications is reported. For France, only asylum applications at the external borders are
reported, not inland applications. For Switzerland, requests for asylum at the Swiss
embassies abroad are also reported and considered as inland applications in the FRAN
data. For the UK, data reported for applications at air BCPs also include applications at
sea BCPs.
For Ireland, data on persons using false documents are only available from February 2011
(FRAN Indicator 6). In Sweden, the data on
false document use are not presented since
the reported detections do not distinguish between apprehensions of persons using false
documents at the external border and those
apprehended inland.
