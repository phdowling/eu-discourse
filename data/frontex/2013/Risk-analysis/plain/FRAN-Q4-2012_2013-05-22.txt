Frontex official publications fall into four main categories: risk analysis, training, operations
and research, each marked with a distinct graphic identifier. Risk analysis publications bear a
triangular symbol formed by an arrow drawing a triangle, with a dot at the centre. Metaphorically, the arrow represents the cyclical nature of risk analysis processes and its orientation
towards an appropriate operational response. The triangle is a symbol of ideal proportions
and knowledge, reflecting the pursuit of factual exactness, truth and exhaustive analysis.
The dot at the centre represents the intelligence factor and the focal point where information from diverse sources converges to be processed, systematised and shared as analytical
products. Thus, Frontex risk analysis is meant to be at the centre and to form a reliable basis for its operational activities.

Executive summary
During the final quarter of 2012, several FRAN
indicators varied radically compared to previous reporting periods. For example, there
were just 13 613 detections of illegal bordercrossing at the EU level, which is the lowest
ever recorded figure for any quarter since
data collection began in early 2008. In contrast, both clandestine entries and asylum
applications were at by far their highest levels since data collection began and, although
falling slightly compared with the previous
quarter, refusals of entry at the external border remained at one of the highest levels
since 2009.
The reason for fewer detections of illegal
border-crossing were the combined deterrent effects of the Greek operation Aspida,
which involved the deployment of large numbers of additional police officers to the Greek
land border with Turkey, and also the Greek
operation Xenios Zeus that targeted irregular migrants in Athens and other urban areas.
The widespread effects of these operations
are demonstrable with analyses of FRAN indicators. For example, detections of illegal border-crossing at the Greek land border with
Turkey fell from being an undisputed hotspot for illegal entries during the first half of
2012, to almost negligible levels during the final quarter of the year. Detections of all nationalities fell to almost the same degree,
which suggests that the effect was due to
decreased vulnerability at the border, rather
than changes to a push factor.
Following the Greek operation Xenios Zeus,
the number of effective returns performed by
Greece increased dramatically in Q4 2012, particularly of nationalities previously associated
with detections of illegal border-crossing.

The well-publicised operations were also followed by increased detections away from the
operational areas, which probably represent
displacement effects away from the Greek
land border with Turkey. These included increased detections of:
1.	illegal border-crossing at the Greek sea border with Turkey;
2.	illegal border-crossing at the Bulgarian land
border with Turkey;
3.	document fraudsters on flights from Istanbul, rather than Athens.
Despite the effect of these operations in reducing detections at the Greek land border
with Turkey, there is currently no evidence
to suggest that the absolute flow of irregular migrants arriving to the region has decreased in any way, although it’s reasonable
to assume that this may occur in the mediumterm. Instead, reports suggest that migrants
are currently waiting in Turkey, with some
nationalities starting to integrate with Turkish society, while others consider alternative
migration options. Moreover, most routes of
secondary movements from Greece did not
show signs of significant decline. These included detections of:
1.	Afghans and Pakistanis as illegal bordercrossers and clandestine entries across the
Western Balkan region;
2.	Afghans and Pakistanis arriving in Calabria
and Apulia on pleasure boats from Greece;
3.	fraudulent document-users on intra-Schengen flights from Greece (declining trend).
Elsewhere of the Eastern Mediterranean,
there were more detections of illegal border-crossing on the main Central Mediterranean route from North Africa than during
any other quarter of 2012, mostly Eritreans,
Somalis and Gambians departing from Libya,

5 of 62

Frontex · FRAN Quarterly · q4 2012

followed by Tunisians and Egyptians departing from their own countries. These journeys
are increasingly dangerous because many arrived on very flimsy and often unseaworthy
vessels due to the reported reduced availability of sturdy boats in Libya. Also significant to
the safety of the migrants is the poor treatment they received from facilitators, who
leave them uniformed and poorly equipped.
Across a wide range of indicators, irregular migration of Syrian migrants increased
more than any other nationality during the
final quarter of 2012, hence reflecting their
desperate plight. For example, detections of
Syrians illegally crossing the external border doubled to 1 200 in Q4 2012, mostly in
Greece and, to a lesser extent, in Bulgaria,
where they were also increasingly subject to
decisions to leave. Also at the external border, Syrians were increasingly detected using
fraudulent documents, such that they were
ranked top among all nationalities, mostly departing from Istanbul. One result of the large
flow of Syrian migrants across the border
was a massive influx of Syrian asylum applications, which increased threefold to nearly
9 000, mostly in final destination countries
such as Sweden and Germany. In fact 11% of
all asylum applications in Q4 2012 were submitted by Syrians, amounting to more applications submitted by a single nationality in
any given quarter since data collection began for this indicator.
With an overwhelming 31% of all applications
submitted in the EU/Schengen area and following nearly a 43% increase compared to
the previous quarter, Germany received by
far the most applications for international
protection and more than reported by any
Member State in a single quarter since data
collection began in early 2008.

Of all nationalities migrants from Afghanistan continued to represent the largest proportion of the threat of irregular migration
to the EU in Q4 2012. For instance, Afghans
ranked first among nationalities for illegal
border-crossing and illegal stay both mostly
in Greece, clandestine entries at BCPs mostly
in Slovenia. As well as these indicators of irregular migration, migrants from Afghanistan
also ranked second for asylum applications
mostly in Germany.
The use of fraudulent documents continued
to increase during the last few months of
2012. This was particularly the case for Albanian migrants who were the nationality
most frequently detected using fraudulent
documents at the external border. Specifically, they were using counterfeit bordercrossing stamps to fabricate travel history
and extend periods of stay. In this case they
were nearly exclusively detected on entry at
the Greek-Albanian land border. Albanians
were also the nationality most commonly detected with fraudulent documents between
the Schengen area and the UK sometimes via
Ireland. In this case they were detected on
flights arriving in the UK but also while attempting to board flights leaving Italy and
other Schengen states.
Refusals of entry were at an exceptionally
high level in Q4 2012, with about 60% of refusals being from the land border and most
of the remainder being from the sea border.
As is usually the case, Poland refused the
most migrants. The two most common refusal phenomena were Ukrainian nationals
refused entry at the Polish land border with
Ukraine, followed by Georgians refused entry at the Polish land border with Belarus.
Ranked third was Albanians refused entry at
the Greek land border with Albania. In total
these three phenomena accounted for nearly
a third of all refusals of entry at the EU level.

1. Introduction
FRAN Quarterly reports are prepared by the
Frontex Risk Analysis Unit (RAU) and provide
a regular overview of irregular migration at
the EU external borders, based on the irregular-migration data exchanged among Member State border-control authorities within
the cooperative framework of the Frontex
Risk Analysis Network (FRAN) and its subsidiary, the European Union Document-Fraud
Risk Analysis Network (EDF-RAN).
The main purpose of the FRAN Quarterlies
is to provide:
n	feedback to the FRAN community in the
context of information exchange;
n	a periodic update to the situational picture of irregular migration at the EU level;
and
n	material for constructive discussion on reporting protocols and related trends and
patterns.
This report is intended to simultaneously
serve two objectives: first, to provide a clear
summary of the situation at the external border of the EU, and second, to serve as an archive for future reference and comparative
analyses. Consistent with standard archival
techniques, some information is repeated
among sections to serve as context.

Harmonising complex, multi-source migration
data among Frontex and Member States is an
ongoing process. Therefore some of the more
detailed data and trends in this report should
be interpreted with caution and, where possible, cross-referenced with information from
other sources. The statistics should be understood in the context of the different levels of
passenger flows passing through different
border sections, the activities undertaken by
Member State border-control authorities to
secure different border sections and widespread variation in reporting and data-collection practices.
FRAN Members and Member State risk analysis experts and border-control authorities are
considered the primary customers of these
reports. In addition to the discussions taking
place during FRAN meetings, Member State
experts are invited and actively encouraged
to examine and comment upon the data and
analyses presented here. Despite all efforts
of RAU and Member State experts involved
in data exchange and analyses, it is conceivable that minor errors will occur in these reports due to very challenging timelines, and
the growing volume and complexity of data
and other information exchanged within the
FRAN community.

2. Methodology
This, the 18th issue of the FRAN Quarterly
is a comparative analysis of FRAN data collected between October and December 2012
and exchanged between 30 Member State
border-control authorities within the framework of the FRAN. The release of this report
coincides with a wide range of other Frontex risk analysis products including the Annual Risk Analysis (ARA) and the European
Union Document-Fraud Annual Risk Analysis
(EDF-ARA). For this reason the Q4 reports
are shorter and less detailed than at other
times of year, and do not include the chapter on third-country monitoring.
The report presents the results of statistical
analysis of quarterly variations in eight irregular-migration indicators and one asylum indicator, aggregated at the level of the event.
Bi-monthly analytical reports exchanged by
Member States were also used for interpretative purposes and to provide qualitative information, as were other available sources of
information such as Frontex Joint Operations.

Monthly data on the following indicators were exchanged
among the FRAN community:
1A detections of illegal border-crossing between BCPs
1B detections of illegal border-crossing at BCPs
2 detections of suspected facilitators
3 detections of illegal stay
4 refusals of entry
5 asylum applications
6 document fraud (EDF-RAN)
7A return decisions for illegally staying third-country nationals
7B	effective returns of illegally staying third-country nationals
FRAN data used in the tables and charts are as of 12 February 2013

8 of 62

Precise definitions of Indicators 1 to 6, aimed
at harmonising the data exchanged at EU
level, were presented in the annexes of the
Q1 and Q2 reports in 2009 and so are not
repeated here.
During the June 2010 FRAN Meeting, a proposal for a harmonised definition of the
return indicator was outlined and several
questions were presented in order to motivate discussion among FRAN Members in
view of establishing the regular collection
of monthly return data by Frontex. Subsequently, an online survey of FRAN Members
was conducted to gather information and
further motivate discussion to fine-tune the
proposal for the indicator. The 11th FRAN report (Q1 2011) was the first to include analysis
of Indicators 7A and 7B, and the definitions
of these indicators are included in an annex
to that report. Data collection commenced
in January 2011.
The FRAN data-exchange has been in place
since September 2007. Data are exchanged
through the ICONet Internet platform, an
interest group of the European Commission’s CIRCA server. Member State monthly
data are based on a country template prepared by the Frontex Risk Analysis Unit. The
deadline for submitting data for each month
is the 25th day of the subsequent month,
with the exception of the end of year data,
which are requested by 15 January each year.
For this 18th issue of the FRAN Quarterly,
the target for Member States to upload the
monthly data was thus 15 January 2013. In
principle, data submitted subsequent to this
date will be reflected in the next FRAN Quarterly, except in cases where clarification is
needed in order to proceed with comprehensive analysis.

Following the closure of the CIREFI working group in April 2010, most of its mandates
and, of particular relevance, the exchange of
data were transferred to the FRAN. Fortunately, most CIREFI indicators already overlapped with the monthly data exchange of
FRAN members. The exception was the indicator on returns, which was added as part of
the regular data exchange within the FRAN
at the beginning of 2011.
In January 2012 the European Union Document-Fraud Risk Analysis Network
(EDF-RAN) was formed as a specialist forum to oversee the exchange and analyses
of detections of document fraud to illegally
cross the external borders, and on all international flights. Data were backdated and
joined with exchanged in a pilot phase.
The EDF-RAN data are checked for inconsistencies and corrections are made to reported
totals to bring them in line with reported
breakdowns. Corrections are also made to
any three-letter nationality codes not present
in the reference ISO list of nationality codes.*
External borders refer to the borders between Member States and third countries.
The borders between the Schengen Associated Countries (Norway, Iceland and
Switzerland) and third countries are also
considered as external borders. The borders
between the Schengen Associated Countries
and Schengen Member States are considered as internal borders. For the indicators
on detections of facilitators, illegal stay and
asylum, statistics are also reported for detections at the land borders between the
Schengen Member States and Schengen candidates (Bulgaria, Romania) or non-Schengen
Member States (the UK, Ireland), so that a
total for EU Member States and the Schengen Associated Countries as a whole can
be presented. It was not possible to make
this distinction for air and sea borders because Member States do not habitually differentiate between extra-EU and intra-EU
air and sea connections but tend to aggregate data for all arrivals.

When data are examined at the level of thirdcountry nationalities, a large percentage
usually falls under the category ‘Other (not
specified)’ or ‘Unknown’. It is expected that
the percentage reported under these categories will decrease with time as Member
States improve the quality and speed of their
identification, data collection and reporting
practices. Nationalities are often reported as
‘Unknown’ if an individual’s nationality cannot
be established before reports are submitted.
This issue of the FRAN Quarterly also includes
main findings of Frontex-coordinated Joint Operations active for at least a portion of Q4 2012.
Namely, for sea borders they were JO Poseidon Sea 2012, JO Focal Points Sea 2012, JO Indalo 2012, JO Aeneas 2012, JO Hermes 2012, JO
Hera 2012; for land borders – JO Poseidon Land
2012, JO Focal Points Land 2012; and for the air
border – JO Focal Points Air 2012.
Both primary data sources, such as interviews
with irregular migrants, and secondary data
sources, such as reports of intelligence analysts, daily reports of deployed officers and
analytical products (weekly and bi-weekly
analytical reports for each abovementioned
operation), were used to provide an exhaustive overview of the situation at the external
borders of the EU. Additionally, open-source
data were researched as background information for the present analysis.

4. Situational picture in Q4 2012
n	During Q4 2012 several FRAN indicators
varied radically compared to previous reporting periods.
n	There were 13 613 detections of illegal border-crossing at the EU level, which is the
lowest ever recorded figure since data collection began in early 2008.
n	Asylum applications were at by far their
highest level since data collection began
in early 2008, with Syrians ranking first
among nationalities, followed by Afghans.
n	In Q4 2012 more Syrian migrants submitted
claims for asylum than any other nationality in a single quarter since data collection began in 2009.
n	Refusals of entry at the external border
fell slightly compared with the previous
quarter, but remained at one of the highest levels since the peak of 2009, mostly
involving Ukrainians and Georgians refused entry to Poland, and Albanians refused entry to Greece.
n	Detections of clandestine entry at BCPs
continued to rise, once more reaching the
highest level since data collection for this
indicator began in 2009.
n	Greek operational activity at the Greek
land border with Turkey continued
throughout the reporting period, causing three weak displacement effects:
–	Illegal border-crossing at the Turkish
sea border with Greece; in the Eastern Mediterranean region there were
more detections at the sea than at the
land border for the first time since late
2009, mostly of Afghans and Syrians;
–	Illegal border-crossing at the land border with Bulgaria, mostly Palestinians
and Syrians;
–	
D ocument fraudsters increasingly
on flights from Istanbul rather than
Athens.

12 of 62

n	Despite fewer detections at the Greek land
border with Turkey, there is no evidence
to suggest that absolute flow of irregular
migrants arriving in the region decreased.
Instead, migrants were probably waiting
in Turkey and considering other options.
n	Most routes of secondary movements
from Greece did not show signs of significant decline. These included:
–	Afghans and Pakistanis detected for illegal border-crossing and clandestine entry across the Western Balkans. In Q4
2012, Serbia detected more cases of illegal border-crossing than any EU Member State;
–	Afghans and Pakistanis arriving in
Calabria and Apulia on pleasure boats
from Greece;
–	use of fraudulent documents on intraSchengen flights from Greece (declining trend).
n	In Q4 2012, Afghans ranked first among nationalities for illegal border-crossing, clandestine entry at BCPs and illegal stay, and
ranked second for asylum applications.
n	Compared to the same period in 2011, most
indicators increased significantly for Syrian
nationals across a wide range of Member
States reflecting their desperate plight.
These included:
–	
illegal border-crossing doubled in
Greece and also increased in Bulgaria;
–	asylum applications increased threefold
to nearly 9 000, mostly in final destination countries such as Sweden and
Germany;
–	illegal stay increased nearly threefold,
in Sweden (asylum seekers) and Greece;
–	number of migrants that were subject
to decisions to leave increased nearly
threefold, in Greece and Bulgaria (illegal border-crossers);

–	use of fraudulent documents – increased throughout 2012, now ranking top among nationalities, mostly
departing from Istanbul.
n	There were more detections of illegal border-crossing on the main Central Mediterranean route from North Africa than
during the pre-Arab Spring peak of 2011,
mostly involving Eritreans, Somalis and
Gambians departing from Libya, followed
by Tunisians departing from their own
countries.

4.1. Detections of illegal
border-crossing
Overall in Q4 2012 there were 13 613 detections of illegal border-crossing at the EU
level, which was the lowest figure since
data collection began in early 2008. The low
number of detections compared to other
quarters was due to vastly increased operational activity at the Greek land border
with Turkey, where in recent years the majority of migrants were detected (operation
Aspida, see next section). Reduced detections were also in part due to the overlapping effects of the end of the Arab Spring
in its initial countries (Egypt, Libya, Tunisia)
and far fewer detections of Albanian circular migrants detected illegally crossing the
land border into Greece.
For the first time since 2010 there were more
detections of illegal border-crossing at the external sea border (59%) than at the land border, which reflects the increasing importance
of the Central Mediterranean route, and increased detections in the Aegean Sea in response to Greek operational activity at the
land border with Turkey. Of the top five reporting border sections, two were in Greece.
The border sections reporting the most detections in Q4 2012 were:
1.	the Italian Pelagic Islands (Lampedusa),
where there were increased arrivals of
Eritreans and Somalis;

2.	the Greek Aegean Sea, to where Afghans
and Syrians were increasingly displaced
from the Greek land border with Turkey;
3.	the Greek land border with Albania with
a significant trend of Albanian circular migrants, now ranking second at the EU level;
4.	the Spanish land border with Morocco,
where there was a steady trend of unknown nationalities (probably sub-Saharans) and Algerians;
5.	the Bulgarian land border with Turkey, to
where Palestinians and Syrians were increasingly displaced from the Greek land
border with Turkey.
4.1.1. Greek operations Aspida and
Xenios Zeus
On 30 July 2012, the Hellenic Police Headquarters announced the temporary deployment of 1 881 additional police officers and
technical equipment to the Evros region for
a planned period of two months of the operation Aspida (Greek for ‘Shield’). The operation was extremely successful in reducing
the flow of irregular migrants across the
border (see FRAN Quarterly Q3 2012) and so
was first extended until 2 January 2013 and
subsequently until March 2013. At the time
of writing, this operation is still active and,
in combination with JOs Poseidon Land and
Sea 2013, which were concurrently active
during the reporting period, is having very
significant effects on detections of irregular
migration across the Eastern Mediterranean
region and beyond.
Specifically, the well-publicised enhanced
surveillance and patrolling activities at the
Greek-Turkish land border, as well as an
extension of the detention period to up to
one year, resulted in a drastic drop in the
number of apprehended irregular migrants

Immediately after the deployment of the operation Aspida detections of illegal bordercrossing at Turkey’s sea border with Greece
and land border with Bulgaria both began
to increase, indicating weak displacement
effects from the operational area. Furthermore, according to EDF-RAN data, there was
also an increase in detections of migrants
using fraudulent documents on flights from
Istanbul, where many migrants are apparently waiting for the conclusion of the operation Aspida.
In order to cope with the new situation the
Bulgarian authorities initiated a specialised
police operation including the reinforcement
of manpower and the deployment of technical assets. Regular bilateral joint meetings for
the prevention and resolving of border incidents are taking place under the signed agreement between Bulgaria and Turkey. At this
moment, the Turkish authorities only accept
the readmission of Turkish citizens and documented Syrians.
In turn, the operation Xenios Zeus is focused
on detecting migrants in land in urban areas around Athens. In Q3 2012 this operation

did not have any detectable effects within
the scope of the FRAN indicators, but in the
current reporting period there was a rise in
the number of effective returns performed
by Greece.
4.1.2. EU summaries
While useful for summary purposes, EU-level
figures conceal considerable variation within
and among Member States, nationalities and
the major irregular-migration routes. For example, in contrast to the overall decline, in
Q4 2012 detections of illegal border-crossing significantly increased at a wide range of
border sections. Hence, the overall decrease
was driven by far fewer detections just at the
Greek land border with Turkey.
More detections were reported by Italy than
any other Member State, and more were reported from the Italian Pelagic Islands than
any other border section. Somalis continued
to arrive in Lampedusa in increasing numbers,
but this development was overshadowed by
a massive increase in the number of Eritreans arriving in Lampedusa and Malta from
October onwards.

Figure 2.Despite fewer detections of illegal border-crossing in Q4 2012 than during any other
quarter since data collection began in 2008, detections at the sea border were actually at
the highest level for over a year

Figure 2 shows the evolution of the FRAN
Indicator 1A – detections of illegal bordercrossing and the proportion of detections between the land and sea borders of the EU per
quarter since the beginning of 2010. The final
quarter of each year is usually influenced by
weather conditions less favourable for both
approaching and illegally crossing the external border of the EU. Correspondingly, poor
conditions for illegal border-crossing also render it more difficult to detect such attempts.
The combination of these two effects means
that the final quarter of each year has usually been associated with fewer detections
than during the summer months.
In Q4 2012 detections were particularly low
compared to other quarters of 2012 and also
compared to previous fourth quarters. The
former comparison is explained by the deterrent effect of the Greek operation Aspida,
while the longer-term decline illustrated by
the horizontal lines in Figure 2 (yearly average) is more to do with the absence in 2012 of
two disparate but overlapping phenomena:
1.	In 2010, nearly a third of all detections
were of Albanian circular migrants illegally
entering Greece. This flow was reduced by
85% in 2011 and 2012 since Albanians were
granted visa-free access to the Schengen
area;
2.	In 2011 there was a temporary surge of
illegal border-crossing in response to the
Arab Spring uprising in several North African countries.
Consistent with the majority of reporting
periods both before and after the 2011 Arab
Spring, at the EU level the migrants most
commonly detected illegally crossing the external border were from Afghanistan (1 969);
however, following a massive decrease at
their most common entry point, this was the
lowest figure for this nationality since early
2011. More than half of all Afghans were detected illegally entering Greece from Turkey,
while much of the remainder were detected

making secondary movements either across
the land border into Hungary or across the
Ioanian Sea to southern Italy. Albanians,
who ranked second at the EU level, were
also mostly detected in Greece but at their
own land border and still in much reduced
numbers since they gained visa-free status
in late 2010. Migrants from Eritrea, ranked
third following steep increases at the end of
the year, were mostly detected arriving in
Lampedusa and Malta on boats from Libya.
Other nationalities in the top five were migrants from Syria, who were detected in
lower numbers at the Greek land border with
Turkey, where they were increasingly common prior to the Greek operation Aspida, and
migrants from Somalia, who continued to
arrive in Lampedusa in significant numbers.
The 13 613 detections of illegal border-crossing
in Q4 2012 were the result of combined detections in 15 Member States, many of which experienced differing trends. Figure 3 (overleaf)
illustrates the number of detections of illegal
border-crossing among ten Member States
during the fourth quarters of both 2011 and
2012 (size of circles), and also the degree of
change between the two reporting periods
(slopes). In the current reporting period Italy
reported the most detections of illegal border-crossing, closely followed by Greece. Together these two Member States accounted
for over 60% of all detections in the EU.
In Q4 2012, most (nine) Member States reported increased detections of illegal bordercrossing compared to the same period of the
previous year, albeit from relatively low bases
(Fig. 3). For example, detections in Malta rose
sevenfold, from Q4 2011 to Q4 2012, mostly
due to increased detections of Eritreans, who
also played a major role in doubling the number of detections in Italy compared to a year
previously. A large percentage increase was
also reported by Bulgaria, particularly at the
land border, to where Palestinians and Syr-

ians were displaced by operational activity in Greece.
In contrast to increases in most Member
States, just five reported reduced detections:
Greece, Spain, Romania, Hungary and Lithuania. Spain reported significant reductions
but these were mostly in line with seasonal
expectations. However, it was the 81% reduction in Greece that drove the overall decline
in illegal border-crossing, as Greece tends to
report the most illegal border-crossers and
was subject to by far the biggest reduction in
detections in terms of both percentage and
absolute change.
Apart from analysing the changes in terms of
Member State distributions, it is also informative to consider these trends by nationality
of migrants. Figure 4 illustrates the number
of detections of illegal border-crossing of the
top ten nationalities during the fourth quarters of 2011 and 2012 (size of circles) and the
degree of change between these reporting
periods (slopes).
Despite an over 73% reduction compared with
Q4 2011, at 1 969 detections, migrants from
Afghanistan still ranked first among nationalities, followed by circular migrants from Albania (Fig. 4).
Despite recent decreases associated with the
operation Aspida, migrants from Syria ranked
third at the EU level, representing a major issue during the second half of 2012. There were
twice as many detections in Q4 2012 compared with a year previously but this vastly
understates the flow of Syrians towards the
EU in response to the civil war in Syria. For
instance, there was more than a sixfold increase between the third quarters of 2011 and
2012, and Syrians were also increasingly detected among a range of other indicators of
irregular migration such as illegal stay, document fraud and being subject to decisions
to leave the EU.

During the final quarter of 2012, the nationality with the fastest growing number of detections of illegal border-crossing in terms
of absolute increase was Eritreans: up almost threefold from 352 in Q4 2011 to nearly
1 300 in the current reporting period. Detections of migrants from Mali increased more
sharply but from a lower base: from 37 to 379
over the same period. In both cases, these
migrants were almost exclusively detected
in Lampedusa having left on small fishing
boats from Libya.
As regards the distribution of nationalities
among key border sections in Q4 2012, detections of illegal border-crossing at the EU
level were no longer dominated by detections in Greece, with more detections and a
wider range of nationalities reported by Italy. For the first time since 2010, detections
in Greece more commonly involved Albanian circular migrants detected at the Greek
land border with Albania than any other nationality. Also commonly detected in Greece
were Afghans and, to a lesser extent, Syrians, both at the sea border with Turkey. The
detections of Eritreans and Somalis in Italy
surged compared to Q4 2011.
Not all of these detections represent initial
entries to the EU at the external borders, as
they sometimes capture secondary movements of migrants that had previously entered Greece. For instance in Apulia and,
to a lesser extent, in Calabria, Pakistanis
and Afghans were detected after having
crossed the Ionian Sea on pleasure boats
from Greece, and Afghans were also detected crossing the Hungarian land border
from Serbia.

4.2. Routes
For more detailed analyses detections of illegal border-crossing are frequently classified
into major irregular migration routes, relating to regions of detection rather than linear

routes taken. As illustrated in Figure 5, during
the final quarter of 2012 detections of illegal
border-crossing on the three main irregular
migration routes converged to very similar
levels with only 2 000 detections separating the three main routes.

countries of origin such as Tunisia or Egypt,
whereas other migrants, typically from subSaharan countries depart from countries in
which facilitation is available and affordable
and where detection by national authorities
is thought to be low. Currently, Libya fulfils
these criteria for most long-distance migrants to the area.

In the Eastern Mediterranean, detections
tend to be characterised by Asian and some
North African migrants illegally crossing the
border from Turkey into Greece. In the second half of 2012, detections were much reduced following increased operational activity
at the Greek land border with Turkey (Aspida), where most detections were previously
reported. In response, detections increased
elsewhere in the region, though to a much
lesser extent, resulting in an overall decrease
in Q4 2012 (Fig. 5).

During Q3 2012 detections in the Central
Mediterranean were higher than at any point
during 2009 or 2010, following increased detections of Somalis and Eritreans and a steady
and significant trend of Tunisians. In Q4 2012
there was an overall decline in the number of
migrants arriving in the region mostly due to
fewer North African nationalities such as Tunisians and Egyptians. However, there was a
surge of migrants from sub-Saharan countries such as Eritrea, the Gambia and Mali,
all of which were detected in much higher
numbers than during the previous quarter –
hence opposing seasonal declines expected
at this time of year and observed for many
other nationalities.

On the main Central Mediterranean route,
which includes the Italian Pelagic Islands (e.g.
Lampedusa) and Malta, detections tend to be
of migrants arriving on boats from North Africa. In some cases migrants arrive from their

Figure 5.Towards the end of 2012 detections of illegal border-crossing fell in the Eastern

nel (having a laissez-passer issued by the
national embassy and trying to cross through
the BCP Kipi), or illegally by trying to cross the
Greek-Turkish border. They are mainly Syrian
nationals and, to a lesser extent, nationals of
Somalia, Iraq or Egypt. They may be returning to Turkey either to facilitate more migrants (as many of them have been waiting
in Greece for a long time and are in desperate need of money), or to find another route
to reach their final destinations.

Since data collection began in early 2008,
the Eastern Mediterranean has maintained
its status as a major hotspot of irregular migration into the Schengen area. Detections
have followed a remarkably seasonal pattern invariably peaking in the third quarter
of each year (Fig. 6) and concentrated at the
border between Greece and Turkey, with a
shift from the sea border to the land border
visible in late 2009.

Secondary movements

In recent quarters the most commonly detected have been migrants from Afghanistan,
Pakistan, Bangladesh, Algeria and, more recently, Syria. In Q4 2012 the most commonly
detected migrants in this region were from Afghanistan, Syria and Palestine but all in much
reduced numbers than previously reported.

Despite decreased detections at its land border with Turkey, Greece was still a major
entry point for detections of illegal bordercrossing in Q4 2012. However, as Greece is a
Schengen exclave and mostly a transit rather
than destination country, a similar composition of nationalities were also detected making secondary movements from Greece, and
attempting to re-enter the Schengen area
heading for their final destination countries.

A new trend among the migrants from Greece
has been recently noticed: the voluntary return to Turkey, either through the legal chan-

In Q4 2012, these movements tended to be
reflected in the detections of:
n	illegal border-crossing and clandestine entries throughout the Western Balkan land
borders;
n	migrants landing at the blue border of
the southern Italian regions of Apulia and
Calabria;
n	clandestines and document fraudsters on
board ferries to Italy (Ancona, Venice);
n	document fraudsters travelling on flights
from Greek airports to many major EU
airports.

increases during Q3 2012. Apparently, many of
them had been previously resident in Greece
for several years, while some Afghan nationals claimed to have worked in Pakistan for six
years, but due to the bad social and working
conditions decided to return to Afghanistan
and then to move to Europe to improve their
economic situation.
In contrast, in Q4 2012 other nationalities,
such as Syrian, Bangladeshi and Egyptian, responded to the seasonal weather changes and
were correspondingly detected in much lower
numbers than during the previous quarter.

Western Balkans
There were more than 10 500 detections
of illegal border-crossing between BCPs reported at borders between Western Balkan countries themselves or at their borders
with the neighbouring EU Member States.
The number was 24% higher than during the
same period in 2011 and 19% higher than during the previous quarter, which is surprising
given the poorer weather conditions at this
time of year. Nearly all of the increase was
due to more detections reported by Croatia.
In fact, under the framework of the Western
Balkans Risk Analysis Network, there were
more detections of illegal border-crossing reported by Croatia and Serbia than by any EU
Member State.
The growth of detections at the Croatian and
Slovenian borders also appears to be resulting
from a partial westward shift in the routing
as the irregular migrants were increasingly
attempting to cross from Serbia to Croatia
and further to Slovenia rather than to Hungary or Romania.

The JO Aeneas 2012 in Apulia and Calabria
started on 2 July and was extended until 2
January 2013. Overall, the percentage of incidents which involved departures from Greece
was as high as 78% (Fig. 7). According to operational reports, the decrease in the number of arrivals in Apulia and Calabria from
August 2012 was due the implementation of
the Greek police operation Aspida stemming
the flow of migrants. However, adding to the
flow were Greek police operations against
irregular migration in the centre of Athens
and in other cities of Greece which continued to push irregular migrants out of Greece.
Most of the boats departing from Greece are
pleasure boats as opposed to fishing boats

Figure 8 shows two boats that were detected
in November, a white luxury twin-engine
speed boat arrived in Calabria from Greece
with a smaller black dinghy in tow for disembarkation. There were 20 migrants on board.

In Q4 2012, there were nearly 900 detections of migrants travelling on intra-Schengen flights with fraudulent documents. These
intra-Schengen document fraudsters were
mostly detected by Italy (entry and exit) and
Greece (exit), where numbers were increasing
throughout 2012, and, to a lesser extent, by
Germany (entry), where numbers were decreasing. Syrians continued to be the most
detected nationality particularly on flights
between Greece and Germany, followed by
increasing numbers of Somalis on flights both
ways between Italy and Denmark.
4.2.2. Central Mediterranean route
Irregular migration in the Central Mediterranean massively fluctuated in size and composition during 2011, largely due to the political
and civil unrest across North Africa, particularly in Tunisia and Libya. Since Q4 2011, the
situation has significantly improved following better cooperation between Italian and
Tunisian authorities concerning the return of
Tunisian nationals.
According to FRAN data, in Q4 2012 there
were 3 476 reported detections of illegal border-crossing on the main Central Mediterranean route (Italian Pelagic Islands, Sicily
and Malta), almost exactly the same number as in the previous quarter and significantly higher than any other quarter both
before and after the Arab Spring. However,
this figure concealed seasonal decreases for
some commonly nationalities and significant
increases for others.

Intra-Schengen flights

Figure 8. In November, a luxury twinengine speed boat was detected carrying
20 migrants from Greece to Calabria, with a

Since early 2011, migrants from Tunisia have
been among the most commonly detected
migrants arriving in the Central Mediterranean region. During the previous quarter they ranked first among nationalities
detected in the region with around 1 000
detections. However, in Q4 2012 detections
of Tunisian migrants in the Central Mediterranean fell to just 230, which can probably be interpreted as a seasonal decline.
Based on this interpretation, an increase in
the number of detected Tunisians should be
expected in 2013.
In accordance with the ‘Processo Verbale’
of 5 April 2011 (an agreement between Italy and Tunisia on cooperation in the field
of migration policy) in November and December 2012, Tunisian nationals were returned to Tunis or were recovered by the
Tunisian authorities in international waters. In 2012, Italian authorities delivered
two patrol boats to the Tunisian authorities in order to improve the fight against
the trafficking of human beings and irregular immigration. Consistent with declining
numbers of Tunisians, detections of Egyptian migrants arriving in the Central Mediterranean region also fell, in this case from
287 in Q3 to just 135 in Q4 2012.

the Libyan authorities remains critical, both
on land and at sea (Fig. 9).
In 2012, Italy conducted a series of training programmes for the Libyan police in the
framework of the SAH-MED Project; in November a meeting was held at the IMO headquarters in Rome under the framework of
the implementation of the SAH-MED Project,
with the aim of involving the Italian Council
for Refugees (CIR), in relation to the issues
of humanitarian assistance and protection
of rights, taking into account the changed
needs of Libya at the end of the war.

There was also a very large increase in the
number of Syrians detected in the Central
Mediterranean region from just five in Q3
to nearly 100 in Q4 2012, which is consistent with widespread increased detections of
this nationality across border sections. However, there is currently no evidence to suggest that the Central Mediterranean area is
likely to become the main point of entry for
Syrian migrants.

Figure 9.Sub-Saharan migrants arrived in the Central Mediterranean

In contrast to decreased detections of migrants from North Africa, there were significant increases compared to the previous
quarter, in detections of migrants from several sub-Saharan countries such as Eritrea (+200%), the Gambia (+90%) and Mali
(+350%), as well as a steady and significant flow of migrants from Somalia, now
ranked second in the region behind Eritreans. Most of these migrants departed from
Libya, where, due to a paucity of ground vehicles and boats, low technical and professional levels of the new police forces, the

The JO Hermes 2012 was originally scheduled to finish on 31 October 2012, but after
requests from the hosting Member States
and based on risk analyses, decisions were
taken to extend the JO first until 15 December 2012 and further on until 31 January 2013.
The JO Hermes 2012 Extension was established to support the Italian authorities in
tackling maritime illegal migration on the
coasts of Sicily, Pantelleria and the Pelagic
Islands (Lampedusa, Linosa, Lampione).
Prices for the facilitation from the Horn of Africa towards Italy range between USD 1 200
and USD 1 500 per person. Migrants reach
Khartoum/Sudan by themselves and start
to pay facilitation networks from there. Migrants from West Africa and sub-Saharan
countries often do not use the help of facilitation networks until they reach the border
of Libya and pay significantly less.

4.2.3. Western Mediterranean route
In Q4 2012 there were nearly 1 900 detections of illegal border-crossing in the Western Mediterranean region, which consists of
several areas of the southern Spanish coast as
well as the land borders of Ceuta and Melilla,
where almost exactly half of all detections
were reported. Going into the final quarter of
the year there were vastly increased detections of migrants from Chad, Cameroon, Mali
and Guinea arriving in the region of Cadiz.
As has been the case for several years, the
most commonly detected migrants were
from Algeria, followed by migrants of unknown nationality (presumed to be sub-Saharan Africans), both of which were mostly
reported from the land borders with Morocco.
Since the beginning of October there were
several attempts to cross the fence in Melilla.
The most serious involved around 300 subSaharans, of which around 100 succeeded
in passing the fence but were subsequently
found and returned to Morocco. According
to open sources the incident occurred in the
Gold River area unusually in broad daylight
and, as a result, the top of the six-feet high

Figure 10.In October a group of around 300
sub-Saharans attempted to enter Melilla by

fence was visibly damaged. The incident is
the largest on a single day on the Melilla border since 2005. These reports are consistent
with growing migrant settlements in the region which indicate an increasing likelihood
of further events.
The JO Indalo 2012 started in this region on
16 May and ran until 31 October 2012 covering
five zones of the south-eastern Spanish sea
border and extending into the western Mediterranean. Consistent with previous years,
the operational area of the JO Indalo continued to be affected by migratory flows mainly
originating from North African and sub-Saharan countries, which follow a similar seasonal
pattern. Overall there was a 4% decrease in

is the main gathering point for migrants originating from the Horn of Africa. From there, a
second destination close to the beach is the
final stopover before embarking the boats
for the crossing to Italy. Some migrants reported that they got afraid when seeing the
relatively small rubber dinghies and refused
to enter them. Armed guards beat them and
forced them to board the boats, not letting
anyone leave.

There are still reports about extreme violence
against black African nationals in Libya. Most
of the migrants reported to have been beaten
by Libyan police after being arrested and also
by members of the facilitation networks.

There were almost equal numbers of irregular migrants claiming to be from North African countries and the sub-Saharan region.
According to the operational data, sub-Saharan migrants claimed to originate mostly
from Chad, Guinea Conakry and Mali, whilst
most of the migrants from North African
countries claimed to be from Algeria and
Morocco.
4.2.4. Western African route
In the final quarter of 2012, there were just
91 detections of illegal border-crossing in
this region, which is more than double the
number reported during the previous quarter and goes against expected seasonal declines at this time of year. This increase was
almost entirely due to migrants from the
Gambia, who arrived in the Canary Islands
in December significantly adding to the consistent but relatively low flow of Moroccans
arriving in this area.
Despite the arrivals of Gambians, the total number of 91 detections was still lower
than during the same period in 2011 (i.e. 112,
almost exclusively Moroccans). The high level
of cooperation between the Spanish, Senegalese and Mauritanian authorities performing joint patrols at sea and on the coastline
of these countries has been a significant deterrent factor to prevent irregular migration
flows from Senegal and Mauritania towards
the Canary Islands.
According to information collected during interviews, Moroccan migrants were:
n	mainly lower-class single adult males who
were lacking opportunities of work, welfare and access to public health services;
n	mainly Arabic-speaking migrants who
were undocumented to avoid repatria-

Most migration incidents in 2012 involved

without facilitators on board.
4.2.5. Eastern borders route
The eastern land borders route is, in effect,
an amalgam of detections of illegal bordercrossing reported by Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and
Romania. Despite the total length of all the
border sections, detections tend to be lower
than on other routes possibly due to the long
distances between major hubs and many
countries of origins. Also according to several bi-monthly analytical reports shared at
the end of 2012, visa fraud and counterfeit
border-crossing stamps tend to predominate
on this route, as opposed to detections of il-

legal border-crossing (see Section 4.8. Document fraud).

According to open sources, 56 Vietnamese
migrants were caught in 2012 while trying
to cross to border from the Russian Federation to Estonia. Starting from the autumn of
2011 there was a significant increase in detections of illegal border-crossing committed
by Vietnamese observed by Estonian, Lithuanian and Polish border guards. In all these
cases their destination countries were Poland or Germany (see Section 4.4. Detections of facilitators).
The Action Plan of the Ministry of Education of Belarus (2011–2015) suggests that
the number of foreign students in Belarusian universities should grow to three times
the current level such that Belarusian high
schools would accommodate some 15 000
foreign students. According to state statistics for 2011, only 2% of all students of universities in Belarus were foreigners, mostly
citizens of Turkmenistan, China and Syria.
The size of the Syrian diaspora in Belarus is
estimated to be approximately 70 000 persons, which is probably a strong pull factor
for Syrians hoping to move towards the EU.

In Q4 2012, there were just 437 detections of
illegal border-crossing at the eastern land
borders of the EU, which is almost exactly
the same figure as for the previous quarter.
However, this stable trend in the total number conceals much variation between nationalities. For example, there was a sharp
increase in detections of migrants from Vietnam, coinciding with stable trends of migrants from Georgia and Somalia, and fewer
detections of migrants from the Russian Federation and Moldova.

Vietnamese nationals and one Armenian were caught trying to

about foreigner residents living in Belarus
vastly underestimate the actual size of foreigner communities.
At the Latvian border with the Russian Federation, the Russian Federal Border Guard
Service continued to detect Africans with
forged travel documents heading towards
the Schengen area. On some occasions, migrants whose travel documents were in question were denied boarding trains.
The situation in Syria is used by other thirdcountry nationals who arrive at BCPs, identifying themselves as Syrian nationals in order
to ask for asylum.

4.2.6. Western Balkans route
There were 10 699 detections of illegal border-crossing between BCPs reported at both
common and regional borders. The number
was 24% higher compared to corresponding
quarter in 2011 and 19% higher when compared with the previous quarter.
At the regional level the picture is mixed. The
total number of detected cases reported by
EU Member States (Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Greece) decreased by 12%
(2 846) in Q4 2012 compared with the previous quarter, but at the same time Serbia reported the highest quarterly figure since the
start of the WB-RAN in 2010. Moreover, Croatia reported a very strong growth (+80%)
in comparison with the previous quarter. It
is notable that the numbers of detections
by Serbia and Croatia in the fourth quarter
were higher than of any EU Member State,
including Greece.
These observations would indicate that the
Xenios Zeus and Aspida operations in Greece,
that resulted in plunging numbers of detections at the Greek-Turkish land border, did
not yet have the expected corresponding
impact on the secondary movements from
Greece through the Western Balkans. A possible explanation may be that those irregular
migrants detected in Western Balkan countries had stayed in Greece for a longer period
of time before opting to leave the country
due to lack of job opportunities and/or increased inland activities by the Greek police.
The Western Balkans route may have become
more popular also due to increased controls
at Greek ports on the route towards Italy.
Considering the trends in the Western Balkans, the trend of detections on the route
from Greece via the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to Serbia remains relatively stable with a 17% rise compared to
the previous quarter and a 7.9% decrease

26 of 62

in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2011.
However, the pressure grew substantially
at the northern end of the route compared
with the previous quarter, particularly at the
Croatia-Serbia (+66%) and Croatia-Slovenia
(+98%) border sections. The difference might
result from a time gap in the movement of
migrants from the southern part of the area
towards the north.
The growth in detections at the Croatian and
Slovenian borders also appears to be resulting
from a partial westward shift in the routing
as the irregular migrants were increasingly
attempting to cross from Serbia to Croatia
and further to Slovenia rather than to Hungary or Romania.
In terms of nationalities, two-thirds of all detections (over 6 600) continued to be linked
to migrants who had entered the Western
Balkans en route from Greece (i.e. Afghans,
Pakistanis, Somalis, Syrians, Eritreans and Algerians). Despite a slightly lower number of
Afghans, they remained the largest nationality. The number of detected Syrians continued to rise steeply compared to the previous
quarter (+141%). Of the top ten nationalities,
nationals of Eritrea and Mali were the fastest growing group of migrants in comparison with the previous quarter.
Detections of Albanian nationals remained
relatively stable in comparison with the corresponding quarter of 2011 (+3.8%), though grew
(+22%) in relation to the previous quarter.
Hiding in vehicles
Detections of migrants hiding in vehicles continued to increase during the fourth quarter
of 2012, both compared to the third quarter (+8.4%) and the corresponding quarter
of 2011 (+56). More precisely, there were 803
migrants detected illegally crossing the border at BCPs, mostly reported by Serbia, followed by Croatia and Slovenia. The border

section between Croatia and Serbia became
the top reporting section with a 26% share
of the regional total.
Similar to detections of illegal border-crossing between BCPs, Serbia also detected the
largest share (40%) of all cases of illegal border-crossing at BCPs.
Afghans remained the top detected nationality with a 26% share (207). Similar to detections of illegal border-crossing between BCPs,
the number of Syrians detected at BCPs increased significantly (+480%, 116) against the
previous quarter.
There is considerable variation in the modus
operandi as regards the points of departure
(either non-stop from Greece or over several
legs through the Western Balkans) and types
of vehicles used (cars, buses, cargo/passenger trains). In some reported cases irregular
migrants were found in cargo carriages of
international trains departing from Greece,
hidden in containers.
The direct route from Greece via Western Balkan countries to the EU appears to be more
costly and requires better organisation, while
the journey made over several legs through
Western Balkan countries is cheaper and
probably more improvised. Inside Western
Balkan countries, migrants most probably
board lorries at truck rest stops.
These trends suggest that more migrants en
route from Greece still opt for crossing the
regional and common borders hidden in vehicles (as reported in previous Western Balkans
Quarterlies and WB-ARA 2012). It should be
pointed out that this modus operandi involves a
high risk of loss of life, especially when closed
hidden compartments are used in cars, buses,
trains and freight containers.

Claiming asylum to circumvent entry
provisions
The share of the six Western Balkan countries
rose from 1 012 in the third quarter to 1 220
in the fourth quarter. In conclusion, claiming asylum in the Western Balkans itself and
absconding afterwards continues to grow as
a part of the well-known modus operandi to
move from Greece towards other EU Member States (secondary movements).
Overall asylum applications increased substantially both compared with the previous
quarter (33%) and the corresponding quarter of 2011 (+39). However, there was a considerable variation between the countries
considering the trends and top nationalities. There was a strong increase in asylum
applications in Greece (50%), which was for
the most part due to an increased number
of applications by nationals of Pakistan and
Bangladesh. In Hungary, Afghan nationals
were the largest group, followed by Kosovans*, Pakistanis and Syrians.
In Bulgaria, asylum applications more than
doubled. Applications of Syrian nationals
– mostly made inland – grew more than
twice in the fourth quarter and accounted
for 40% of the Bulgaria’s total. This is most
probably due to the shift of detections of illegal border-crossing from the Greek-Turkish
land border towards the Bulgarian-Turkish border. In Romania, however, the trend
was quite opposite with decreasing numbers of applications both by Pakistani and
Syrian nationals.

* This designation is
without prejudice to
positions on status, and is
in line with UNSCR 1244
and the ICJ Opinion on
the Kosovo declaration of
independence.

Considering the nationalities of the region,
Kosovans* increasingly applied for asylum
in Hungary.
A steep increase in asylum applications in
Montenegro that started in the second quarter continued in Q4. The phenomenon was

27 of 62

Frontex · FRAN Quarterly · q4 2012

largely driven by applicants from Algeria who
were en route from Greece through Albania.
The number of asylum applications in Serbia
was at a very low level compared with other
indicators. This is due to the fact that most
migrants expressed their wish to claim asylum but later absconded without formally
submitting an asylum application.

4.3. Clandestine entry
Restricting the FRAN indicator on detections
of illegal border-crossing at BCPs (1B) to the
external land and sea borders of the EU and
to detections confirmed to be clandestine
entries (e.g. hiding in means of transport)
results in extremely low detections for the
whole of the EU especially compared with
other indicators, such as detections of illegal border-crossing between BCPs. For example, in Q4 2012, only 195 detections were
reported from the whole FRAN community
(see Section 4.2.6. Western Balkans route).
Nevertheless, this was the highest number of
clandestine entry detections since data collection began for this indicator in 2009, and,
following steady increases throughout 2012, it
was more than double the number reported
a year previously in Q4 2011.

According to data collected during Focal
Points Land 2012, hiding aboard cargo trains
has become one of the most common modi
operandi of illegal border-crossing from Greece
into Western Balkan countries. Specifically, irregular migrants hide on cargo trains in Thessaloniki or close to the railway BCP Idomeni
at the Greek border with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The migrants
jump off cargo trains at the first stop in the
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and
then continue towards Serbia either as:
1.	regular passengers aboard passenger
trains;
2.	regular passengers aboard other public
transportation; or
3. hidden aboard other trains.

In Q4 2012, safe houses in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, organised by
Afghan, Pakistani and Arabic-speaking facilitators close to the border with Serbia, were
offering irregular migrants shelter for a couple
of days when weather conditions prevented
crossing the border to Serbia on foot (Fig 15).
Figure 14.Well-prepared migrants were
detected with equipment to assist in
attempts of clandestine entry

28 of 62

Some of the increase throughout 2012 was
due to increased detections reported by Slovenia and Bulgaria. In the case of Slovenia,
which reported more detections in Q4 2012
than any other Member State, most of the
increases were due to Afghan migrants increasingly detected at the border with Croatia. Nearly all of these Afghan migrants were
making secondary movements after initially
entering the Schengen area in Greece (see
Section 4.2.6. Western Balkans route). In Bulgaria the increased detections of clandestine
entries at BCPs were due to more migrants
from Syria and Palestine, who were increasingly detected at the land border with Turkey
– probably as a displacement effect from the
Greek land border with Turkey.

In contrast to the low number of detections
of clandestine entry at the external border,
there were more detections within the EU/

Schengen area (470). Although higher than at
the external border, this figure was a reduction of around a half compared to the previous quarter. The geographical distribution
of these ‘internal’ detections sheds light on
the direction of secondary movements and
the final destination countries selected by
each nationality. For example, the UK (247)
and Italy (172) reported the greatest number
of internally detected clandestine irregular
migrants. The most significant trends were
increasing numbers of Albanians detected
attempting entry to the UK (probably using
the ferry connections and the Channel Tunnel), and fewer Afghans arriving in Ancona,
(Italy) hidden on ferries from Greece.

4.4. Detections of facilitators
Notwithstanding an increase during the first
few months of 2011, detections of facilitators of irregular migration have been falling
steadily for the last two years. According to
some reports, this long-term decline may in
part be due to a widespread shift towards
the abuse of legal channels and document
fraud to mimic legal entry to the EU, which
allows facilitators to operate remotely and
inconspicuously rather than accompanying
migrants during high-risk activities such as
border-crossing.

Lojane in the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia, close to the border with Serbia,

Figure 16.An organised crime group was
detected applying for Czech residence
permits for non-EU citizens based on sham
marriages

In contrast to this long-term decline, in Q4
2012, there were 2 118 detections of facilitators of irregular migration, which is an
increase of 24% since the previous quarter, and the largest number of facilitators
detected in a single quarter for over two
years (Fig. 1).
The total EU-level detections of facilitators
of irregular migration tend to be made up of
several disparate trends involving unrelated
nationalities detected for a range of activities in different Member States. For example,
much of the increase during the last quarter of 2012 was due to more detections of
Moroccan and Spanish nationals inland in
Spain, whereas significant decreases were
reported in the number of Italian facilitators
detected in Italy.
Member States tend to detect more domestic facilitators than any other nationality;
very often most of the top reporting countries for this indicator tend to report their
own citizens as facilitators more frequently
than any other single nationality. However,
on this occasion Spain reported more Moroccan, Hungary detected more Serbian and
Greece detected more Albanian facilitators
than domestic ones.

Spain reported more facilitators of irregular migration than any other Member State,
and more than double the number reported
a year previously in Q4 2011 (Fig. 17). A lot of
this increase was due to more Moroccan facilitators detected inland, as well as more Pakistanis, Dominicans and Iranians.

4.5. Detections of illegal stay
In Q4 2012, there were nearly 85 000 detections of illegal stay in the EU, which is more
or less a stable trend compared to the year

30 of 62

before and compared to most recent reporting periods. This is consistent with a stable
but slightly declining long-term trend over
the last two years (Fig. 1). However, this longterm decline masks much variation among
Member States.
The vast majority of migrants staying illegally were detected inland (68 319) and so
are presumed to be long-term illegal stayers as, at the time of detection, they were
making no attempt to leave. The next most
common location for detections of illegal

periods.

in the number of detections of illegal stayers
with a steady trend of Afghans as the most
commonly detected nationality. In contrast,
detections of Syrians (inland), Brazilians (air
border) and Georgians (inland) all increased
significantly in Germany throughout 2012.

Germany reported by far the most detections of migrants staying illegally, followed
by Sweden. However, in Sweden nearly all
reported illegal stayers were actually asylum
seekers, and so are not considered further
here. In Germany there was a 24% increase

Of the exchanged data that were suitable for
analysis (Swedish data included asylum seekers and all inland detections in Switzerland
were of unknown nationalities), the most significant phenomena relating to illegal stay
were Algerians detected inland in Belgium,

Figure 19.In Q4 2012, nearly a third of all refusals of entry were issued by Poland, where
Ukrainians and Georgians were most commonly refused entry at land border with Ukraine
and Belarus, respectively

Moroccans detected inland in Spain and Pakistanis detected in Greece. What is surprising is that, despite reporting the most illegally
staying migrants, Germany does not appear
high up in the list of phenomena (linked to
single nationalities) – this is because in Q4
2012 Germany detected over 130 different nationalities of illegally staying migrants in relatively low numbers per nationality, whereas
Austria only reported around 90 nationalities but in average higher numbers of each.

4.6. Refusals of entry
In Q4 2012, there were nearly 32 000 refusals
of entry at the external border, with about
60% refused from the land border and most
of the remainder being refused from the sea
border. In the context of recent years this figure has only been exceeded in a single quarter on two occasions since data collection
began in early 2009. One of those occasions
was in the previous quarter, suggesting that
refusals of entry are currently in a period of
extremely high frequency.

Figure 20.In Q4 2012, nearly half of all asylum applications were submitted either in Sweden
or in Germany, where more applications were submitted than in any other Member State in

inland asylum applications in Q3 and Q4 2012 and the breakdown by nationality for inland asylum applications for all of
2012 are not available at this moment.

As has been the case for most other reporting periods, Poland refused the most migrants (Fig. 19), mainly Ukrainian nationals
at their land border. Overall more than twothirds of all refused Ukrainian nationals were
refused entry by Poland but the percentage
was even higher for Georgians, 94% of whom
were refused entry by Poland. Indeed, Ukrainians refused entry at the Polish border with
Ukraine, and Georgians refused entry at the
Polish land border with Belarus were the two

most common phenomena at the EU level.
Ranking third were Albanians refused entry
at the Greek land border with Albania. In total
these three phenomena accounted for nearly
a third of all refusals of entry at the EU level.
Although from rather low bases, there were
three trends that increased dramatically during 2012. The first was Armenians refused entry at the Polish land border with Belarus,
which increased tenfold from Q1 to Q4 2012.

33 of 62

Frontex · FRAN Quarterly · q4 2012

The second was Russians refused entry at the
Latvian land border with the Russian Federation, and the third was Syrians refused entry at Charles de Gaul airport.
Refusals of entry increased dramatically in
Latvia compared to the year before, almost
exclusively at the Latvian land border with
the Russian Federation, where significantly
more Russian nationals were refused entry.
The reasons for refusals were (E) no appropriate documentation justifying the purpose
and conditions of stay, and (C) no valid via or
residence permit.

4.7. Asylum claims
In Q4 2012, there were far more applications
for asylum in the EU since data collection began in early 2008. The number of claims increased steadily throughout 2012 from just
over 55 000 in Q1 to a staggering 83 446
applications in the current reporting period
(note – the FRAN data do not include asylum applications submitted inland in France).
As previously reported, much of this increase
resulted from many more applications submitted by Syrian and, to a lesser extent, Serbian and Russian nationals with particularly
strong increases toward the end of the year.
As well as the nationalities that submitted
increasing numbers of applications, there
was also a steady but very significant trend
of claims submitted by Afghan nationals –
ranking second at the EU level.
With an overwhelming 31% of all applications
submitted in the EU/Schengen area and following a nearly 43% increase compared to
the previous quarter, Germany received by
far the most applications for international
protection, and more than reported by any
Member State in a single quarter since data
collection began in early 2008.
Without question, the most significant trend
throughout 2012 as a whole and during the

34 of 62

final quarter of the year was increased applications submitted by Syrian nationals, which
in Q4 2012 increased to nearly 9 000 applications and 11% of the EU total. This amounted
to more applications submitted by a single
nationality in any given quarter since data
collection began for this indicator. Given that
Syrians are still highly detected illegally crossing the border of the EU and as document
fraudsters, and that the civil war shows no
signs of abating, this flow of asylum seekers
is likely to continue.

4.8. Document fraud
In January 2012 Frontex and the FRAN community embarked on a detailed and ambitious information-sharing project in the field
of document fraud, to be overseen by a new
specialist sub-network of the FRAN known
as the European Union Document-Fraud Risk
Analysis Network (EDF-RAN). The following
section utilises these data for a situational
picture of the final quarter of 2012.
The migrants most associated with document
fraud to enter the EU or Schengen area from
third countries in Q4 2012 were from Albania,
Syria and, to a lesser extent, Morocco, Turkey,
Tunisia and Nigeria. With the exception of Nigerians, all these nationalities were detected
in increasing numbers throughout 2012, especially Syrians, detections of whom, on entry
from third countries, increased 14-fold between the first and final quarters of the year.
Document fraud between the Schengen area
and non-Schengen countries was also dominated by increasing numbers of Albanian nationals throughout 2012, mostly associated
with travel to the UK from the Schengen area.
Within the Schengen area document fraud
was characterised by increasing numbers of
Syrians and Somalis, and fewer Afghan migrants on flights from Greece.

Migrants from Syria
Migrants from Syria were increasingly detected
as document fraudsters across Member States,
such that there was an overall sixfold increase
since the beginning of the year (including all
travel types). More than half of all detections
were on extra-Schengen flights, which is a
complete reverse from the previous quarter
when most were detected on intra-Schengen flights from Greece. In the final quarter
of 2012 the most common embarkation point
for Syrian document fraudsters was Istanbul,
from where detections increased massively
from three or four per quarter during the first
semester to 133 in Q4 2012.

A large proportion of the increase in detections of document fraud was due to a single
phenomenon; the use of counterfeit border-crossing stamps by Albanian nationals
to fabricate travel histories and extend periods of stay. These migrants were almost exclusively detected on entry to Greece, at the
BCP Kakavia and, to a lesser extent, at the
BCP Kristalopigi. Of all Albanian migrants detected on entry to the Schengen area from a
third country, nearly all were detected with
otherwise authentic Albanian passports, containing counterfeit Greek border-crossing
stamps (Fig. 22).

© Frontex Reference Manual

According to a sample of 24 Member States
and Schengen Associated Countries, in Q4
2012 there were 2 572 detections of document
fraud on entry to the EU/Schengen area from
third countries. Although long-term comparisons were not possible for Member States
new to the EDF-RAN (Sweden and Slovenia), or for those currently unable to meet
the strict reporting protocols (France), it is
clear that at the EU level document fraud to
enter the EU and Schengen area from third
countries was increasing throughout 2012.

Ukrainian biometric passport law
comes into force
In December the president of Ukraine
signed a new law in which the introduction of electronic passports was announced. Although the implementation
rules have not yet been finalised, the
government hopes to start issuing the
passports in January 2013. However, several aspects of the new law and the new
passport have already come under considerable criticism. For example, a revision to the law suggests that people
with certain religious beliefs be able to
opt out of having their personal information on the electronic chip. To exercise
this right, individuals need only submit
an application for exemption. According to several Member State analyses,
this is exactly the type of loophole that
could be exploited by criminals so that
they can continue to move around with
fraudulent identity documents without
the possibility of being checked against
biometric data on the chip.
This new law stipulates that the passport will be in the form of a card containing a contactless electronic carrier
with biographical information as well
as biometric identifiers and so does not
comply with international standards.
The new law also stipulates that passports are to be issued to all individuals
from birth regardless of age, for a period of 10 years.
There are suggestions that Ukrainian legislators have not considered those that
require extra protection in Ukraine, as
some citizens will not be granted biometric travel documents.

4.8.2. Between the EU and
the Schengen area
In Q4 2012, there were 1 213 detections of
document fraudsters made at the borders
between the Schengen area and non-Schengen EU Member States, which is a 50% increase since the previous quarter and the
highest level since basic data collection began
in 2009. As was the case in previous reporting periods detections were equally split between the two directions of passenger flow
(entry/exit) even though the UK does not perform any exit checks. Most of the flow was
on exit from the Schengen area towards the
UK, which correspondingly reported the most
detections overall and on entry.
The overwhelming majority of migrants detected using fraudulent documents between
the Schengen area and non-Schengen EU
Member States were from Albania, with more
than 50% of the total share. This route of
document fraud started in 2011 once Albanians were granted visa-free access to the
Schengen area.
Albanian migrants were most frequently detected using forged, counterfeit and stolen
blank Italian ID cards, followed by counterfeit
and forged Greek ID cards. The only passports
detected on this route were forged Greek and
Bulgarian, in which new biopages were most
frequently found.
Migrants from Ukraine were also detected
in significant numbers travelling between
the Schengen area and the UK, as were migrants from Iran and increasingly Syria but
all in much lower numbers than migrants
from Albania.
4.8.3. Intra-Schengen
Throughout the first half of 2012 there was a
major flow of migrants using fraudulent documents to fly from Greece to other Schengen

36 of 62

During the first six months of 2012 nearly 500
migrants were detected on flights between
Greece and other Schengen states, either
on exit from Greek airports or upon arrival
mostly in Germany and, to a lesser extent,
Italy. However, since the deployment of the
Greek operation Aspida there has been a decline in document fraudsters arriving on flights
from Greece, suggesting that the lower number of migrants entering Greece from Turkey
is having an impact on detections of document fraud elsewhere in the Schengen area.
In contrast to the decline in the number of
migrants arriving on flights from Greece, Italy
has been detecting more document fraudsters on ferries from Patras.
4.8.4. Legal channels
Although lacking a systematic data exchange
among Member States, many reports conclude that the abuse of legal channels to illegally enter the EU is increasing.
In Poland there were several cases of fraudulently obtained business or work visas being
used by Ukrainian migrants. In addition, since
May 2012 there was a significant increase in
detections of Ukrainian (and, to a lesser extent, Moldovan and Belarusian) nationals using fraudulently obtained Greek visas. Above
mentioned migrants were in possession of
visas entitling them to attend sport events
and tourist visas issued in Ukraine by Greek
consulates, but organised by travel offices in
Kiev. However, the migrants whose destination country was Italy did not have any documents relating to room reservations or other
logistical arrangements.

states. As most of these migrants originally
entered Greece illegally via the land border
with Turkey, these journeys are known as secondary movements and shed much light on
flows of nationalities, documents used and
destination countries.

common fraudulent documents used by

In Q4 2012 there was an increase in the
number of refused irregular migrants arriving in Belgium with Italian D-Visa for
labour. In many cases, the migrants cannot give any explanation about their employer, their job contract, their wages,
the working schedule or how long they
will stay in Italy to work. Mostly the
contacts with the employer go via
friends or family who already reside in Italy.

Sham marriage mastermind jailed for 10 years
In February 2013 a solicitor was jailed for 10 years in London
for running an immigration sham marriage scam. The solicitor and two immigration advisers were found guilty of conspiracy to breach immigration law.
The judge said it would be hard to find a similar scam of the
same scale and sophistication. He added: ‘A heavy responsibility for upholding the law rests with the lawyers. If the public
cannot trust them, who can they trust? You have destroyed
that trust by driving a coach and horses through these rules.’
An estimated 1 800 men, including members of the Albanian mafia, were able to live in Britain by taking part in sham
marriages over eight years. Women from eastern European
countries were flown to Britain to marry men from outside
the EU. They turned up at register offices having never met,
and were sometimes unable to speak a common language.
Men would pay up to GBP 14 000 to the solicitors for a marriage package. This would include fake tenancy agreements,
employer’s references and forged documents.
Clients would travel from as far as Devon and Scotland and
marriages would take place in a number of registrars’ offices.
Only GBP 2 million of unexplained income had been found in
bank accounts. The rest is thought to have been smuggled
out of the country. The racket was uncovered after British
police cracked an Albanian drugs and money laundering

New definitions applied to this indicator by
Italy in early 2012 resulted in a huge increase
in this single Member State, now ranking third
at the EU level. However, despite this administrative increase, there was a 9% decrease in
the number of third-country nationals subject to an obligation to leave the EU as a result of an administrative or judicial decision
in Q4 2012 compared to the same period in
2011. Most of this decrease was due to the
situation in Greece, the Member State that
reaches more decisions than in any other. In
this Member State, where a fifth of all decisions were reached, the number of decisions
more than halved, following similar declines
in the number of detections of illegal border-crossing resulting from operational activity at the Greek land border with Turkey.
It is worth pointing out that the absolute total number of migrants subject to return decisions is still underestimated by this indicator,
as data on decisions were unavailable from,
inter alia, France, the Netherlands and Sweden, where it is assumed that high numbers
of decisions were reached.
Hence, in Italy the number of return decisions rose by more than 7 500 compared to
the same quarter in 2011 following the administrative change, and also the number of
decisions in Greece fell by more than 15 500
due to fewer illegal border-crossings from
Turkey. Given these significant changes, it
is not surprising that the nationalities that
were subject to the biggest changes in the
number of decisions reached were associated
with these two Member States. For example, migrants from Pakistan and Afghanistan
– ranked first and fourth among nationalities, respectively – were subject to far fewer
decisions to leave Greece, as they were detected as illegal border-crossers in far fewer

numbers than a year ago. Similarly migrants
from Albania were subject to more decisions
to leave Italy following reporting changes.
In the final quarter of 2012, Syrians were
the only nationality that was subject to significantly more decisions to leave than a
year previously (+165%), although few Syrians would have left following these decisions. Most of these decisions were reached
by Greece with some decline following the
launch of the Greek operation Aspida in August 2012, but still massively increased compared to the migration and return situation
for Syrians a year before in Q4 2011.
At the Member State level there is often a
discrepancy between the number of return
decisions reached and the number of effective returns carried out. Some of the differences may be due to time lags between
judicial decisions and physical returns, while
other differences may be due to the disappearance of migrants once a decision has
been reached. The largest discrepancy was in
Italy, where far more decisions were reached
than carried out, and, to a smaller extent, in
Greece. In contrast, more Albanians were
returned from Greece than were subject to
return decisions, suggesting that the time
lag was having an effect on the figures in
this case.
4.9.2. Effective returns
In Q4 2012, there was a steady trend in the
number of third-country nationals effectively
returned to outside the EU compared to a
year previously in Q4 2011. The total number of 42 157, however, represented a 10% increase compared to the previous quarter but
does not include effective returns between
Member States. As has been the case during every quarter of data exchange so far
for this indicator, the UK was the Member
State conducting the largest number of returns, in this case up by 5% compared to the

previous quarter, with steady trends of returned nationals from India and Pakistan. As
regards the top combinations of the returning Member State and the returned nationality, ranking first and second at the EU level,
with steady but slightly increasing trends,
were Albanians returned by Greece and Indians returned by the UK. In contrast, massive increases were reported for the number
of Pakistanis and Bangladeshis returned form
Greece. The previously reported trend of increased returns of Ukrainians from Poland
continued into the final quarter of the year.
The number of returns from Greece increased
dramatically between the third and fourth
quarters of 2012, following the launch of the
operation Xenios Zeus, which has been underway since 2 August 2012 targeting illegal
stayers mostly in Athens but also in some
other urban areas. Albanians were the most
returned nationality from Greece but with a
steady trend over the year possibly unrelated
to the operation as Albanians are very integrated in Greek society and are unlikely to be
associated with conspicuous groups of migrants gathering in urban areas. In contrast
much of the increase was due to more migrants from Pakistan and Bangladesh (ranked
second and third in Greece) being forcibly returned in much higher numbers during the
fourth quarter of 2012, almost certainly as a
result of the operation Xenios Zeus.
Consistent with these figures, open sources
suggest that the operation Xenios Zeus is
still very active. For example, in January 2012
there were reports of Greek police arresting 100 migrants in old factories in the port
city of Patra. Apparently, migrants who did
not possess proper residence papers were
expected to be taken to a detention centre
in the port of city of Corinth. Much of these
widely-publicised activities will also probably be contributing to the deterrent effect of
the operation Aspida at the Greek land border with Turkey, as migrants will be aware

that even if they successfully cross the border they are still likely to be picked up by the
authorities inland. In fact some open sources
claim that Greek police reports have come to
the same conclusion.

4.10. Other illegal activities at
the border
4.10.1. Smuggling of drugs
The smuggling of drugs continues to be a
serious concern for law-enforcement agencies along the external borders of the EU. Information from EU border authorities show
that the characteristics and extent of contraband of illicit substances along the traditional routes into the European markets is
not subject to fundamental changes. However, seizures, treatment demand and drug
market characteristics point to a slow diversification in terms of origin countries, modi operandi, routes and types of illicit substances
smuggled.

ders to the prospective EU Member Croatia,
border guards were able to confiscate more
than 100 kg of marijuana, which is a strong
increase compared to the 4.6 kg found in Q3.
The number of drug detections, however, decreased slightly, which means that the dimensions of the drug shipments – all detected at
the BCP Obrezje – were significantly larger.
On 1 October 2012, the JO Focal Points Land
reported the most significant seizure being
made during the forth quarter at the land borders, when 492 kg of marijuana were found
at the Hungarian BCP Kelebia. The illicit substance was transported behind double walls of
a lorry coming from Serbia, which was driven
by a national of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
The JO Aeneas 2012 showed its operational impact against the smuggling of drugs from the
Western Balkans with major seizures at the sea
border between Albania and Italy. In its opera-

Most of the cannabis resin consumed in Europe traditionally comes from Morocco, but
data gathered by UNODC show that the country’s importance as a supplier might be on the
decline, while the large yield of Afghanistan’s
cannabis crop leads to growing exports from
that country. At the same time, the Albanian
cannabis production is not subsiding despite
of increased law-enforcement action against
the cannabis farms and plants. While in 2009,
3 425 kg* of cannabis herb was seized by Albanian police, the number grew to around eight
tonnes in 2012.** Also the Italian authorities
seized large amounts of Albanian marijuana
on the way to the Italian coast.
Detections reported at the EU external borders mirror this development. The JO Focal
Points Land could report a strong increase in
the amount of drugs seized in Q4: at the bor-

In October, officers of the Spanish Cuerpo Nacional de Policia dismantled
three organisations that smuggled
hashish on pleasure boats from Morocco to Cadiz, Spain. The authorities
arrested 17 persons and seized 2.6 tons
of hashish, five yachts, six vehicles,
and two satellite phones.

tional weeks 46 and 47, Icelandic, Portuguese
and Italian aircraft detected three boats from
Albania carrying in total 1 980 kg of marijuana.
The largest shipment consisted of 1 610 kg of
drugs that were packed in 88 bags. Moreover,
the arrested Albanian and two Italian nationals carried an AK-47 rifle and an automatic gun
with 90 cartridges of ammunition.
Alongside increased seizures along the borders to the Western Balkans, Moroccan criminal groups continued to produce and export
substantial amounts of cannabis products.
The area along the Moroccan coast showed
to be a busy scene of illicit drug transfers. During the JO Hera in December 2012, the Spanish
Civil Guard detected a shipment of 1 200 kg of
marijuana arriving in Tenerife, transported on
an inflatable boat from Morocco. The operation resulted in the arrest of 15 Spanish and four
Moroccan nationals. This seizure was only one
in a row of other detected smuggling activities during that Joint Operation. Already during November, law-enforcement authorities
found 569 kg of hashish smuggled on a rubber boat to Gran Canaria.
On 31 October, the JO Indalo concluded its activities along the sea border between Spain and
Morocco. The operation acted as a platform for
EU interagency cooperation between Frontex,
CeCLAD-M, EFCA and Europol, and therefore
significantly enhanced the level of the border surveillance in the regards of cross-border
criminality. In October, officers deployed as a
part of the operation seized drugs with a value
of EUR 8.9 million and arrested seven persons,
coming from Spain, Morocco and Lithuania.
The smuggling of Moroccan hashish in speed
boats crossing the sea between Morocco and
the Iberian Peninsula was the most frequent
modus operandi detected during that operation.

is smuggled across Iran, Turkey and the Balkan countries. Organised criminal groups involved in the trafficking of heroin particularly
challenge the law-enforcement authorities in
the Western Balkans. Large numbers of bona
fide travellers and intensifying trade between
the EU, Western Balkan countries and Turkey
complicate effective border controls. On the
other hand, Europol reports the emergence
of Pakistani OCGs in the EU that bypass Turkey and the Balkans, shipping heroin by sea
directly or via the Arabian Peninsula or Africa
to Europe. According to the EMCDDA, however, heroin consumption has recently shown
a rather declining trend in the EU.
Frontex officers deployed in the context of
the JO Focal Points Land detected 10.1 kg of
heroin hidden under the rear seat of a Bulgarian car coming from Turkey on 15 November
2012. Heroin was also found transported on
commercial flights.
Cocaine
A large amount of the cocaine sold on the European markets is smuggled from Latin America
through West African and Maghreb countries
to Spain, from where part of the illicit loads are
forwarded to the Netherlands, which serves a
hub for distribution to other EU Member States.
The cocaine supply is currently seeing a diversification, as increasing amounts arrive at ports
of southeastern Europe and along the Black
Sea coast. Cocaine is also directly trafficked on
commercial flights from Latin America and in
sea freight containers. In October 2012, Belgian
police confiscated more than eight tonnes of
cocaine hidden in a shipment of bananas from
Ecuador, bound for Rotterdam in the Netherlands. The shipment was the largest ever detected in Belgium and had a value of around
EUR 500 million.

4.10.2. Smuggling of cigarettes
Especially at the eastern external borders of
the EU, the smuggling of cigarettes is a frequently detected illegal activity. Controls of
law-enforcement authorities at the most affected BCPs are challenged by intensive passenger traffic and increasing volumes of trade
with the EU’s eastern neighbours. Frontex
Joint Operations actively contributed to the
fight against the illicit import of tobacco products, which causes fiscal losses of around
EUR 10 billion per year in the budgets of the
EU and its Member States. Most of the detections reported within Frontex Joint Operations were made at the BCP Kapitan Andreevo
between Bulgaria and Turkey. A large part of
the 133 discovered cases consisted of smaller
amounts mainly smuggled by Bulgarian nationals, whereas only few seizures at this border section were related to large-scale and
organised contraband activities.
The current environment is conducive to the
contraband of tobacco products due to multiple reasons. Some large price differentials exist
between countries located in close geographical proximity, which creates considerable incentives for cross-border smuggling. In 2011,
a pack of cigarettes in Latvia cost five times
as much as in the Russian Federation. In Q4
2012, the land border section with the largest
number of cigarettes confiscated in context
of a Frontex JO showed to be between these
two countries. All seized cigarettes were connected to just one incident on 6 November,
when two border guards found double registration plates at two Lithuanian fuel tankers and forwarded them to the second-line
control. A closer examination led to the discovery of a false wall in one of the lorries. The
officers eventually found out that the hollow
space was filled with 4 427 600 cigarettes.
Border guards deployed at the BCPs situated
between Poland and Ukraine frequently detect
persons smuggling either smaller amounts of

42 of 62

cigarettes for personal consumption or large
shipments for resale in Poland or further transport to western Europe. In Q4, in context of
the JO Focal Points Land 2012, Frontex officers in cooperation with their Polish colleagues
seized more than two million cigarettes in 38
different smuggling incidents. Most of these
contraband inflows were discovered at the
BCP of Medyka, others along the green border, and a few in Polish private properties close
to Ukraine.
Also the border between Poland and Belarus
showed intensive smuggling activities. However, the 28 seizures were much smaller in size,
resulting in a total of 140 000 confiscated cigarettes, most of them found at the BCP of Terespol. In nine of these cases cigarettes were
hidden in the engine rooms of trains coming
from Belarus.
The final destinations of many cigarettes
smuggled across the eastern external borders into the EU are western European countries, where criminal groups can make even
better profits due to higher excise taxes on
tobacco products.
In December 2012, one case of cigarette
smuggling close to the Greek island of Crete
gained particular prominence. After having
received information on a suspicious vessel
close to the port of Chania, the Greek Coastguard stopped and searched the Moldovanregistered ‘Noah’ and found eight containers
with around 53 760 000 cigarettes. The crew
consisting of five Albanian nationals was arrested and the Egyptian-produced cigarettes
confiscated.
4.10.3. Fuel product smuggling
A slight decrease in petrol prices between Q3
and Q4 took financial pressure from commuters and regular drivers. The average difference
between a litre of Super 95 bought in the EU
countries and their respective third-coun-

try neighbour(s) decreased from EUR 0.28
to EUR 0.24 during this period. This reduction may still not be sufficient to substantially weaken the incentive for motorists to
arrange a trip across the border to countries
such as the Russian Federation or Belarus,
where fuel is around half as expensive as in
Poland, Estonia or Finland. At the beginning
of December, the Polish Border Guard discovered more than 800 litres of fuel loaded
on a private vehicle crossing the border from
Ukraine. The trafficking of petroleum products is also known to take place from Serbia
and Albania, but it tends to occur on an individual level, including smaller quantities for
own consumption or sale to acquaintances.
4.10.4. Vehicle theft
In Q4 2012, Frontex assets deployed through Joint
Operations assisted in the detection of 105 stolen vehicles. This number represents a decreasing
trend, although a large part of the 192 detections in Q3 were reported within the JO Minerva, which did not continue into Q4. As many
as 44% of the recovered cars and lorries were
stopped on the way to Ukraine, most of them
on exit at the BCPs of Medyka and Dorohusk.
In turn, 23% of the vehicles were identified on
exit to Belarus, all of which attempted to leave
the EU at the BCP Terespol. A smaller proportion of cars and lorries were found at the borders to Croatia (13%), Turkey (11%) and Serbia (7%).
Frontex JO reported the identification of vehicles that had been stolen in 16 different European countries, with Germany and Italy being
the top two origins. While border guards deployed through the JO Focal Points Land detected vehicles from Germany equally on route
to Belarus, Turkey, Ukraine and Serbia, most
cars and lorries stolen in Italy were discovered
at the border to Croatia. Moreover, cases reported in JO statistics include several cars stolen in Belgium and detected on exit to Ukraine.
Border guards deployed in the JO Focal Points
Land also prevented the transit of vehicles reg-

good level of information exchange also with
third countries.
The brand preferences of criminal groups involved in vehicle theft did not show any substantial changes. Volkswagen was the most
frequent make detected among stolen cars
during the JO Focal Points Land, while Mercedes and BMW ranked second and third. In
general, vans, medium-sized and estate cars
were the preferred choice compared to highend models. Prevalence for more average models can be explained by their higher saleability
and lower conspicuousness vis-à-vis the border authorities and their risk profiling efforts.
Incidents reported in Q4 confirm a continuing trend of a large-scale and systematic theft

of cars originating from the EU. Crime groups
utilise electronic tools to quickly gain access
to medium-sized and compact-class cars with
less sophisticated protective measures, which
are then disassembled into spare parts and
brought across the external borders. Incidents
discovered in Poland show multiple consignments of stolen cars on trailers. They were
transported from western European countries
through the Schengen area to Lithuania, from
where many of these vehicles were sold to Belarus and the Russian Federation. Polish border

4.10.5. Smuggling of weapons
Only few cases of illegally smuggled weapons
were detected through Frontex JO in Q4. Border guards deployed at the border to Croatia
reported 13 attempts to import arms into an
EU Member State, 11 of which were related to
non-lethal weapons including truncheons and
brass knuckles seized on their way to Slovenia.
According to media reports, in December
2012, the Italian authorities uncovered a large
amount of trafficked weapons on transit in

the port of Naples. The police, upon receipt
of a tip-off, searched a ship container supposedly destined for the port of Alexandria
in Egypt. The load, which was declared as
construction materials, allegedly contained
pistols, rocket-propelled grenades and other
explosive materials. Further investigations
were underway.
4.10.6. Trafficking in human beings
Q4 2012 was again marked by some significant
successes in the fight against major criminal
networks involved in the trafficking of human
beings to Europe. The Spanish Cuerpo Nacional
de Policia in the end of the year 2012 disbanded

a criminal organisation that trafficked Nigerians on pateras across the Mediterranean to
Spain. The members of the criminal group continued to exercise control over their victims after they were admitted to immigrant women
shelters for humanitarian reasons. From there,
the women were forced into prostitution in different places within Spain. The investigations
were complicated by the non-hierarchical nature of the organisation, which consisted of a
heterogeneous network of criminal groups in
different locations, each specialising in separate
operational phases, including the recruitment
of the victims, the counterfeit of documents,
the transportation to the country of destination, the exploitation of the victims and the
laundering of proceeds. Italian authorities that
conducted investigations into Nigerian human
trafficking networks confirm that the structure combined modern managerial skills, traditional cultural values and religious beliefs.

A different type of organisational structure
was revealed through the detection of a
trafficking network in October 2012, run by
Kosovo-Albanians in the southwest of Germany. Police officers in Germany, France and
Belgium simultaneously conducted raids in
numerous apartments and arrested several
suspects. The authorities targeted 22 suspects belonging to a family clan, which trafficked around 50 girls, mostly under-age and
coming from Kosovo*, to Germany, France,
Belgium and Scandinavia for the purpose
of domestic labour and sexual exploitation.
Many victims crossed the borders with false
documents or as impostors. Investigations in
these cases showed a homogenous and hierarchical structure consisting of clan-related
criminals operating across Europe. The case
exemplifies a particular necessity of international and interagency cooperation for the
disruption of human trafficking networks and
organised criminal groups that are connected
through bonds of ethnicity and kinship.

Sources and Methods
For the data concerning detections at the external borders, some of the border types are
not applicable to all FRAN Member States.
This pertains to data on all FRAN indicators
since the data are provided disaggregated
by border type. The definitions of detections
at land borders are therefore not applicable (excluding borders with non-Schengen
principalities) for Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Iceland,
Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland and
the UK. For Cyprus, the land border refers to
the Green Line demarcation with the area
not under the effective control of the government of the Republic of Cyprus. For sea
borders, the definitions are not applicable for
land-locked Member States including Austria,
the Czech Republic, Hungary, Luxembourg,
Slovakia and Switzerland.
In addition, data on detections of illegal border-crossing at land, air and sea BCPs (1B) are
not available for Iceland, Ireland and Spain
and in Greece, these detections are included
in the data for Indicator 1A. Data for Norway only includes detections of illegal border-crossing at land and sea BCPs (1B), not
between BCPs (1A).
In Italy, detections of illegal border-crossing
at sea BCPs are only reported for intra-EU
border-crossing from Greece. Data on detections of illegal border-crossing between
sea BCPs (1A) are not available for Ireland.

Data on apprehension (FRAN Indicator 2) of
facilitators is not available for Ireland. For Italy, the data are not disaggregated by border
type, but are reported as total apprehensions (not specified). Data for Italy and Norway also include the facilitation of illegal stay
and work. For Romania, the data include
land intra-EU detections on exit at the border with Hungary.
For the data concerning detections of illegal
stay (FRAN Indicator 3), data on detections
at exit are not available for Denmark, Ireland,
Italy, Spain and the UK.
Data on refusals of entry (FRAN Indicator 4)
at the external EU borders are not disaggregated by reason of refusal for Ireland and
the UK. Refusals of entry at the Spanish land
borders at Ceuta and Melilla (without the issuance of a refusal form) are reported separately and are not included in the presented
FRAN data.
The data on applications for international
protection (FRAN Indicator 5) are not disaggregated by place of application (type of
border on entry or inland applications) for
Austria, the Czech Republic and Slovenia. For
these countries, only the total number of applications is reported. For France, only asylum applications at the external borders are
reported, not inland applications. For Switzerland, requests for asylum at the Swiss
Embassies abroad are also reported and considered as inland applications in the FRAN
data. For the UK, data reported for applications at air BCPs also include applications at
sea BCPs.
