Frontex official publications fall into four main categories: risk analysis, training, operations
and research, each marked with a distinct graphic identifier. Risk analysis publications bear
a triangular symbol formed by an arrow drawing a triangle, with a dot at the centre. Metaphorically, the arrow represents the cyclical nature of risk analysis processes and its orientation towards an appropriate operational response. The triangle is a symbol of ideal proportions
and knowledge, reflecting the pursuit of factual exactness, truth and exhaustive analysis.
The dot at the centre represents the intelligence factor and the focal point where information from diverse sources converges to be processed, systematised and shared as analytical
products. Thus, Frontex risk analysis is meant to be at the centre and to form a reliable basis for its operational activities.

Executive summary
The Western Balkans has gone through rapid
and significant changes regarding irregular
migration trends following the introduction of
visa-free travel arrangements with Member
States and Schengen Associated Countries.
For example, the region has transitioned from
largely a source to mostly transit area in terms
of illegal border-crossings. More precisely, almost three quarters of all detections of illegal border-crossing in the region during 2012
was due to transiting irregular migrants en
route from Greece. The same share was less
than 10% during 2009. Overall detections of
illegal border-crossings increased by 33% in
the cases of green borders and even higher
68% in the case of detections of migrants
hiding in different means of transport (also
cargo trains). Both developments were exclusively due to transiting migrants en route
from Greece.
On the other hand, nationals from the Western Balkans were detected in greater numbers
in 2012 for variety of modi operandi involving different type of legal travel abuse, detected either during border checks or while
already in the EU. Misuse of international
protection provisions in Member States and
Schengen Associated Countries was by far
the most prevalent given that in 2012 there
were almost 33 000 or 53% more asylum applications submitted by the five visa-exempt
Western Balkans nationalities (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Serbia and
the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia)
compared to 2011. In fact, the number was
the highest since the introduction of visa –
free travel and amounted to 12% of the total
asylum intake in Member States and Schengen Associated Countries.*

Other abuses of legal travel channels were
linked to overstay in Member States and
Schengen Associated Countries. More precisely, while detections of illegal stay remained largely stable from 2009 to 2011, there
were roughly one fifth more detections of
Western Balkans nationals for illegal stay in
Member States and Schengen Associated
Countries during 2012. Increasing trend was
fairly wide spread among Member States indicating thus a general tendency.
While nationals of Serbia and Albania were
the most numerous in terms of detection for
illegal stay, the largest increase compared to
2011 was associated with persons from the
territory of Kosovo** (12% share of the total
for the Western Balkans) whose detections
for illegal stay rose by 62%. Furthermore, persons from the territory of Kosovo were detected in increasing numbers also across other
statistical indicators of irregular migration.
Noteworthy, Albanians were the most commonly detected nationality in the EU using
document fraud to illegally enter the EU/
Schengen area from a third country during 2012. Almost one fifth of all detections
were linked to this nationality, largely due to
counterfeited entry/exit stamps designed to
hide overstay.
Overall, the presented annual risk assessment,
based on the Common Integrated Risk Analysis Model suggests that the risk continues to
be the most elevated in the case of secondary movements of migrants en route from
Greece towards other Member States. This
observation is firmly corroborated also by individual assessments made by all six Western Balkan countries.

All identified risks affect both the Western
Balkan countries and Member States and are
linked to several strategic priorities identified
by the EU in its ‘EU Action on Migratory Pressures – A Strategic Response’.*
The enlargement of the EU in July 2013 (Croatia joining) will have significant border security implications for the region given the
profound changes in the length and location

of the new land external borders of the EU.
However, irregular migration trends in the
Western Balkans or linked with the region
will continue to be influenced the most by
developments at Greek and Bulgarian borders with Turkey. Therefore, the sustainability of the increased operational activity at
these border sections (the Aspida operation)
is essential in this regard.

1. Introduction
As was the case with the previous three issues, this fourth edition of the Western Balkans Annual Risk Analysis (WB-ARA) 2013 has
been prepared in cooperation between the
Risk Analysis Units of the competent border-control authorities of Albania, Bosnia and
Herzegovina (BiH), Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (fYROM), Montenegro, Serbia and the Frontex Risk Analysis
Unit (RAU).
The joint analytical activity is an integral part
of the Western Balkans Risk Analysis Network (WB-RAN) in which all the mentioned
Western Balkan countries actively participate.
The WB-ARA builds on knowledge from
previous editions of the annual report. The
analysis is structured around the following elements: (1) a description of the general context in which border controls at common

borders between Member States and Western Balkan countries occur (2) annual risk
assessment that includes identification and
description of the main risks affecting both
the area of the Western Balkans and Member States or Schengen Associated Countries,
(3) outlook, and (4) conclusions.
The statistical annex of the WB-ARA 2013
includes summary tables, describing the
six key indicators of irregular migration
in detail.
The Frontex Risk Analysis Unit would like to
thank all WB-RAN and FRAN members for
their active participation throughout 2012
and valuable input during the two Annual
Analytical Review meetings with both networks in January 2013 and the Western Balkans Expert meeting in early 2013.

2. Methodology
2.1.	Data collection plan
The core of this report are monthly statistical
data from WB-RAN and neighbouring Member States (only common borders), focused on
six key indicators of illegal migration: (1) detections of illegal border-crossing, (2) detections of facilitators, (3) detections of illegal
stay, (4) refusals of entry, (5) asylum applications, and (6) detections of false documents.
Other sources were used, in particular Frontex reporting in the context of the Post

Visa-Liberalisation Monitoring Mechanism
(PVLMM), analysis from Frontex Annual Risk
Analysis (ARA 2013), reporting and data from
the European Document Fraud Risk Analysis
Network (EDF-RAN) and Frontex reporting
from different Joint Operations coordinated
by Frontex.

2.2.	Quality of available data
Consistent with other law-enforcement indicators, variation in administrative data related
to border control depends on several factors.

In this case, the number of detections of illegal border-crossing and refusals of entry are
both functions of the amount of effort spent
detecting migrants and the flow of irregular
migrants. For example, increased detections
of illegal border-crossing might be due to an
actual increase in the flow of irregular migrants, or they may in fact be an outcome of
more resources made available to detect migrants. In exceptional cases, an influx of resources may produce an increase in reported
detections while effectively masking the actual decrease in the flow of migrants, resulting from a strong deterrent effect.

2.3.	Application of the Common
Integrated Risk Analysis
Model
In line with the previous edition of this annual report, the 2013 WB-ARA considers risk
as defined by the updated CIRAM; a function
of threat, vulnerability and impact. Such an
approach endeavours to emphasise risk analysis as a key tool in ensuring the optimal allocation of resources within constraints of
budget, staff and efficiency of equipment.

According to the model, a ‘threat’ is a force
or pressure acting upon the external borders
that is characterised by both its magnitude
and likelihood; ‘vulnerability’ is defined as the
capacity of a system to mitigate the threat
and ‘impact’ is determined as the potential
consequences of the threat. In this way, the
structured and systematic breakdown of risk
is presented in the annual risk assessment
and conclusions chapters.

2.4.	Risk assessment voting
survey
In line with the CIRAM definition of risk,
WB-RAN members were invited to provide
their input by filling in a survey regarding the
three main components of risk (threat, vulnerability and impact).
One week after the Annual Analytical Review, after internal consultation, a second
round of voting following the same modalities was carried out.
First- and second-round replies of each
WB‑RAN members were merged into a general overview and used for this analysis.

3.	The context – irregular
migration
A thorough analysis of all FRAN* and WBRAN indicators shows that, compared to 2011,
irregular migration pressure from or linked to
the Western Balkan countries increased further, progressively affecting more Member
States and Schengen Associated Countries
beyond the region itself. While there were
many interesting changes in the indicators,
this short overview only focuses on the most
important ones in terms of identified risks.

3.1.	In the Western Balkans
region
Illegal border-crossings, both between BCPs
and at BCPs (hiding in vehicles), rose in most

of the region for the second year in a row
(33% and 68% respectively compared to 2011).
By and large, the growth was linked to nonEuropean migrants travelling en route from
Greece to other Member States. Their detections for illegal border-crossings between
BCPs increased by 46%, while the same detections of nationals from the Western Balkans remained at the same level compared
to 2011. Figure 3 clearly points out the transition of the Western Balkans from a source
region to transit area for irregular migration
given that the share of Western Balkan nationals in the overall total for illegal bordercrossings between BCPs dropped from 85%
in 2010 to the current 27%.

The most affected country continued to be Serbia given that four out of ten detections were
made by this Western Balkan country. As during 2011, the border between Serbia and the
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was
under particularly high pressure (24% of the
regional total). Nevertheless, detections at
Croatia-Serbia border rose the most in relative terms (+118% compared to 2011), confirming thus the westward shift of the secondary
movements that started in late 2011. Likewise,
detections of migrants hiding in vehicles increased the most on the westward part of
the transiting routes.
As during 2011, Afghans remained the top nationality detected for illegal border-crossings
both at green borders and at BCPs, however,
Syrians and Somalis showed the highest increasing trend. To be exact, there were 2 000
Somalis detected for illegal border-crossing
between BCPs during 2012 compared to 617
during 2011. Likewise, detections of Syrians
rose 17 times compared to 2011.
Importantly, when looking into nationalities from the Western Balkans, only detections of persons from the territory of Kosovo
increased substantially compared to 2011
(+85% or 1 287).

12 of 50

3.2.	In the EU and Schengen
Associated Countries
In terms of irregular migration, by far the
most important development is associated
with the well-documented abuse of visa liberalisation process for the Western Balkan
countries.
More precisely, unfounded asylum applications by the five visa-exempt Western Balkan nationalities during 2012 rose by 53%
compared to 2011. Furthermore, the share
of the five visa-exempt nationalities in the
overall EU total (as reported in FRAN) rose
from 8% during 2011 to 12% during 2012.
At the same time, refusals of entry issued
by Member States and Schengen Associated
Countries to nationals of the Western Balkan countries fell by one fifth compared to
2011, while detections of illegal stay in Member States and Schengen Associated Countries increased by roughly the same margin
compared to 2011. This trend was quite opposite compared to the overall EU trend given
that the number of detections of illegal stay
across all Member States and Schengen Associated Countries during 2012 decreased by
almost 5% in the same year.

Document fraud detected by Member States
and Schengen Associated Countries continued to be largely driven by detections of Albanian nationals. Moreover, Albanians were
the most commonly detected nationality
for using document fraud to illegally enter
the EU/Schengen area from a third country during 2012.

3.3.	Underlying factors for the
changes in the indicators
The highlighted changes in the indicators
were influenced mostly by (a) developments
at Greek-Turkish borders, (b) continued expanding air connections of Turkish Airlines
into the Horn of Africa and West Africa (in
particular Istanbul-Mogadishu route), and
(c) limited effectiveness of measures taken
to reduce the abuse of legal travel channels
(visa liberalisation).

Developments at Greece-Turkey borders
During the first half of 2012, detections of irregular migrants at Greece-Turkey land borders continued to increase at a staggering
rate. By the end of June 2012, there were already almost 21 000 migrants detected for
illegal border-crossings or 27% more than during the same six months of 2011. Almost 60%
of all detections for illegal border-crossing in
the EU during the first half of 2012 occurred
at Greece-Turkey land border. The peak was
reached during July 2012 when more than
7 000 migrants were detected.
Greek authorities responded to the surge by
implementing operations Xenios Zeus and
Aspida (Shield) at the beginning of August
2012.
Greek authorities also accelerated building
of the fence spanning the 12.5-kilometre dry
land border stretch with Turkey from Kast-

13 of 50

Frontex · Western Balkans Annual Risk Analysis 2013

However, due to the increased operational
measures in the context of Xenios Zeus, it became more difficult to leave Greece through
intra-Schengen flights or on regular ferries
towards Italy. This is suggested by a decreasing trend for irregular migrants recorded in
the context of EDF-RAN data collection and
Frontex Operational activities (JO Poseidon
Sea and JO Aeneas).

© Frontex, FOO, January 2013

Undoubtedly, Xenios Zeus and Aspida operations in Greece were very effective in terms
of reducing the new arrivals from Turkey.
However, as a result, leaving Greece through
the Western Balkan route became an increasingly attractive alternative during the
second part of 2012.
Figure 4. Border fence between Greece and Turkey completed at the
end of 2012

anies to the Greek village of Nea Vyssa, near
the northeastern town of Orestiada (Fig. 4).
As a result, from 6 August 2012 onwards the
number of apprehensions at the Greek-Turkish land border dropped significantly. Importantly, in subsequent months the numbers
were up to ten times lower compared to the
peak during July 2012. There was less that 300
detections during the last three months of
2012 reported at this border section. Consequently, its share of the EU total fell from
roughly 60% during the second quarter of
2012 to only 2% by the end of 2012.
At the same time, the measures to counter
grey economy in Greece (part of the Xenios
Zeus operation) were compounded by severe
economic crisis and a general rise of xenophobic attacks against or harassment of migrants
there. Consequently, many migrants that were
already in Greece prior to the start of the two
operations decided to leave Greece for other
Member States or Schengen Associated Countries. This has been corroborated also by Frontex operational intelligence.

Turkish Airlines expand further into
Africa
Turkish Airlines (THY) continued to expand its
network of international destinations, mostly
in Africa. Consequently, the number of passengers carried by THY exceeded 39 million
during 2012 with most of the growth generated on international routes.
For example, during 2012, THY inaugurated
new routes to Kinshasa in the Democratic
Republic of Congo, Nouakchott in Mauritania and Mogadishu (via Khartoum) in Somalia.
THY became the first international airline to
fly to Mogadishu after two decades of conflict in this Horn of Africa nation. With the
new route starting, issues related to document fraud (look-alike method) or student
visa abuses were increasingly mentioned. In
one reported case, three high-ranking officials have been arrested for mismanaging
one scholarship scheme that sends Somali
students to Turkey. The officials were arrested for offering the scholarships to undeserving students.

Measures to counter the abuse of visa-free travel channel: the case of the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
Operational measures
n	Strengthened exit controls: check of necessary financial means, conducting interviews in reference to their destination, the purpose and the motives for the travel.
Public awareness campaigns
The project ‘No more abuse of the visa-liberalisation’ gives priority to educational meetings in the relevant municipalities. The activities include:
n	Educational workshops and meetings with local communities;
n	Advisory groups of citizens;
n	Public tribunes;
n	Meetings with Non-Governmental Orga­nisations;
n	Meetings with the local councils for prevention of abuse of visa-free regime;
n	More than of 10 000 leaflets in all languages with detailed information on visa-free
regime were distributed during such meetings.
Legislative measures
The Law amending the Criminal Code of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
was adopted at the end of 2011. The law provides for a new criminal offence: ‘Abuse of
the visa-free regime with the Member States of the European Union and of the Schengen Agreement’. The amendments foresee that ‘any person who recruits, encourages,
organises, harbours or transports persons into a Member State of the European Union
and the Schengen Agreement, for the purpose of obtaining or exercising social, economic
or other rights, contrary to the law of the European Union, regulations of the Member
States of the European Union and to the Schengen Agreement and international law,
shall be punished with imprisonment of at least four years’. Liability of legal entities that
provide transportation in such cases is also foreseen (transportation means used for
committing the offence are confiscated).
Likewise, amendments of the Law on Travel Documents allow for passport to be
confiscated for a period of one year if the person in question is forcibly returned
from another country.

While the arrests demonstrated the commitment of the new authorities in Mogadishu to
fight corruption, they also pointed to a major vulnerability in the Turkish student visa
scheme allowing many Somalis to abuse it.

Furthermore, ever since the last three months
of 2012, there has been a steady increase of
illegal border-crossings by African country
nationals at the land border between Bulgaria and Turkey. Relative share of this group

15 of 50

Frontex · Western Balkans Annual Risk Analysis 2013

of irregular migrants was only 15% in January
2012, however, it rose to about 50% in January and February 2013.
In conclusion, THY expansion into Africa
makes travelling to Turkey increasingly easy
and cheap for those Africans who travel with
the intention to subsequently enter the EU
irregularly and continue further through the
Western Balkans.
Limited effectiveness of measures
taken to reduce the abuse of legal travel
channels (visa liberalisation)
All five visa-exempt Western Balkan nationalities have demonstrated additional com-

16 of 50

mitment during 2012 to further reduce the
extent of asylum abuse associated with the
visa liberalisation. As shown by the case of
the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (see box) the set of measures include
those at borders, inland and related to legislation. These or very similar measures are
also implemented in the other four visa-exempt countries.
Still, the asylum abuse by the five nationalities in the EU and Schengen Associated Countries increased to unprecedented levels during
2012 pointing thus to somewhat limited impact of the regional efforts against the abuse.

4. Annual risk assessment
As introduced in the previous annual analysis
(WB-ARA 2012), the annual risk assessment
is guided by the CIRAM working definition
of risk as a function of three main components: threat, vulnerability and impact.* It
largely builds on the main findings from the
same exercise last year.
This chapter is meant to inform coordinated
planning and strategic decisions at the highest policy level in the Western Balkans and
the EU.
It draws heavily from a detailed analysis of
the available monthly statistical data (FRAN,
WB-RAN and EDF-RAN), Frontex operational data and bi-monthly or quarterly analytical reports provided by both FRAN and
WB-RAN members. In addition, it also takes
into account the outcome of the Annual Analytical Review workshop with Member State
and Schengen Associated Country analysts
and a similar workshop with WB-RAN countries (both events occurred in January 2013).
Each identified risk is described in detail, broken down by its main components. A summary risk table at the beginning of each
detailed description is added allowing for a
rapid understanding of the issues at stake.
The following three main risks and five specific threats are considered in this assessment:
1.	Risk of large and sustained secondary
movements from Greece through the
Western Balkans

n	Illegal border-crossing at green borders
n	Clandestine entries through BCPs
2.	Risk of large and sustained abuse of legal travel channels by nationals from the
Western Balkans countries
n	Asylum misuse
n	Illegal stay in Member States
n	Document fraud
3.	Risk of increased of smuggling of stolen
vehicles, drugs and weapons across the
common borders;
The list is somewhat different compared to
the one in the last year’s report since it does
not contain descriptions of risks associated
with irregular migration of Turkish nationals
through the Western Balkans towards the EU
and misuse of international protection in the
Western Balkans region itself. The reasons
for this choice are simple: compared to 2011,
all relevant indicators suggest that irregular
migration of Turkish nationals through the
Western Balkans decreased, reducing the
level of risk accordingly.

* According to the CIRAM
model, a ‘threat’ is a force
or pressure acting upon
the external borders that
is characterised by both its
magnitude and likelihood;
‘vulnerability’ is defined as
the capacity of a system
to mitigate the threat and
‘impact’ is determined as
the consequences of the
threat.

In the case of asylum misuse, while the risk
remained elevated, claiming asylum and absconding afterwards continued to be done
in a very similar and well documented (in
WB-ARA 2012 and WB-ARA 2011) fashion as a
specific modus operandi inevitably linked to the
risk of secondary movements from Greece.

4.1.1. Description of the threat
As during previous years, Greece is often not
considered as the final destination for irregular migrants that enter the EU through
Greece-Turkey borders. Most plan to travel
to other Member States or Schengen Associated Countries, either immediately or after
sufficient means are raised to finance their

onward journey. In essence, migrants have
three main options to exit Greece and reach
other Member States: (a) by air on an intraSchengen flight, (b) by sea on an intra-Schengen ferry to Italy or (c) by land, either through
the Western Balkans or Bulgaria.
Unsurprisingly, the Western Balkans is now
for the second year running mostly tran-

quarters (73%) of all illegal border-crossings
(or 25 554 cases) reported by WB-RAN countries and the neighbouring Member States
during 2012 was associated with this group
(see Fig. 5).

Therefore, the Western Balkan route remained largely a function of the transiting
flow through the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Serbia, Albania, Montenegro and Croatia.

Frontex · Western Balkans Annual Risk Analysis 2013

Illegal border-crossing between BCPs
There were almost 35 000 detections of illegal border-crossing between BCPs reported
by Western Balkan countries and their neighbouring Member States during 2012 (common
and regional borders). The number was 33%
higher compared to 2011. Serbia was by far
the top reporting country in the region with
40% share, followed by Croatia (18% share).
It is notable that Serbia detected slightly
more illegal border-crossings between BCPs
than Italy (ranked second in the EU total) and
more than double compared to Spain (ranked
third in the EU total) during 2012. Furthermore, detections in Croatia and Serbia during the fourth quarter of 2012 were higher
than in any Member States or Schengen Associated Countries, including Greece.
Most of the mentioned 33% annual growth
was linked to secondary movements of Afghans, Pakistanis, Algerians, Somalis, Syrians and Moroccans en route from Greece to
other Member States. By and large detections
occurred at Serbia’s borders with the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, where the
smuggling of migrants is believed to be increasingly organised.
This trend of increased reliance on facilitation services (vs self-organised with simple
instructions, maps and directions) on the
main routing through Serbia started already
at the end of 2011.
Westward shift intensified during 2012
The growth of detections at the CroatiaSlovenia and Serbia-Croatia borders (double the number compared to 2011) appears to
be confirming a westward shift in the routing, already detected at the end of 2011. In
fact, irregular migrants were increasingly attempting to cross from Serbia to Croatia and
further to Slovenia rather than to Hungary.

20 of 50

Detections at Romania-Serbia border showed
an annual increase of 63%, however, the flow
there started to decline during the last three
months of 2012.
Nationalities
Despite relatively stable trend, Afghans remained the largest nationality with more
than 8 000 detections. The number of detected Syrians continued to increase strongly
during the last quarter of 2012. In fact, there
were 1 646 Syrians detected for illegal-border-crossing compared to only 92 during 2011.
By the end of 2012, nationals of Eritrea were
the fastest growing group of migrants: their
number rose from only 20 in the third quarter
to more than 300 during the fourth quarter.
Similarly nationals of Mali grew from only three
in the third quarter to 78 in the fourth quarter.
Importantly, more Pakistanis were detected
in the Western Balkans compared to GreeceTurkey borders, where Aspida operation led to
significant decrease in 2012 (see Fig. 9). This
in turn indicates that nationals from Pakistan
who were staying illegally in Greece for some
time before Aspida and Xenios Zeus operations (up to several years in some cases) were
increasingly deciding to leave Greece through
the Western Balkans.
Hiding in vehicles
Importantly, detections of migrants hiding in
vehicles continued to increase in 2012. There
were 1 667 (an 87% increase compared to
2011) migrants detected in vehicles at different regional BCPs while trying to clandestinely avoid border checks.
As in the case of green border crossings, Serbia detected by far the most persons hidden
in transport means (50% share of total), followed by Croatia and Slovenia. Most were
detected through extensive use of techni-

cal means (CO2 detectors) Importantly, detections of migrants hidden in vehicles at
the border between Serbia and Croatia rose
by a massive 240%, thus indicating further
previously mentioned westward shift in the
routing.

Afghans were the top nationality with one
third of all detections. Similarly to illegal border-crossings between BCPs, the number of
Syrians grew strongly mostly during the last
three months of 2012.

to cross regional or common borders during 2012, the increase being by far the most

Increased reliance on facilitation services
The described trends continue to suggest
that more migrants en route from Greece
are opting for crossing the regional and
common borders hidden in vehicles and are
therefore relying on more sophisticated facilitation/smuggling services. This modus op-

22 of 50

erandi, however , contains a high risk of loss
of life, especially when closed hidden compartments are used in cars, buses, trains
and containers.
The increased reliance on facilitation was
well demonstrated by a recent (January 2013)
pan-European case in which more than 100

Variations in modi operandi and use of
cargo trains

The migrants were often smuggled in inhuman and dangerous conditions, such as
in very small hidden compartments in the
floor of buses or trucks, in freight trains or
on boats. In some cases falsified travel documents were used by the migrants. Marriages
of convenience were also used as a modus
operandi to regularise their status in the EU.

In some reported cases irregular migrants
have been placed onto railway carriages of
trains with international routes that depart
from Greece. Abuse of customs stamps and
seals was used to illegally transport these
persons from Greece to other Member States
via the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Serbia and Hungary.

This was one of the largest Europol co-ordinated investigations against people smugglers, involving more than 1200 police officers.

Main organisers/facilitators continue to be
Afghan or Pakistani nationals with many local associates (e.g. drivers, providers of safe
houses or guides).

All arrested persons were suspected of being involved in smuggling of a large number of irregular migrants both into and
within the EU mainly via the Western Balkan region.

According to information provided by Western Balkan countries and several Member
States, there was a considerable variation in
modi operandi according to:
n	
Points of departure and the level of facilitation provided: migrants either started
directly from Turkey and travelled through
the Western Balkans without stopping (full
package) or opted for several stops in the
Western Balkans (cheaper but longer).
n	
Types of vehicles used: migrants continued to use all available transport means
ranging from public buses, cars, lorries and
cargo or passenger trains. The novel development is linked to transport of lorries
on railway (cargo trains, see box)
n Level of organisation and planning: migrants were either boarding lorries or
trains without the knowledge of drivers
or were provided with sophisticated package that included front vehicles to alert
against possible police controls inland.

Figure 12. Migrants hiding in cargo train,
detected by Serbian authorities during 2012

persons were arrested on suspicion of being
part of a people-smuggling facilitation network. Suspects were arrested in Croatia, the
Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece,
Hungary, Poland, Slovak Republic, Turkey and
Kosovo region.

ity in 2012 given that their numbers rose to
nearly 22 424 applications (less than 9 000
applications in 2011). Nevertheless, almost
33 000 asylum seekers from the five visaexempt Western Balkan countries (Albania,
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Montenegro) during 2012 contributed the most
to the overall increase in the EU.
In fact, the number of asylum applications by
the mentioned five Western Balkan nationalities during 2012 was 53% higher compared
to 2011 and the largest recorded so far in the
context of Frontex Post Visa-Liberalisation
Monitoring Mechanism (PVLMM). Furthermore, the share of the five visa-exempt nationalities in the overall EU total (as reported
in FRAN) rose from 8% during 2011 to 12% during 2012 (see Fig. 11).
Serbian nationals continued to be the single largest visa-exempt nationality claiming asylum in the EU during 2012. With more

the five Western Balkan nationalities

than 15 900, or 6% of total asylum intake in
the EU in 2012, Serbs were also the fourthranked nationality (after Afghans, Syrians
and Russians) of asylum applicants in the EU.
Combined, asylum applications from the five
visa-exempt Western Balkan nationalities
amounted to roughly 97% of all asylum applications submitted by all visa-free nationalities (see Fig. 12).
Distribution of asylum applications by
Member States and Schengen Associated
Countries
As indicated by the Figure 13, most Member States and Schengen Associated Countries reported various degrees of increases.
It has to be stressed, however, that apart
from Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, Belgium
and Luxembourg (top five Member States
and Schengen Associated Countries), asylum applications remained fairly modest in
other Member States and Schengen Associated Countries. Namely, the top five Member
States and Schengen Associated Countries
handled nine out of ten asylum applications
from the mentioned five Western Balkan nationalities (around 29 000).In Germany alone,
15 700 applications were submitted or 154%
more compared to 2011. Sweden handled
7 175 cases, roughly one fifth more than the
year before, while in Switzerland the numbers rose by 50% to 3 706.
Luxembourg remained slightly below the
2011 levels (1 445) and Belgium was the only
among the five countries to report a significant decreasing trend (-38%) compared to 2011
The UK and Denmark were the only other
two Member States with more that 500 asylum applications from the five visa-exempt
nationalities. They both reported significant
increasing trends; 118% in the case of the UK
and 242% in the case of Denmark (from 173
in 2011 to 591 in 2012). These two Member
States were targeted almost exclusively by

Ethnic background of asylum seekers
As during 2011, available data suggests
that majority of all asylum seekers from
the Western Balkans were of Roma ethnic background. In Germany, for example, more than 80% of all applicants were
Roma. In the case of Sweden, the percentage was similar, however, the authorities conducted a study during the
autumn 2012 peak period to re-examine
the prevailing ethnic profile of asylum
applicants from the Western Balkans.
Sweden determines the ethnicity of applicants on the basis of their declared
mother tongue. Thus, if the applicant
claimed the Romani language as the
mother tongue, then he or she was automatically listed as having Roma ethnic background.
However, the study showed that there
were probably even more Roma people
among the asylum seekers in Sweden
than previously believed. The reason is
that many Roma also speak languages
other than Romani (e.g. Serbian) and that
they can state another language as
their mother tongue.

Asylum recognition rates in Member States
and Schengen Associated Countries for the
applicants of the five visa-exempt nationalities were generally below 1%. In the case
of Germany they were as low as 0.2% for
Serbian nationals. This in turn continues to
indicate largely unfounded nature of these
asylum claims.
Distribution of asylum applications by
Western Balkan nationalities
All five visa-exempt Western Balkan nationalities submitted more asylum applications

26 of 50

during 2012 compared to 2011. The increases
ranged from 38% in the case of Serbia to 128%
in the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Unsurprisingly, Serbian nationals remained by far
the top nationality with more than 15 900 applications or 48% share of the total. Compared
to 2011, share of Serb applications in the total fell by 10 percentage points, largely due to
substantial increasing trend associated with
nationals of Albania and Bosnia-Herzegovina.
Germany was by far the most preferred destination. Apart from Albanians, all other four
visa-exempt nationalities submitted most of
their applications in this Member State. In
fact, in the case of nationals from Serbia, the
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and

Germany and has started to gather pace in
mid-July 2012 when Sweden was replaced by
Germany as the Member State with the highest number of asylum applications from the
five visa-exempt Western Balkan nationalities. Switzerland, on the other hand, started
to report significantly lower numbers after
August 2012 after a period of three months
of constant increases.
The peak in Germany was probably linked
with the German Constitutional Court’s Decision of July 2012, which stipulated that the
benefits afforded for asylum applicants should
increase and in part be disbursed in cash.
Similarly, the drop in Switzerland at the beginning of August 2012 was associated with
the introduction of several measures by the
Swiss Federal Office for Migration (FOM).
More precisely, FOM introduced a fast-track
procedure for all visa-exempt European countries, allowing decision on merits to be taken
within 48 hours. In addition, the set of new
measures included:
n	A preliminary interview where a potential
applicant is briefed about negative consequences of an unfounded asylum application (before a formal application is
submitted);
n	Cancellation of all forms of return assistance for failed asylum seekers from visa-

28 of 50

exempt European countries. This measure
has been in place since April 2012; however, from the beginning of August 2012
not even travel allowances were granted
anymore;
n	A re-entry ban (SIS alert of five years)
to be issued to all failed asylum seekers
who do not cooperate with the FOM, refuse to leave or make multiple unjustified
applications.
New developments
Rumour-based surges – the case of Albania
and Bosnia-Herzegovina

Albanians became the top nationality applying for asylum in Sweden during April-May
2012 period, an unprecedented development
since the PVLMM reporting began. The trend
was very similar to the October-November
2011 peak in Belgium, when asylum applications made by Albanian nationals increased
significantly, only to decrease rapidly soon
afterwards (see Fig. 17).
In line with this observation, the increasing
trend was spurred by rumours that Sweden would accept asylum applications for
economic reasons. The exponential growth
prompted the Swedish authorities to take
immediate action (see box).

Importantly, by the end of May 2012, Albanian asylum applications had dropped back
to the pre-peak levels. This sudden increase
followed by the equally sudden decrease is an
additional indication that an immediate reaction by authorities is the key to mitigation
when rumours are the primary reason behind
a surge (similarly to developments in Belgium
during the October-November 2011 peak).
After the May 2012 surge of Albanian applications, Sweden again reported a very similar
increasing trend during June 2012, this time
due to applications filed by nationals from
Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Increase of exit refusals and a drop in
refusals of entry to the EU
All Western Balkan countries took additional
measures at their borders in order to prevent
possible abuses of visa-free travel arrangements resulting in an increase in exit refusals. Most were refused exit because they were
unable to justify the purpose of their travel
or were previously deported from EU/Schengen countries.

Authorities react immediately to the surge in Sweden

Unlike most of applicants from Bosnia and
Herzegovina before, persons involved in this
particular surge had a more long-term strategy for trying to stay in Sweden. According
to the Swedish authorities, many of them
allegedly sold their property believing they
have a real chance of obtaining residence
permits in Sweden.

Swedish consular authorities in Albania issued a strong public statement warning all those intending to misuse visa-free
travel for claiming asylum in Sweden that their applications
for economic reasons would be swiftly rejected. All such individuals would be issued a re-entry ban and, subsequently, entered into the Schengen Information System (SIS alert). Such
ban would prevent them from legal travel to the Schengen
area for at least five years.

The asylum abuse issue during June-July 2012
peak remained quite localised. Many of the
asylum seekers in Sweden originated from
north-eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina, close
to the border with Serbia.

Consequently, the Swedish authorities reported a decrease
in Albanian asylum applications at Arlanda airport during the
second half of May 2012. The authorities there also stated
that most of the applicants were later flying on the route
from Podgorica in Montenegro to Arlanda via Istanbul
using Turkish Airlines for the whole trip.

alities whose detections for illegal stay in
Member States increased the most. More
precisely, during 2012 there were almost 22%
more illegal stayers from the Western Balkans
detected in the EU compared to 2011. This
trend was quite the opposite to the overall
EU trend given that the number of detections
of illegal stay across all Member States and
Schengen Associated Countries decreased by
almost 5% during 2012 (see Fig. 20).
Distribution by Member States
and Schengen Associated Countries
More than half of all illegal stayers from the
Western Balkans were detected by only four
Member States: Germany, Greece, Slovenia
and Italy. Apart from Slovenia, all other top
ten Member States and Schengen Associated Countries all reported increasing numbers compared to 2011. Germany became the
top reporting country given that detections
there rose by 59% compared to 2011. The trend
was by and large linked to persons from the
territory of Kosovo and to lesser extent also
from Serbia. Hungary, however, reported the
single largest relative increase of 92%, largely
due to Serbian nationals.

alisation could lead to diversification of migratory choices made by would-be illegal
migrants from Albania.
Serbian nationals were detected for illegal
stay predominantly by Germany and Hungary. In both Member States detections rose
by 42% and 87%, respectively. Elsewhere in
the EU, Illegal stay detections of Serb nationals either decreased or remained largely
at 2011 levels.
By far the largest increase compared to 2011
was associated with persons from the territory of Kosovo (12% share of the total for the
Western Balkans) whose detections for illegal stay rose by 62%. The increase was despite the fact that Kosovo is the only territory
in the Western Balkans for which Member
States and Schengen Associated Countries
still request visas. Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Belgium were affected the most.
4.2.3. Document fraud
Document fraud in the Western Balkans is
linked to three separate phenomena. The

32 of 50

first and by far the largest is associated with
attempts to cover up overstay and thus
avoid SIS entry bans. The second is linked
to persons from the territory of Kosovo trying to circumvent visa obligation through
many diverse modi operandi while the last
one is a function of secondary movements
of migrants en route from Greece to other
Member States and Schengen Associated
Countries.
Detections in Member States and
Schengen Associated Countries:
EU perspective
According to EDF-RAN data, in 2012 there
were nearly 8 000 detections of migrants
using fraudulent documents to illegally enter
the EU/Schengen area from third countries,
which is a substantial increase compared to
previous years. Much of this increase was due
to higher pressure at the external border in
terms of migrants using, inter alia, counterfeit
stamps or forged passports to illegally enter

European Union Document-Fraud
Risk Analysis Network
Despite the recognised seriousness of
document fraud, until recently there
was no regular or consolidated information exchange among Member States
and there were no overall analyses of
trends in the field of document fraud at
the EU level. To address this information
gap and following on from the success
of an earlier pilot study, the European
Union Document-Fraud Risk Analysis Network (EDF-RAN) was formed
in early 2012 to serve as a platform
for information exchange among
Member States.

© ifado.consilium.eruopa.eu

from third countries. However, at least some
of the increase should probably be attributed
to a gradually increased focus on consistent,
well-defined reporting within the framework
of the EDF-RAN and changes in reporting
practise from 2011 to 2012.
Albanians were the most commonly detected
for using document fraud to illegally enter the
EU/Schengen area from a third country during
2012. Almost one fifth of all detections were
linked to this nationality. The other top five
nationalities were Syrian, Moroccan, Ukrainian and Nigerian.
In previous years, most detections were made
at the major EU airports, but in 2012 there
were more detections at the external land
(56%) than at both the air (39%) and sea borders (5%). The reason for the switch was a
massive increase in the number of Albanian
nationals detected at land border between
Greece and Albania, using counterfeit border-crossing stamps (see Fig. 22) to fabricate
travel histories and thus attempt to extend
periods of stay.
Out of almost 2 000 reported cases of counterfeited stamps, roughly 83% were Greek
stamps and the rest predominantly Albanian
(335). This trend, involving mostly circular migrants, would have begun in 2011 once Albanians nationals were granted visa-free access
to the Schengen area.
Albanians were also increasingly detected
travelling from the Schengen area to the UK
and to a lesser extent to Ireland.
Detections in the Western Balkans:
WB‑RAN perspective
Document fraud detections by the six
WB-RAN members during 2012 remained
largely at levels observed in 2011. More precisely, there were 558 detections of document fraud during 2012 compared to 549

Figure 22. In 2012, counterfeit Greek bordercrossing stamps (entry and exit) were the
most commonly abused document on entry
to the EU/Schengen area from third countries,
almost exclusively used by Albanian migrants
entering Greece

during 2011. The stable trend, however, hides
significant divergence in terms of reporting
country, type of documents and the main
nationalities.
Reporting country, border sections

Almost 40% of all detections of document
fraud in the Western Balkans region was reported by Albania only, followed by Croatia
and Serbia (25% and 14% shares, respectively).
With 60% increase compared to 2011, detections in Albania demonstrated by far the most
pronounced upward trend. It was largely due
to detections of Albanian nationals with counterfeited Greek border-crossing stamps. In
fact, almost 100% detections at the GreekAlbanian border was linked to this type of
fraud designed to hide overstay in Greece
(more than three months in any given six
months period) and thus mirroring previously
described detections in Greece.
Albanian authorities were able to detect most
of the fraudsters by checking entry/exit electronic data with the stamps.
Consequently, the mentioned border section
was the number one in the region, followed
by detections at Albanian sea border (ferries

coming from the territory of Kosovo, followed by nationals of Turkey and Albania.

Passports
While counterfeited entry/exit stamps were
the highest growing form of fraud, passports
remained the most abused with almost half
of the overall share in 2012. Document fraud
involving passports during 2012 remained
largely at 2011 levels with almost identical
number of detected cases (254 in 2012 vs
245 in 2011).

There was a high degree of specialisation associated with passport abuse. Namely, by and
large most nationalities abuse their own national passports. The only notable exception
to this rule were passport fraudsters from the
territory of Kosovo who were detected with
a wide variety of passports from the region
itself (mostly Albanian) and several Member
States (Bulgaria, Slovenia, Greece, Czech Republic, Germany, Austria).

Most of passport abuse involved Albanian
travel documents (61), followed by those
from Bulgaria (49) and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (24). In terms
of passport fraudsters, most of them were

Interestingly, WB-RAN data do not suggest
any noticeable national detection bias.* More
precisely, most fraudulent Albanian passports
were detected by Croatia and not Albania.
Likewise, passports from the former Yugo-

slav Republic of Macedonia were detected
more often by Albania and Serbia.
Residence permits
Detections of document fraud involving residence permits of different Member States
and Schengen Associated Countries were
also detected in fairly similar numbers as
during 2011. There were roughly 100 detection cases, involving mostly Swiss (36),
German (18), Greek (9), Italian (7) and Slovenian (7) fraudulent residence permits. In fact,
residence permits from these five Member
States and Schengen Associated Countries
amounted to 80% share of the total detections during 2012.
As in the case of passport abuse, persons
from the territory of Kosovo were detected
in significant numbers. To be exact, almost
70% or 66 cases of residence permit abuse
were linked to this group of illegal migrants.
Their preference was clearly for Swiss residence permits (32), followed by German (15)
and Slovenian (7).
More than half of all detections for residence
permits was done by Albania alone, either at
their sea borders (ferries to Italy) or at their air
border. All detections were during exit controls when persons (mostly from Kosovo) tried

to leave Albania and enter Schengen area. Interestingly, Albania was also able to detect
four cases of migrants from Syria, Pakistan
and Mali trying to leave Albania on ferries to
Italy by using counterfeited residence permits
from Bulgaria, Greece and France. This in turn
clearly indicates that migrants en route from
Greece to other Member States are expanding their options for secondary movements
through the Western Balkans.
Identity cards
All WB-RAN members accept identity cards
issued by Member States and Schengen Associated Countries as valid travel documents
for entering or exiting their territory. Relatively high number of detections of this type
of documents is therefore not surprising. In
fact, detections (85) rose by 30% during 2012,
largely due to Albanian nationals trying to
exit Albania using Italian identity cards. In
addition, more Turkish nationals were trying
to use Bulgarian identity cards to exit Croatia and enter the Schengen area in Slovenia.
More than three quarter of all detections
were linked to ID cards from only six Member States: Italy (mostly Albanians), Greece
(mostly Syrians), Bulgaria (mostly Turks),
Spain (Bolivians), Romania (Tajiks) and Belgium (Kosovo).

Smuggling of drugs, vehicles and weapons across the Western Balkan borders

Main border sections

4.3.1. Description of the threat
According to information gathered during JO
Focal Points Land and JO Aeneas in 2012, the
largest share of cross-border criminality at different Western Balkan borders relates to drug
trafficking to the Member States and smuggling of stolen vehicles on exit from the EU.
The smuggling of weapons has been reported
less frequently, but should still be considered
as a threat. In comparison with the Eastern
Borders, the number of illicitly imported cigarettes detected during Frontex Joint Operations was rather low.
Stolen vehicles on exit from the EU
Compared to 2011, the overall number of stolen vehicles detected through JO Focal Points
Land rose by 50%. While 369 vehicles at the
external borders were found to be stolen
in 2011, the number of related incidents in
2012 amounted to 512. This trend was mainly
caused by 55% more detections at the Eastern Borders, but also assets deployed through
Frontex at the Western Balkans registered an
increase of almost one third in the number
of stolen vehicles.
Thus in 2012, the second most important destination region for stolen cars and other machinery stolen from the EU shows to be the
Western Balkans again.
Most of the identified cars on their way to the
Western Balkan countries were reported as
stolen in Italy, Germany and Slovenia.

36 of 50

Many crime groups organise the theft of vehicles on the basis of specific orders placed
by potential buyers in their countries of origin, specifying the demanded type of the car.
Particularly often detected car makes at the
EU external borders in 2012 were Volkswagen
with 33%, BMW with 28% and Audi with 25%.
In comparison with Eastern Borders, Mercedes Benz was rather underrepresented
with only 14% of detections. Border guards
deployed in JO Focal Points Land also seized
vehicles registered as stolen by the authorities of Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina,
which shows an improved information exchange with these third countries.
Smuggling of drugs
According to Europol, the heroin smuggling
routes to Europe have diversified in recent
years, but the information available to Frontex shows that the Western Balkans Route is
still used for the transport of the substance
into Europe on a regular basis.
In 2012, border guards in cooperation with local customs officers detected a total amount
of 86 kg of heroin through Frontex Joint Operations in Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary and Slovenia. Most seizures were related to single
travellers who concealed smaller amounts
on their bodies or in cavities of their cars.
Other detections, however, showed the reappearance of larger scale heroin shipments
along the Balkan route – a phenomenon that
seemed to decrease during 2011.

At the beginning of August 2012, 21.8 kg of
heroin were found in the tank of a Bosnian
lorry during the JO Focal Points Land at the
BCP Kapitan Andreevo. In November, border
guards deployed under the JO Focal Points
Land searched a car crossing the border from
Turkey to Bulgaria and found 10.8 kg of heroin packed in 21 bags under the rear seats of
the vehicle.
After entering Bulgaria and Greece from Turkey, heroin is shipped through various transit countries towards Western Europe. Facts
gathered through the Western Balkans Risk
Analysis Network show heroin seizures on
the way from Greece to Albania and further
on at the borders to Montenegro and Croatia.

According to Europol, Turkish OCGs play a
strong role for the shipment of heroin to Europe, but they rely on the support of OCGs
native in countries through which the substance transits, such as Serbian and Albanian
groups. Storage facilities for heroin continue
to exist in Albania, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Kosovo. Member
States also reported migrant workers returning to the EU, who transported smaller
portions of heroin in busses or their private
cars through the Western Balkan countries.
Also cannabis products are systematically
smuggled from and through the Western Balkans. In 2012, 657 kg of marijuana was seized
through Frontex Joint Operations at the bor-

The largest related shipment was detected

Even though Albanian law enforcement
managed to destroy production capacities
in many rural areas, cannabis from Albania
is again reported in large amounts, mainly
smuggled to Greece, Italy and Macedonia.
While in 2011 around 3.7 tonnes of canna-

38 of 50

bis herb was seized by Albanian border police, the number grew to around 10 tonnes
in 2012. Also Greek and Italian authorities
reported large seizures of cannabis originating from Albania. Within the JO Aeneas
2012, several boats were detected on their
way to Italy carrying a total of 1 980 kg of
marijuana. South East Europe is also a region
of growing significance for cocaine smuggling from Latin America. According to Europol, particularly Croatia is used as an entry
point for cocaine, which is mainly smuggled
in sea containers.

Smuggling of weapons

A continued flow of illicit small arms can be
expected from the Western Balkan countries, where a large number of weapons are
stored in private households. Greek sources
report that rifles used by organised crime
groups in many cases come from neighbouring Albania and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.

© Hellenic Coast Guard

The rather sporadic information received
through Frontex Joint Operations on trafficking in small arms across the Western Balkan borders does not give a comprehensive
picture on the overall situation and leave a
substantial knowledge gap. However, individual incidents suggest certain geographically
related threats and vulnerabilities. During JO
Focal Points Land 2012, small firearms, ammunition and gun powder have been seized
in 10 incidents, most of them at the borders
to Croatia and Serbia. Nonlethal weapons
such as truncheons and knuckle-dusters have
been confiscated in 60 cases.

5. Outlook
5.1.	Croatia joining the EU in
July 2013
Accession negotiations with Croatia were
closed in June 2011. After the European Commission’s favourable opinion, the European
Parliament’s assent and the Council decision on the admission of Croatia, the Accession Treaty was signed on 9 December 2011.
Croatia has ratified the Accession Treaty and
will become a Member of the EU on 1 July
2013, subject to the Accession Treaty being
ratified by all Members States.

from the European
Commission to the
European Parliament and
the Council, Monitoring
Report on Croatia’s
accession preparations,
Brussels, 26 3 2013, COM
(2013) 171 Final

According to the main findings of the Communication from the European Commission
to the European Parliament and the Council Monitoring Report on Croatia’s Accession
Preparations of 26 March 2013*, preparations in the area of migration will be soon
completed.
With regard to external borders and Schengen, legislative alignment is almost complete.
The State Border Control Act and its implementing legislation were amended at the
end of 2011. The Integrated Border Management (IBM) Action Plan was revised in February 2013 and a new one is being prepared
in view of aligning the national concept with
the EU one.
Change in the physical drawing of the
external borders
Three characteristics make the Croatian land
border a real challenge for control. Firstly, it is
a very long border, stretching over 2 381 km.
Secondly, the regular traffic at the land borders is quite significant; more than 50 million crossings (entry/exit) at the border with
Slovenia alone during 2012. Thirdly, the Cro-

40 of 50

atian international borders, except the one
with Hungary, were established quite recently
over an intricate road network built without
border considerations at the time of the Yugoslav Republic.
With Croatia joining the EU, the external land
border of Member States of the EU will shift
from the land border between Slovenia and
Croatia (695 km) and Hungary and Croatia
(355 km) to the land border between Croatia
and Serbia (325 km), Croatia and Bosnia and
Herzegovina (1 001 km) and Croatia and Montenegro (22 km), resulting in a net increase of
327 km. Combined, the borders between Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro total approximately 1 377 km. Therefore,
Croatia will be the Member State with the
longest external land border, slightly longer
than Finland (1 340 km) and Greece (1 248 km).
The border section between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina (1 001 km) will be the
second longest land border section, after the
land border between Finland and the Russian
Federation (1 340 km). This long border section crosses very diverse terrain, from small
mountain ranges to urban areas.
Among all Croatian land border sections, the
border between Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina is probably the most challenging for
prevention of illegal border-crossing because
of its length, many crossing roads and links
between organised crime groups on both
sides of the border.
Although Croatia has a long coastline
(approx. 950 km), dotted with a large number of islands and many seaports, the changes
for the external sea borders will be confined
to the Adriatic Sea.

Figure 27. Changes of the external borders of the EU after Croatia becomes a full member

Croatia is not yet joining the Schengen area
and border control will continue to operate
between Croatia and Slovenia. Therefore,
Croatia’s EU membership will only have moderate impact on the main routes used by irregular migrants.

5.2.	Visa safeguard clause
instrument
The proposal for the so-called visa safeguard clause (amending Council Regulation
(EC) No 539/2001) is not only about adding
the safeguard clause which should allow for
a rapid, temporary suspension of the visa
waiver for a third country in case of an emergency situation. It also aims at:
n	modifying certain provisions, e.g. of the
reciprocity mechanism, in order to have

them fully comply with the respective
provisions of the TFEU;
n	ensuring compliance with Council Regulation (EC) No 810/2009 establishing a
Community Code on visas (Visa Code)
applicable since 5 April 2010 by providing
e.g. for appropriate definitions concerning short stay and visa;
n	ensuring that, in accordance with Article
77(2)(a) of the TFEU, the Regulation determines exhaustively whether a third-country national is to be subject to or exempt
from the visa requirement and thus providing legal certainty, by complementing
the rules applicable to refugees and stateless persons in order to clarify the applicable visa regime for those residing in the
UK or in Ireland;

41 of 50

Frontex · Western Balkans Annual Risk Analysis 2013

n	making progress towards a full harmonisation of the common visa policy by providing for new, more harmonised rules
with regard to the visa requirement or
exemption applicable to various categories of third-country nationals;
n	providing for clear rules as regards the visa
requirement/exemption for holders of laissez-passers and different passports issued
by certain entities subject to international
law, but which do not qualify as international intergovernmental organisations;
n	adopting new provision in respect of obligations for certain Member States flowing
from prior EU/international agreements
implying the need to derogate from the
common visa rules.
n	As long as there is no agreement on all
the listed elements of the proposal, safeguard clause is not going to come in force.
There are also some divergences between
Member States regarding the reciprocity
mechanism. In practical terms this means
that possible reintroduction of visa obligation using the clause means cannot happen
before early 2014 (given the procedure described in the proposal).

5.3.	Visa liberalisation process
with Kosovo
Kosovo remains the only region in the Western Balkans that is still excluded from the
visa-free travel arrangements. At the end
of 2011, the Council reaffirmed that Kosovo
would benefit from the perspective of eventual visa liberalisation once all conditions are
met and without prejudice to Member States’
position on status.
Against this background and taking into account the Council’s requirements expressed
in various Council conclusions, as well as the
result of numerous expert missions and meetings, the European Commission launched visa
dialogue with Kosovo during January 2012.

42 of 50

The roadmap for visa liberalisation with Kosovo was presented by the European Commission in June 2012. In this framework, Kosovo
was requested first to adopt or amend the
legislation in line with the EU acquis and as
set out in the roadmap. Kosovo is also expected to fully implement the new legislation and all other measures specified in the
roadmap document.
The visa liberalisation roadmap addresses
four sets of issues: document security; border/boundary and migration management;
public order and security; and fundamental
rights related to the freedom of movement.
Kosovo authorities are expected to improve
their capacity to perform border check and
surveillance through enhanced use risk analysis and explore modalities to cooperate with
Frontex in this regard.

5.4.	Home Affairs during
the next Multi-annual
Financial Framework
According to the European Commission’s
proposal, the number of funds in home affairs during the new Multi-annual Financial Framework (period 2014–2020) will be
reduced from the current four to only two:
Migration and Asylum Fund and an Internal
Security Fund.
Both funds will have an external dimension
ensuring continuity of financing, starting in
the EU and continuing in third countries.
There will also be a common regulatory
framework for both funds.
The main innovation of the Internal Security Fund regarding external borders of the
EU and common visa policy are several, including financing of wider scope of actions
based on the four tiers access model and
support to actions in third countries to further EU’s interests.

6. Conclusions
The Western Balkans has gone through rapid
and significant changes regarding irregular
migration trends following the introduction
of visa-free travel arrangements with Member States and Schengen Associated Countries. In terms of illegal border-crossing, the
region has transitioned from largely a source
to mostly transit area given the rapid expansion of secondary movements between
Greece and other Member States through
the Western Balkans during 2011 and 2012.
The preceding assessment shows that for the
second year running, Western Balkan regional
border security is affected the most by the
flow of migrants en route from Greece towards other Member States. This observation in firmly corroborated by the individual
assessments made by all six Western Balkan countries.
Regardless of the uncertainties related to the
sustainability of the operational measures in
Greece, large irregular movements through
the western Balkans are considered as almost certain.
While phenomena such as abuse of legal travel
channels (asylum misuse, document fraud or
illegal stay) by Western Balkan nationals continue, the capacity of border-control authorities to mitigate these threats remains fairly
limited. In fact, large majority of persons who
subsequently submit unfounded asylum application or overstay fulfil all requirements to
legally cross into the EU.
The detailed descriptions of each risk in the
annual risk assessment chapter should provide the reader with a better understanding

of the measures that are required to address
the issues effectively.
Furthermore, all identified risks affect both
the Western Balkan countries and Member States. Therefore, they are undoubtedly
linked to strategic priorities mentioned in
‘EU Action on Migratory Pressures – A Strategic Response’.*
The EU Action on Migratory Pressures was
approved under the Danish Presidency by the
JHA Council in April 2012.

* EU Action on migratory
pressure - A strategic
response (8714/1/12),
Brussels, 23 April 2012

The EU Action is organised under a number
of Strategic Priorities:
I.	Strengthening cooperation with third
countries of transit and origin on migration management;
II.	Enhanced border management at the external borders;
III.	Preventing illegal immigration via the
Greek-Turkish Border;
IV.	Better tackling of abuse of legal migration
channels;
V.	Safeguarding and protecting free movement by prevention of abuse by third
country nationals;
VI.	Enhancing migration management including cooperation on return practices.
The strategic priorities should be updated on
a regular basis or at least twice a year, also
taking into account relevant assessments and
risk analysis of Frontex. This Western Balkans
Annual Risk Analysis and other relevant annual risk analysis products of Frontex should
therefore be seen as giving indicative directions for this review process.

7. Statistical annex
Explanatory note:
Detections reported by Member States for illegal border-crossing between BCPs, illegal
border-crossing at BCPs and refusals of entry are detections/refusals at the common
land borders on entry only. For facilitators,
detections at the common land borders on
entry and exit are included. For Illegal stay,
only detections at the common land borders
on exit are included. For asylum, all applications (land, sea, air and inland) are included.

For WB-RAN countries, all indicators – save
for refusals of entry – include detections/applications on exit and entry at land, sea and
air borders.
Each section of the table (reporting country, border type, place of detection, top
five border sections and top ten nationalities) refers to total detections reported by
WB-RAN countries and to neighbouring
land border detections reported by Member States.
