Frontex official publications fall into four main categories: risk analysis, training, operations
and research, each marked with a distinct graphic identifier. Risk analysis publications
bear a triangular symbol formed by an arrow drawing a triangle, with a dot at the centre.
Metaphorically, the arrow represents the cyclical nature of risk analysis processes and its
orientation towards an appropriate operational response. The triangle is a symbol of ideal
proportions and knowledge, reflecting the pursuit of factual exactness, truth and exhaustive
analysis. The dot at the centre represents the intelligence factor and the focal point where
information from diverse sources converges to be processed, systematised and shared as
analytical products. Thus, Frontex risk analysis is meant to be at the centre and to form
a reliable basis for its operational activities.

Executive summary
Overall in Q2 2013 there were 24 805 detections of illegal border-crossing along the
external borders of the EU. In comparative
terms, this figure represented a 7.4% increase in relation to the same quarter in
2012 and a 155% increase compared to the
previous quarter. This is the sharpest increase between two consecutive quarters ever recorded since 2008, highlighting
the rapidly evolving situation at the external border.
The strong increase was linked to two factors:
(1) better weather conditions in the Mediterranean Sea, which triggered an increase
at the sea border;
(2) a sharp increase in detections at the land
border between Serbia and Hungary.
On the Central Mediterranean route, the
vast majority of migrants were from Eritrea
and Somalia departing from Libya near Tripoli. Increasing detections continued to be
reported in July 2013 in the Central Mediterranean, indicating a resurgence of the irregular migration flow between North Africa
(mostly Libya) and Italy.
The increase on the Western Balkan route
which started in Q1 2013 coincided with a
change in the asylum policy of Hungary as
a measure to harmonise it with EU standards. From January 2013, asylum applicants
were no longer sent to closed centres but
to open centres. Migrants detected crossing the border illegally applied for asylum
and soon afterwards absconded to continue their travel to other Member States.
The peak was reached in June and the flow
decreased in July. The decrease coincided
with Hungary organising a media campaign
in Kosovo* and the return of migrants from

Kosovo*, on two charter flights to Pristina.
Also in July, further amendments were introduced in the Hungarian asylum policy,
in particular detailing the specific list of
grounds for detention of asylum applicants
in closed centres.
At the Greek border with Albania, in Q2 2013
Greece reported the first significant increase
since visa liberalisation status was granted to
Albanian citizens in December 2010. This increase concerned Albanian migrants moving
to Greece as temporary workers.
In the Eastern Mediterranean area, detections were much lower (by nearly 70%) than
in the second quarter of 2012, i.e. before the
strengthening of operational activities implemented a year ago. The decrease is even
more remarkable taking into account the
volatile situation that prevails in the Middle East during the past 12 months, in particular in Syria.
Nevertheless, comparing the situation in Q1
and Q2 2013, detections in the Aegean Sea,
i.e. the main area of detections on the Eastern Mediterranean route, increased significantly and there are reports of an increasing
number of migrants stranded in Turkey and
wishing to enter the EU. An example of this
pressure was revealed in July 2013, subsequent to the reporting period, with the first
detection on the Black Sea in Romania of two
groups of Syrian migrants who had set sail
from a small port near Istanbul.
In the Western Mediterranean, the overall
number of detections in Q2 2013 showed a
decrease compared to last year, even though
diverging trends were observed at the land
(Ceuta and Melilla) and sea borders. In Melilla,

there were increasing attempts to cross the
fence, with the Spanish and Moroccan authorities having to step up their surveillance
measures. By contrast, detections at the sea
were decreasing.

* This designation is
without prejudice to
positions on status, and is
in line with UNSCR 1244
and the ICJ Opinion on

independence.

In terms of nationalities, migrants from Kosovo* recorded the highest increase between
Q1 and Q2 2013, with virtually all detections
reported from the green border between
Hungary and Serbia.
As in 2012, the number of Syrians detected
for illegal border-crossing increased strongly
between the first and the second quarter,
totalling 2 784 in Q2 2013. This represented
an increase of 123% compared to the previous quarter, though the detections were
still lower than at their peak (3 923) in Q3
2012. In Q2 2013, Syrians were mostly reported from the Aegean Sea, where for the
first time they outnumbered Afghans, followed distantly by detections at the Bulgarian land border with Turkey. Following
the Greek operation Aspida implemented
at the land border between Greece and
Turkey, most detections of Syrian nationals shifted from the land border to the sea
border with Turkey.
As was the case in 2012, detections of Afghans increased between the first and second quarters; nevertheless, their total figure
in the second quarter of 2013 was lower than
in any other second quarter since 2008.

6 of 64

In Q2 2013 there were 33 216 refusals of entry at the external border, an increase of
over 19% compared to the previous quarter. The increase was due to an extremely
large number of Russians of Chechen origin refused entry because of lack of visas at
the train BCP on the Polish border with Belarus. Immediately after being refused entry,
they applied for asylum in Poland, but then
travelled to Germany where they also applied for asylum. The phenomenon started in
March and reached its peak in May 2013, and
mostly concerned migrants travelling in family units. This sudden flow could have been
triggered by rumours spreading in Chechnya
about Germany granting asylum to Russians
of Chechen origin.
Regarding other cross-border crimes, cigarette smuggling remained the most often
reported criminal activity in Q2 2013. It regained momentum with the end of winter
and the season-related better accessibility
of areas close to the green border.
As regards the impact of the Syrian conflict,
in April 2013 the EU Counter-terrorism Coordinator warned that around 500 persons
from EU countries were already fighting
on the side of the insurgents. Their potential radicalisation and training in the use of
weapons and explosives could make them
a substantial threat upon return to their
home countries.

1. Introduction
FRAN Quarterly reports are prepared by the
Frontex Risk Analysis Unit and provide a regular overview of irregular migration at the
EU external borders, based on the irregularmigration data exchanged among Member
State border-control authorities within the
cooperative framework of the Frontex Risk
Analysis Network (FRAN) and its subsidiary,
the European Union Document-Fraud Risk
Analysis Network (EDF-RAN).
The main purpose of the FRAN Quarterlies
is to provide:
1.	feedback to the FRAN community in the
context of information exchange;
2.	a periodic update to the situational picture of irregular migration at the EU level;
and
3.	material for constructive discussion on reporting protocols and related trends and
patterns.
This report is intended to simultaneously
serve two objectives: first, to provide a clear
summary of the situation at the external border of the EU, and second, to serve as an archive for future reference and comparative
analyses. Consistent with standard archival
techniques, some information is repeated
among sections to serve as context.

Harmonising complex, multi-source migration data among Frontex and Member States
is an ongoing process. Therefore some of
the more detailed data and trends in this
report should be interpreted with caution
and, where possible, cross-referenced with
information from other sources. The statistics should be understood in the context of
the different levels of passenger flows passing
through different border sections, the activities undertaken by Member State bordercontrol authorities to secure different border
sections, and widespread variation in reporting and data-collection practices.
FRAN members and Member State risk analysis experts and border-control authorities are
considered the primary customers of these
reports. In addition to the discussions taking
place during FRAN meetings, Member State
experts are invited and actively encouraged
to examine and comment upon the data and
analyses presented here. Despite all efforts of
the Frontex Risk Analysis Unit and Member
State experts involved in data exchange and
analyses, it is conceivable that minor errors
will occur in these reports due to very challenging timelines, and the growing volume
and complexity of data and other information exchanged within the FRAN community.

2. Methodology
This, the 20th issue of the FRAN Quarterly,
is a comparative analysis of FRAN data collected between April and June 2013, and
exchanged between 30 Member State border-control authorities within the framework of the FRAN. The report presents the
results of statistical analysis of quarterly variations in eight irregular-migration indicators
and one asylum indicator, aggregated at the
level of the event. Bi-monthly analytical reports exchanged by Member States were
also used for interpretative purposes and
to provide qualitative information, as were
other available sources of information, such
as Frontex Joint Operations.
Precise definitions of Indicators 1 to 6, aimed
at harmonising the data exchanged at EU
level, were presented in the annexes of the
Q1 and Q2 reports in 2009 and so are not
repeated here.
During the June 2010 FRAN meeting, a proposal for a harmonised definition of the return indicator was outlined and several
questions were presented in order to motivate discussion among FRAN members in
view of establishing the regular collection
of monthly return data by Frontex. Subsequently, an online survey of FRAN members
was conducted to gather information and
further motivate discussion to fine-tune the
proposal for the indicator. The 11th FRAN report (Q1 2011) was the first to include analysis
of Indicators 7A and 7B, and the definitions
of these indicators are included in an annex
to that report. Data collection commenced
in January 2011.

The FRAN data-exchange has been in place
since September 2007. Data are exchanged
through the ICONet Internet platform, an

interest group of the European Commission’s CIRCA server. Member State monthly
data are based on a country template prepared by the Frontex Risk Analysis Unit. The
deadline for submitting data for each month
is the 25th day of the subsequent month,
with the exception of the end of year data,
which are requested by 15 January each year.
For this 20th issue of the FRAN Quarterly,
the target for Member States to upload the
monthly data was thus 25 July 2013. In principle, data submitted subsequent to this date
will be reflected in the next FRAN Quarterly, except in cases where clarification is
needed in order to proceed with comprehensive analysis.
Following the closure of the CIREFI working
group in April 2010, most of its mandates and,
of particular relevance, the exchange of data
were transferred to the FRAN. Fortunately,
most CIREFI indicators already overlapped
with the monthly data exchange of FRAN
members. The exception was the indicator
on returns, which was added as part of the
regular data exchange within the FRAN at
the beginning of 2011.
In January 2012, the European Union
Document-Fraud Risk Analysis Network
(EDF-RAN) was formed as a specialist forum to oversee the exchange and analyses
of detections of document fraud to illegally
cross the external borders, and on all international flights.
The EDF-RAN data are checked for inconsistencies, and corrections are made to reported
totals to bring them in line with reported
breakdowns. Corrections are also made to
any three-letter nationality codes not present
in the reference ISO list of nationality codes.*

External borders refer to the borders between Member States and third countries.
The borders between the Schengen Associated Countries (Norway, Iceland and Switzerland) and third countries are also considered
as external borders. The borders between the
Schengen Associated Countries and Schengen Member States are considered as internal borders. For the indicators on detections
of facilitators, illegal stay and asylum, statistics are also reported for detections at the
land borders between the Schengen Member States and Schengen candidates (Bulgaria,
Romania) or non-Schengen Member States
(the UK, Ireland), so that a total for EU Member States and Schengen Associated Countries
as a whole can be presented. It was not possible to make this distinction for air and sea
borders because Member States do not habitually differentiate between extra-EU and
intra-EU air and sea connections but tend to
aggregate data for all arrivals.
When data are examined at the level of thirdcountry nationalities, a large percentage
usually falls under the category ‘Other (not
specified)’ or ‘Unknown’. It is expected that
the percentage reported under these categories will decrease with time as Member States improve the quality and speed
of their identification, data collection and
reporting practices; nationalities are often
reported as ‘Unknown’ if an individual’s nationality cannot be established before reports are submitted.
This issue of the FRAN Quarterly also includes
main findings of Frontex-coordinated Joint
Operations active for at least a proportion of
Q2 2013. Namely, for sea borders they were JO
Poseidon Sea 2013, Focal Points Sea 2013, JO
EPN Hermes 2013, JO EPN Indalo 2013 and JO
EPN Aeneas 2013; for land borders – JO Neptune 2013, JO Poseidon Land 2013, JO Focal
Points Land 2013, JO Focal Points Land 2013
and Project Coordination Points 2013; for the
air border – JO Focal Points Air 2013 and JO

Monthly data on the following indicators were exchanged
among the FRAN community:
1A detections of illegal border-crossing between BCPs
1B detections of illegal border-crossing at BCPs
2 detections of suspected facilitators
3 detections of illegal stay
4 refusals of entry
5 asylum applications
6 document fraud (EDF-RAN)
7A return decisions for illegally staying third-country nationals
7B	effective returns of illegally staying third-country nationals
FRAN and EDF-RAN data used in the tables and charts are as of 1 August
2013

Flexi Force 2013; and the return-related Project Attica 2013.
Both primary data sources, such as interviews
with irregular migrants, and secondary data
sources, such as reports of intelligence analysts, daily reports of deployed officers and
analytical products (weekly and bi-weekly
analytical reports for each abovementioned
operation), were used to provide an exhaustive overview of the situation at the external
borders of the EU. Additionally, open-source
data were researched as background information for the present analysis.
Acknowledgements
The Frontex Risk Analysis Unit would like
to express its gratitude to all FRAN and
EDF-RAN members and their associates in
Member States’ statistical, migration and
document-fraud units who collect, aggregate
and exchange monthly data, and to the analysts who compile the bi-monthly analytical reports, on which much of the detailed
analyses presented here are based.
We are also grateful to Member State representatives who responded to requests for
additional information on key topics and
emerging trends.

4. Situational picture in Q2 2013
4.1. Detections of illegal
border-crossing

was introduced in 2008 a non-Mediterranean
Member State ranked first in detections of
illegal border-crossing.

Overall in Q2 2013 there were 24 805 detections of illegal border-crossing made at the
EU level. In comparative terms, this figure
represented a 7.4% increase in relation to
the same quarter in 2012 and a 155% increase
compared to the previous quarter. This is the
sharpest increase between two consecutive
quarters ever recorded since 2008, highlighting the rapidly evolving situation at the external border.

Figure 2 shows the evolution of FRAN Indicator 1A – detections of illegal border-crossing, and the proportion of detections at the
land and sea borders of the EU per quarter
since the beginning of 2008. In Q2 2013, detections were distributed almost equally between the land (59%) and sea border (41%).
Considering the main year-on-year changes
by Member State as presented in Figure 3,
Hungary reported the largest volume of detections in Q2 2013, which was the first such
event for a non-Mediterranean Member State
since systematic data collection began. Nearly
all detections reported by Hungary were
made at its land border with Serbia.

The strong increase compared to the previous quarter was linked to two factors. Firstly,
the better weather conditions in the Mediterranean Sea, which triggered an increase
in illegal border-crossing detected at the sea
border from 3 700 in Q1 to 10 223 in Q2 2013.
Secondly, a sharp increase in detections of migrants detected at the land border between
Serbia and Hungary. The increase was so
strong at the Hungarian land border that for
the first time since systematic data exchange

This exceptional increase, one of the sharpest observed within the FRAN after the
surge reported in the Mediterranean Sea
in the wake of the Arab spring in 2011, was

Kosovo* or those undertaking secondary
movements after having entered illegally in
Greece. Most migrants applied for asylum
after upon detection but soon absconded
from the centres.

the strongest increase compared to the
situation a year previously

Q2 2013 for the top ten Member States shown by size
of circles; gradient of the lines indicate the percentage
change

Italy also reported a strong increase from Q2
2012 to Q2 2013, mostly due to large arrivals
during Q2 2013 in the islands of Lampedusa
and Sicily and near the coast of Calabria. The
increase continued in July 2013, subsequent
to the reporting period of this report, which
suggests the resurgence of the flow from
North Africa (mostly Libya) to Italy.

In Bulgaria, the displacement brought about
by operational activities in the Eastern Mediterranean area and, in particular, at the land
border between Greece and Turkey, significantly increased detections from Q2 2012 to
Q2 2013. Similarly, the impact of operational
activities was also noticeable in detections
reported by Greece, which strongly decreased
between Q2 2012 and Q2 2013 in Q2 2013(including detections at the land border with
Albania, which, in contrast to the decrease
at the land border with Turkey, actually doubled between these two quarters).

Apart from analysing the changes in terms of
Member State distributions, it is also informative to consider these trends by nationality
of migrants. Figure 4 illustrates the number
of detections of illegal border-crossing of the
top ten nationalities during the second quarters of 2012 and 2013 (size of circles) and the
degree of change between these reporting
periods (slopes).
In terms of nationalities, migrants from Kosovo* recorded the highest increase between
Q2 2012 and Q2 2013, with virtually all detections reported from the green border between Hungary and Serbia. At this border
section, migrants from Kosovo* represented
half of all the detections.

The number of Syrians detected for illegal
border-crossing increased from 2 024 in Q2
2012 to 2 784 in Q2 2013, but detections were
still lower than at their peak (3 923) in Q3 2012.
In Q2 2013, Syrians were mostly reported from
the Aegean Sea, where for the first time they
outnumbered Afghans, followed at a distance
by detections at the Bulgarian land border
with Turkey. Following the Greek operation
Aspida, most detections of Syrian nationals
shifted from the land border to the sea border with Turkey.

Detections of Afghans crossing the border illegally decreased compared to the situation a
year ago. As was the case in 2012, detections
of Afghans increased between the first and
second quarters; nevertheless the total in Q2
2013 was the lowest for any second quarter
since 2008. As shown in Figure 5, detections
of Afghans crossing the border illegally have
fluctuated in the past and are likely to rise in
the third quarter 2013. In fact, since 2008 detections of Afghans crossing the border illegally have always peaked in the third quarter.
The volume of the increase, however, varied
widely from year to year and so is difficult to
predict. Indeed, the situation has been very
volatile in Afghanistan for several years, and
Iran, hosting a large community of Afghan
refugees, has been less and less accommodating for Afghan refugees over the past several months.

Although from a low base, migrants from
Mali registered a very strong increase in Q2
compared with the year previously, from 110
to 635. In Q2 2013 they were mostly detected
in the Pelagic Islands having departed from
Libya. Using predominantly the same route,
migrants from Eritrea also increased sharply
from 461 to 1 948 by quarter a year on.

There were important variations in the extent
to which several nationalities were detected
at specific border sections between the second quarters of 2012 and 2013. The most no-

table one was that migrants from Kosovo*
detected at the land border between Hungary
and Serbia by far outnumbered detections of
any other nationality at a single border section. Detections of illegal border-crossing by
migrants from Kosovo* represented nearly
20% of all detections reported at the external border in the second quarter 2013.
At the same border section, detections of illegal border-crossing of Pakistanis also rose
sharply. As was the case for increased detections of migrants from Kosovo.*
Detections of illegal border-crossing at the land
border between Greece and Albania, 99% of
which concerned Albanians, also rose sharply
compared to the situation a year previously,
and also compared to the situation in the first
quarter of 2013. While the number of detections
remained much lower than in 2010, when they
ranged between 6 000 and 12 000 per quarter, this increase may be an indication of further increases to come in the future.

The following is a list of border sections reporting more than 1 000 detections in Q2
2013 with an indication of the most commonly reported nationalities:
1.	Land border between Hungary and Serbia,
where migrants from Kosovo* represented
about half of the detections, followed by
a wide range of nationalities, most notably Pakistanis;

2.	The Greek Aegean Sea, which in the past
12 months saw an increasing displacement of illegal border-crossings from the
Greek land border with Turkey. For the
first time at this border section, Syrians
were reported in larger numbers than
Afghans;
3.	
T he Italian Pelagic Islands, including
Lampedusa, with detections of a wide
range of illegally crossing African nationals, mostly those coming from the Horn
of Africa (Eritrea and Somalia);

4.	The Greek land border with Albania with
a significant trend of Albanian circular
migrants;
5.	The Italian island of Sicily with most detections being of Eritreans who left from
Libya;
6.	The Bulgarian land border with Turkey,
where Syrians, as in the Aegean Sea,
were the top ranking nationality;
7.	The Italian sea border near Calabria ,
where Egyptians and Syrians were the
most detected migrants. Most migrants
detected crossing the border illegally in
this region had sailed from Egypt or Turkey.

4.2. Routes
For more detailed analyses, detections of illegal border-crossing are frequently classified
into major irregular migration routes, relating to regions of detection rather than linear
routes taken. As illustrated in Figure 6, during the second quarter of 2013 detections of
illegal border-crossing in the Western Balkans ranked first among the main irregular
migration routes. Detections in the Central
Mediterranean area ranked second, as the
detections on this route reported a more

pronounced increase between the first and
second quarters of the year than it was the
case for the Eastern Mediterranean route.
The figure also shows the steady increase in
detections of illegal border-crossing at the
land border between Greece and Albania.
Compared to the situation a year ago, substantial increases (more than 10%) were
reported in the Western Balkans, Central
Mediterranean area, including an increase
in Calabria, and at the land border between
Greece and Albania.
4.2.1. Western Balkan route
Detections of illegal border-crossing strongly
increased on the Western Balkan route, from
2 776 in Q1 to 8 937 in Q2, reaching a record
high since data collection began in 2008. The
increase on the Western Balkan route started
in Q1 2013, coinciding with a change in the asylum policy of Hungary as a measure to harmonise it with EU standards. From January
2013, asylum applicants were no longer sent to
closed centres but to open centres. Migrants
detected crossing the border illegally applied
for asylum and soon afterwards absconded to
continue their travel to other Member States.
The peak was reached in June and in July the
flow decreased, coinciding with Hungary or-

ganising a media campaign in Kosovo* and
the return of migrants from Kosovo*, on two
charter flights to Pristina. Also in July, further
amendments were introduced in the Hungarian asylum policy, in particular detailing the
specific list of grounds for detention of asylum applicants in closed centres.
Virtually all detections were reported from the
border section between Hungary and Serbia.
In fact, detections of illegal border-crossing at
the neighbouring border sections of RomaniaSerbia, Hungary-Croatia and Slovenia-Croatia, all decreased to almost negligible levels in
Q2 2013, indicating a clear motivation of migrants for crossing illegally the land border
between Hungary and Serbia.
The land border section between Hungary
and Serbia is approximately 150-kilometrelong, cut by the expressway linking Belgrade in
Serbia and Budapest in Hungary through the
BCP of Röszke. This is one of the main transit
points for traffic from the Western Balkans
to Member States. Most detections of illegal
border-crossing were reported from the area
around BCP Röszke, as it provides the easiest opportunity for migrants to continue their
journey onwards to Member States.

In previous quarters, the Western Balkan
route was mostly used for secondary movements of migrants who had originally illegally
entered the EU from Turkey to Greece. Detections of illegal border-crossing associated
with such secondary movements indeed increased markedly in Q2 2013, with increasing detections of nationals from Pakistan and
Algeria in particular.
This secondary flow across the Western Balkans includes persons who have stayed in
Greece for a long period, but increasingly also
those who have recently arrived on Greek
Islands from Turkey and are on their way to
other Member States. The growing detections of persons from the regions of North
and West Africa probably also indicates an increase in the use of flight connections from
their origin countries to Turkey.
The sharpest increase was reported for nationals of Kosovo* who had not been detected in large numbers before January 2013
(see Fig. 7). From Kosovo* migrants travel by
public transport to Serbia, which they enter using Kosovo* ID cards, and then they
immediately try to reach Subotica at the
border with Hungary. In Subotica, local fa-

Consequently, detections of Kosovo* citizens
staying illegally in other Member States recorded a marked increase in Germany and
Austria. Similarly, detections of Pakistanis
and Algerians, the main other nationalities
detected at the border between Hungary
and Serbia in Q2, were also increasingly detected staying illegally in Germany, Austria,
France and Italy.
In July, further amendments were introduced in the Hungarian asylum policy,
in particular detailing the specific list of
grounds for detention of asylum applicants

18 of 64

in closed centres (see Section 4.7. Asylum
claims). Information received from the Hungarian authorities and within Frontex Joint
Operations active at the land border between Hungary and Serbia showed that
the number of detections of illegal border-crossing fell markedly in the first few
weeks of July. It is thus expected that the
flow of migrants detected crossing the
border illegally will further decrease in the
third quarter 2013.
4.2.2. Central Mediterranean route
Irregular migration in the Central Mediterranean area increased massively back in
2011, largely due to the political and civil unrest across North Africa, particularly in Tu-

nisia and Libya. Since the end of that year,
irregular migration in the region has been
more stable, but detections of illegal border-crossing markedly increased from 1 124
detections in Q1 2013 to 5 311 in Q2. The increase started in May, as a result of better
weather conditions. According to reports
subsequent to the reporting period, detections further increased in July 2013, indicating a resurgence of irregular migration flow
along this route.
In the second quarter of 2013, most arrivals
were recorded in Lampedusa and in Sicily .
In addition, Malta reported 208 detections
of illegal border-crossing.
Launched on 6 May , the JO Hermes 2013
took over the JO Hermes 2012. The operation was established to support the Italian
authorities in tackling irregular maritime
migration on the coasts of Sicily, Pantelleria
and the Pelagic Islands (Lampedusa, Linosa,
Lampione). Compared to 2012, the operational area has been enlarged to the southeast coast of Sicily.
Most migrants departed from Libya, from
the coastal area near Tripoli. According to
various sources, many more migrants are
waiting on the Libyan coast to travel towards Italy.
Most migrants detected for illegal bordercrossing on the Central Mediterranean
route were from Eritrea (1 824) or Somalia (1 141), together representing 56% of all
detections on this route in Q2 2013. West
Africans (1 088) represented another large
group of migrants, coming mostly from the
Gambia and Mali.
During interviews of migrants conducted in
the framework of the JO Hermes, most Eritreans and Somalis indicated that they had
left their country due to security concerns
rather than economic reasons. Apparently

20 of 64

they were threatened by regional authorities or by members of different clans. Somalis and Eritreans reported using the same
route through Ethiopia and Sudan. Khartoum in Sudan was often mentioned as an
important gathering point, where facilitation services can be easily found. The fare
for transportation from Khartoum to Libya
was mentioned to be at around USD 500,
on Toyota pick-up trucks driven by armed
Chadian nationals. However, once in Libya,
they were requested to pay an additional
fare (USD 200) for the final leg of the journey to Sabha. From there, they had to find
their way to Tripoli. From Tripoli, the sea
crossing to Lampedusa was reported to
cost another USD 500–1 500. All together,
the journey from the Horn of Africa to Tripoli lasted between one and three months,
and the migrants paid between USD 2 000
and USD 4 000, depending on their negotiation skills. In most cases Italy was indicated as the destination country, although
in a few cases, Scandinavian countries were
also mentioned.
Compared to the journey from the Horn of
Africa, the trip from West Africa to Tripoli
was reported as much less costly, at about
USD 1 000. One of the reasons is that migrants from West African countries often find
their own way to Agadez in Niger, using available public transportation. Some claimed to
have paid as little as USD 45 to get from Agadez to the Libyan border. Many reported to
have taken their journey in stages, stopping
over in different cities doing menial jobs to
finance the next leg of their travel.
Egyptians were also reported on the Central Mediterranean route, with 411 detections
in Q2 2013. In this way, Egyptians intend to
avoid being returned to Egypt, as the return
agreement between Egypt and Italy does not
include minors. These cases show that facilitation networks are well aware of Italian
immigration law and use this knowledge to

Some Syrians (163) were also detected, but
during the interviews they mentioned they
had left Turkey on a sailing boat with the
assistance of facilitators. On their way to Italy they stopped to pick up additional migrants. In Q2 2013, a relatively large number
of Pakistani migrants arrived in Lampedusa.
This is rather unusual as Pakistani migrants
are usually detected on the Eastern Mediterranean route. In contrast to most other
migrants who mentioned to have departed
from Tripoli, the Pakistani migrants reported
having left Libya from Zuwarah.
4.2.3. Apulia and Calabria
In Apulia and Calabria in southern Italy,
detections tend to be associated with different movements of irregular migration.
Most of the detections in the area of Apulia
are linked to secondary movements from
Greece to Italy, while most of the detections in Calabria are associated with migrants who departed from Turkey or Egypt,
sailed across the Aegean Sea, often near
Crete, towards Italy.
In this area, the JO EPN Aeneas 2013 started
on 3 June and is scheduled to run until 30 September 2013. The Operational Plan defines
two operational areas (Apulia and Calabria)
covering the shore of the Ionian Sea and part
of the Adriatic Sea. As in previous quarters,
detections in the second quarter of the year
in Apulia (288) were much lower than detections in Calabria (1 000).
With regard to detections in Apulia, reports from the JO Poseidon Sea indicated
many departures from the Greek island of
Corfu. As in previous years, most migrants
were nationals from Asian and Middle Eastern countries who had previously entered
Greece visa the land and sea border. Accord-

contour it as part of their modus operandi to
smuggle migrants into the EU.

Figure 9.Italian coast guards help immigrants out

migrants departed from Libya and were from the
Horn of Africa

ing to migrant statements, Athens remains
the main place for migrants to organise
their trip, with facilitation networks offering various options according to the budget
of the migrants.
Reports from JO EPN Aeneas 2013 show that
the number of migrants illegally crossing the
Ionian Sea from Greece to Italy was decreasing in the recent months. This decrease in
secondary movements is linked to the preference of migrants to travel from Greece across
the Western Balkans to their final destination in the EU.
Interestingly, some migrants were detected
near Bari, in Apulia, and maintained that they
had arrived after leaving Greece and making
the land journey across the Western Balkans.
They made this long journey to Bari following facilitators’ recommendations to present themselves at the CARA Centre on the
grounds that the likelihood for them to obtain asylum was higher there than elsewhere.
These incidents indirectly reveal the ease for
irregular migrants to travel across the Western Balkans from Greece to Italy.
Detections in Calabria were mostly associated with departures from Turkey and Egypt,
and the main nationality detected there

showed that, as in 2012, the modus operandi
involved Egyptian facilitators and Asian irregular migrants. The Egyptian facilitators
using Egyptian fishing vessels departed from
an Egyptian port heading to Crete. Once in
Crete, the migrants were transferred to another fishing vessel to continue their journey towards Calabria in Italy. According to
information provided by migrants, Alexandria continues to be the main hub for migrants wanting to reach Italy. The price
requested by facilitators varies from USD
3 000 to 5 000.
Many migrants reported transhipment in
high seas from large fishing boats to smaller
wooden boats to reach the shores. In July
2013, for the first time, evidence of this modus operandi was obtained from the camera
of an Icelandic airplane deployed in the context of the JO Aeneas.
The facilitation networks operating in Egypt
and Italy maintain contact via satellite telephones. In one case, the facilitators onboard
faced technical difficulties with one boat and
were able to request another vessel to continue the trip to Italy.
The number of Egyptians detected in Apulia
and Calabria reached a record level during Q2
2013. Most of the migrants were single males,
indicating that so far facilitators are still targeting mostly economic migrants rather than
entire family units fleeing violence. Little information could be gathered during interviews, but the migrants did not represent a
particular religious community.
This increase might be a sign that established facilitation networks are taking
advantage of the difficult economic and
political conditions in Egypt to offer their
services to an increasing number of migrants. Nevertheless, the return agreement

22 of 64

between Italy and Egypt continued to be in
force and most detected adult Egyptians
were eventually returned. However, comparing returns and detections of illegal border-crossing, the gap between detections of
illegal border-crossing and return was widening in Q2 2013.
The quick and effective return of migrants
who have crossed the border illegally is seen
as an important measure to prevent wouldbe migrants in Egypt from embarking into a
perilous sea crossing. If the return capacity
would be saturated, for example due to a
sudden and large wave of migrants, it is likely
that the news will spread quickly among
would-be migrants in Egypt and trigger further arrivals.
4.2.4. Eastern Mediterranean route
Since 2008, the Eastern Mediterranean route
has been a major hotspot of irregular migration into the EU, mostly associated with illegal border-crossings from Turkey. However,
since early August 2012 detections on this
route have been at much lower levels. In Q2
2013 there were 4 532 detections of illegal border-crossing on the Eastern Mediterranean
route, which constitutes a decrease of 68%
compared to the same period in 2012. Detections on the Eastern Mediterranean route
represented 18% of the EU total in Q2 2013.
The marked decrease in detections observed
since August 2012 is due to a range of operational activities taking place at different
border sections on the Eastern Mediterranean route:
1.	The Greek operation Aspida deployed
additional manpower, assets and equipment to the Evros region in order to curb
the flow of irregular border-crossing.
The fourth phase of this operation was
launched in April 2013. In addition to the
operation Aspida, the operation Xenios

Figure 10.On 24 July 2013, a transhipment of 83 migrants (Syrians, Egyptians, Palestinians
and Iraqis) in the Ionian Sea was the first documented evidence of this modus operandi; their
places of departure were Alexandria (Egypt) and Latakia (Syria). The video footage (left) was
recorded from an Icelandic aircraft deployed in the framework of the JO Aeneas 2013

Zeus focused on detecting migrants in
land in urban areas around Athens.
2.	A Specialised Police Operation at the Bulgarian-Turkish land border and enhanced
air surveillance have been ongoing since
1 October 2012. Since 1 July 2012, the Bulgarian authorities have implemented an
Integrated Border Surveillance System
(IBSS)* at the border section between
the BCPs of Kapitan Andreevo and Lesovo, covering 58 km. Regular bilateral joint
meetings for preventing and resolving border incidents take place under an agreement signed between Bulgaria and Turkey.

As can be seen in Figure 11, this range of operational activities led to a rapid and sustained decrease in detections. Detections
at the borders with Turkey have remained
lower since the activation of these operational measures. In the second quarter 2013,
detections in the Aegean Sea were the largest on this route, but overall detections were
much lower than a year ago.

3.	The JO Poseidon Land 2013 that was active during Q2 2013 at the land border with
Turkey. Regular meetings between the
Greek and Turkish authorities take place
on a monthly basis with the exchange of
relevant data and information.

With 2 043 detections in Q2 2013, Syrians
were by far the most detected nationality
on this route. More than half of these detections were in the Eastern Aegean Sea region,
with significant numbers also at the Bulgarian land border with Turkey. Interviews are
not routinely performed in Bulgaria, but nationality swapping was confirmed by a Frontex screening team. Nationality swapping
may have artificially inflated numbers of detected Syrians at the Bulgarian land border
with Turkey.

4.	The JO Poseidon Sea 2013 was also active during the reporting period in order
to tackle the flow of irregular migrants
penetrating the external EU sea borders
in the Eastern Mediterranean mainly
from Turkey and, to a lesser extent, from
Egypt.

For much of the last few years migrants
from Afghanistan have been detected in very
high numbers on the Eastern Mediterranean route; in Q2 2013 far fewer (just 1 213)
were detected although they were still the
second most commonly detected nationality on this route.

* The system consists
of stationary posts with
long-range 360-degree
cameras triggered by
movement-detection
sensors. It is currently
operative along a
58-kilometre stretch of the
Bulgarian-Turkish border
plus a short section of the
Greek-Bulgarian border.
It is planned to cover the
whole Bulgarian-Turkish
border by mid-2015.

Greek land border with Turkey
During the first half of 2012, the Greek
land border with Turkey was the undisputed hotspot for illegal border-crossings
into the Schengen area. However, since
August 2012 detections at the Greek land
border with Turkey have been much reduced following the launch of the Greek
operation Aspida.

24 of 64

While detections of illegal border-crossing
have much reduced, the Greek authorities
also regularly reported observing migrants
on the Turkish territory. The Turkish authorities themselves reported on their website the detections of several hundreds of
migrants in areas close to the Greek land
border. These reports are indicative of sustained pressure of irregular migration on
this route.

During the reporting period, the Greek authorities reported several facilitation cases
on roads close to the border, including migrants detected hiding in vehicles on the
Egnatia highway which allows for rapid connection from the Turkish border to the border with the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia. One of these cases involved a
Bulgarian facilitator in a vehicle carrying 11
migrants. Another case involved migrants
hiding in a lorry that had just crossed the
border. The migrants started the journey in
Istanbul and left the lorry before the border. They crossed through the green border
while the lorry crossed the border empty.
They went back on the same lorry once in
Greek territory and were detected on the
Egnatia highway.
These recent cases suggest that, in contrast to the situation in early 2012 when
migrants were actually waiting to be detected by the police, they now try to avoid
detections when crossing the border illegally and during their journey inland. It is
also reasonable to assume that with more
migrants hiding, the number of undetected
migrants may also be increasing, although
so far no evidence to suggest that it would
be in significant number.
Bulgarian land border with Turkey
Detections at the Bulgarian land border with
Turkey began to increase almost immediately
after the beginning of the Greek operation
Aspida, but the Bulgarian authorities were
quick in strengthening their surveillance.
In the second quarter, information gathered
during JO Poseidon showed that migrants
were increasingly detected in the area not
covered by the Integrated Border Surveillance
System (IBSS). Indeed, during interviews, migrants indicated that facilitators were aware

of the border areas under IBSS and advised
migrants to avoid these areas.
The interviews carried out with migrants
apprehended in the Bulgarian operational
area lead to the conclusion that most crossed
the land border with the help of local residents from the area of Edirne who were either working for the facilitation networks
based in Istanbul or were just working on
their own.
Migrants tended to arrive in Edirne using
either public transportation or transport
provided by facilitators, and then they were
handed over to local smugglers with experience in facilitating the border-crossing.
Many were instructed to claim false nationalities, but their fingerprints were recorded
electronically and sent to the EURODAC
database.
Like in neighbouring border sections (the
Greek land border with Turkey and the Aegean Sea), Syrians were the most commonly
detected migrants at this border section.
Based on screening of migrants performed
in Bulgaria, it was established that they
come from different ethnic groups, including Kurds and Palestinians.
The main pull factor for migrants to cross illegally the Bulgarian land border with Turkey
is the relatively cheap price (about EUR 100
to EUR 300) compared to crossing to Greece.
The cheap price may also be an indication
that for many migrants, Bulgaria is not an
option and does not simplify their access to
the Schengen area. Except Syrian families
applying for asylum in Bulgaria with the intention to stay there due to cheaper living
conditions than in Turkey, most other migrants prefer to enter the Schengen area
through Greece and then further on to other
EU Member States.

East Aegean Sea
This border section was ranked second at the
EU level in Q2 2013. For the first time, Syrians
outnumbered Afghans at this border section.
The JO Poseidon Sea 2012 was operational
throughout the reporting period, focussed on
tackling the flow of irregular migrants penetrating the external EU sea borders in the
Eastern Mediterranean mainly from Turkey
and, to a lesser extent, from Egypt.
In the vast majority of cases, the migrants
were given instructions on how to reach the
Greek Islands. The migrants were always
given a reference point on the Greek Islands
(lights of a tourist complex or city, airport
lights, etc.) and were advised to maintain
a steady course towards the lights. Hence
many vessels tended to depart during hours
of darkness rather than during the day.
Based on the information gathered from
interviews it is thought that a considerable number of migrants were arriving undetected on the Greek Aegean Islands. Once
the migrants arrive on the islands, most of
them turn themselves in to the local authorities while a smaller number of migrants try
to leave the islands undetected.
Most of migrants targeted the islands of
Lesvos and Samos. However, detections
were reported also elsewhere in the Aegean Sea, covering a large area from Samothrace Island in the north, reporting its first
detections, and Megisti Island in the south.
The increase in detections in islands that
were previously not considered as main
targets may ultimately reduce the effectiveness of the deployed maritime assets
due to the increasing length of the area
to be covered.
In May, a two-week Turkish Naval exercise was carried out in the Aegean Sea.

26 of 64

This exercise had a direct impact in reducing the number of detections of illegal border-crossing. Soon after it ended, on 3 June,
the number of arrivals of irregular migrants
increased in the operational area of JO Poseidon Sea.
As in previous years, with the beginning of
the tourist season on the Greek Islands, irregular migrants were trying to reach other
EU destinations aboard charter flights, targeting in particular destinations such as
Bergamo, Brussels and Stockholm by using false documents and mixing amongst
the EU citizens returning home after their
holidays.
Syrians have been the most commonly detected migrants during the JO Poseidon Sea
so far in 2013. Most were men travelling
alone but there were some family units, and
all were heading for Sweden or Germany
to claim asylum. Once they entered Turkey, those intending to enter the EU travelled to Istanbul in order to make contact
with facilitation networks. They stayed in
Istanbul for between 1–12 weeks before being taken by van to the west coast of Turkey to depart towards the Greek eastern
Aegean Islands.
Afghans were also detected in this region.
Most were previously resident in Iran. During
interviews conducted during JO Poseidon Sea,
many Afghans stated that they departed from
Iran as a result of the measures implemented
by the government aiming to decrease the
number of Afghan refugees in Iran. The Afghan community in Iran can easily find networks that can smuggle them to Turkey and
then to Greece. Once in Turkey, the Afghan
migrants were transported by public transport to Istanbul and from there mainly by
private transportation directly to departure
area on the western coast of Turkey, where
they boarded rubber boats destined for the
Greek Eastern Aegean Islands.

Information gathered during the interviews
conducted in the framework of the JO Poseidon Sea, revealed that a large number of
irregular migrants, mainly from Syria and Afghanistan, are waiting in Istanbul and Izmir
to enter the EU illegally.
Somalis ranked third on this route and of the
Somali migrants interviewed during JO Poseidon Sea, the majority were males aged 20–30
years, Muslims belonging to the Hawiya, Daroud and Digli tribes. They spoke Somali, Arabic and English. They claimed Greece was
their final destination.
According to information gathered during the
interviews, Ankara is a hub for Somalis due
to the presence of a strong diaspora in the
city. In Ankara, migrants are assisted by fellow nationals that provide them with food
and shelters as well as assistance in contacting facilitators for their illegal border-crossing to Greece.

Flights from Turkey
Since the beginning of the Greek operation Aspida, there has been an increase in
the number of migrants detected arriving
on flights from Turkey using fraudulent
documents, particularly Syrians as well
as other nationalities usually associated
with illegal border-crossing into Greece
from Turkey including Iranians, Iraqis and
Palestinians.
Figure 12 shows the number of detections of
document fraudsters arriving in all EU Member States/Schengen Associated Countries
during each quarter since the beginning of
2011, according to data exchanged under the
EDF-RAN. The number of detections nearly
doubled between the third and fourth quarters of 2012, coinciding exactly with the launch
of the Greek operation Aspida and in the current reporting period detections have reached
unprecedented levels.

27 of 64

Frontex · FRAN Quarterly · q2 2013

By far the most commonly detected documents on flights from Turkey in Q2 2013
were authentic Swedish passports which
were used as impostors mostly detected
at Stockholm Arlanda Airport. Following recent increases, in Q2 2013 Copenhagen Airport detected the most document
fraudsters arriving from Turkish Airports
(34), followed by Düsseldorf (33) and Fiumicino (32).
4.2.5. C
 ircular migration from Albania to
Greece
In Q2 2013, Greece reported a 157% increase
(compared to the previous quarter) in detections of illegal border-crossing at its land
borders with Albania and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which represented a 72% increase in relation to the
second quarter a year previously.
This substantial increase broke the stable
situation in place since the first quarter 2011,
when visa liberalisation was granted for Albanians. Prior to visa liberalisation, detections ranged between 6 000 and 12 000
per quarter. However, since Q1 2011, quarterly detections of illegal border-crossing
were under 2 000 detections.
The introduction of visa liberalisation went
together with a small increase in refusals of entry as more Albanians crossed
the border at BCP. In Q2 2013, refusals of
entry remained stable, as can be seen on
the graph. The same graph also shows
the strong seasonal variations, with summer-peak corresponding to the period of
temporary work in Greece for migrants
from Albania.
Albanians were also detected in large numbers at their land border with Greece using counterfeit border-crossing-stamps in
their passports in order to fabricate travel
histories and extend periods of stay. This

28 of 64

phenomenon was so extensive that Albanians are ranked top for document fraud
at the EU level (see Section 4.8. Document
fraud for more details).
4.2.6. Western Mediterranean route
In Q2 2013 there were over 1 000 detections of illegal border-crossing in the Western Mediterranean region, which consists of
several areas of the southern Spanish coast
as well as the land borders of Ceuta and Melilla from where three-quarters of all detections were reported.
Since Q2 2012, detections on this route have
remained fairly stable – between 1 500 and
2 000 detections per quarter. However, diverging trends are noticeable in detections
at land and sea borders, probably associated with more prevention of departures
at sea by the Moroccan authorities, as well
as strengthened measures in the Mediterranean Sea, including through JO EPN Indalo. Migrants’ preference for avoiding sea
crossings is further supported by the fact
that, unlike in the Central Mediterranean
area, the improvement of weather conditions in June did not result in significant
increase in detections at sea.
Since Q1 2012, detections at the land border (mostly along the fence in Melilla) far
outnumbered detections at the sea border.
The Spanish authorities have been reporting for several months the growing number of migrants established near Melilla.
In Q2 2013, but mostly in July 2013, subsequent to the reporting period, attempts to
cross the fence in Melilla have increased to
such an extent that the Spanish authorities have had to reinforce the number of
police officers and additional equipment
devoted to border surveillance.
At the end of June, the government representative in Melilla, Abdelmalik El Barkani,

In Q2 2013, most of the detections at the
sea border on the Western Mediterranean
route were from Mali and Algeria. Sub-Saharans often stage their journeys, sometimes for years, to work in low-paid jobs to
finance their travel. As for Algerians, they
often mentioned having relatives in Spain
or France.
Analysing the nationalities detected on this
route is problematic as half the detections
from Ceuta and Melilla land border were reported by the Spanish authorities as being of
unknown nationality. However open sources
suggest that there have been increased reports of African migrants storming the border fence in Melilla.
4.2.7. Western African route
In the second quarter of 2013, there were only
few detections of illegal border-crossing in
this region, consistent with the level reported
during the same period in 2012. Compared to
last year, there were much fewer migrants
from Morocco but more from Mali.
Irregular migration pressure on the West African route continued to be much reduced

said at a press conference that the migrants
had attacked the fence ‘very aggressively’
and had thrown rocks at Moroccan security forces which, in addition to Guardia Civil,
have detained migrants who had not yet
made it to the autonomous city. There have
been many sightings of sub-Saharan Africans
who had not yet reached the fence, according to the Spanish Authorities. For the last
few months, the government has warned of
the permanent threat of migration to Melilla.
Once in Melilla, migrants are turned over to
Police Headquarters for identification, and
many are transferred to the Temporary Stay
Centre for Immigrants (CETI – Centro de
Estancia Temporal de Inmigrantes).

Figure 13.	The CETI in Melilla can accommodate up to 480 migrants

tained high level of surveillance ensuring early
detections and collaboration with third-country authorities are key to maintaining the low
level of detections at the border.
4.2.8. Eastern land borders route
The eastern land borders route is, in effect,
an amalgam of detections of illegal bordercrossing reported by Lithuania, Slovakia, Romania, Hungary, Poland, Estonia, Finland and
Latvia. Despite the total length of all the border sections, detections tend to be lower than
on other routes possibly due to the long distances between major hubs and countries
of origin. Visa fraud and counterfeit border-crossing stamps tend to predominate on
this route, as opposed to detections of illegal border-crossing (see Section 4.8. Document fraud).
In Q2 2013, there were just 338 detections of
illegal border-crossing at the eastern land
borders of the EU, which more than the previous quarter but less compared to a year
previously. Since 2009, detections of illegal
border-crossing ranged between 100 and
600 per quarter. Typically, detections on
the Eastern land border are lowest during
the winter months, when weather conditions prevent most of illegal border–cross-

Figure 14. I n July 2013, the Romanian Border Police detected two groups of Syrians who had
illegally crossed the border from Turkey to Romania across the Black Sea. It is the first time
that such incidents were reported in the Black Sea. In both cases, the migrants relied on the
services of Turkish facilitators

ing along the green border, and gradually
increase to reach a peak during the summer months.
In Q2 2013, about one third of the detections
were reported from the land border between
Slovakia and Ukraine , and nearly as many
from the land border between Lithuania and
Belarus. Since 2008, these two border sections often reported the most detections.
Since 2010, the land border between Estonia
and the Russian Federation has often been
on the top three border sections for detections of illegal border-crossing on the Eastern land border.
The top ranking nationality was Georgian,
mostly detected crossing illegally the land
border between Lithuania and Belarus, followed by Moldovans and Vietnamese.
In their bi-monthly analytical report, the Estonian authorities mentioned the continued
report of incidents of irregular migration associated with Vietnamese nationals in areas
outside of BCPs. According to intelligence
obtained during investigation, there are significant numbers of Vietnamese, including
minors, waiting in the Russian Federation
to illegally enter the EU. Most of these migrants left Vietnam several months or even

30 of 64

years ago. They worked in the Russian Federation in the construction industry and in
clothing manufacturers. In neighbouring Lithuania, Vietnamese migrants continued to
be among the most often detected for illegal border-crossing at the land border with
Belarus. Poland also reported the existence
of Vietnamese migrants organising their illegal entry to the EU via the Russian Federation. Many Vietnamese were detected on
secondary movements while entering Poland from Lithuania.
4.2.9. Black Sea route
Detections of illegal border-crossing on the
Black Sea are extremely rare, but Bulgaria
reported one attempt of clandestine entry
at Varna sea port in June, and subsequent
to the reporting period, in July 2013, Romania reported two incidents involving the
detection of 59 Syrians aided by four Turkish facilitators attempting to reach the Romanian coast.
Subsequent to the reporting period, on 6 July
2013, a sailing boat carrying Syrians was detected by the Romanian Border Police close
to Mangalia and two Turkish facilitators were
apprehended. On 27 July, another group of

Syrians was detected, again with two Turkish facilitators, close to Costinesti.
These two incidents still constitute isolated
cases, but they reveal possible increasing
pressure of irregular migration from Turkey
across the Black Sea. They are possibly linked
to the increased surveillance on the Eastern Mediterranean route and the increasing number of migrants waiting in Turkey to
reach the EU illegally.

4.3. Clandestine entry
Restricting the FRAN indicator on detections
of illegal border-crossing at BCPs (1B) to the
external land and sea borders of the EU and
to detections confirmed to be clandestine
entries (e.g. hiding in means of transport),
results in extremely low detections for the
whole of the EU especially compared with
other indicators, such as detections of illegal border-crossing between BCPs. For example, in Q2 2013 only 118 detections were
reported from the whole FRAN community,
down by nearly 10% compared to the previous quarter and down 6% compared to the
second quarter of 2012.
In the case of Slovenia, from where most of
the detections were reported in each quarter for the last year, detections at the border
with Croatia actually fell compared to Q1,
but the total was similar to Q2 2012. Most
of the migrants detected hiding at the Slovenian border with Croatia were Algerians.
Detections increased markedly at the land
border between Hungary and Serbia, and
mostly included Afghans. Nearly all of these
Afghan migrants were making secondary movements after initially entering the
Schengen area in Greece.
In Bulgaria the increased detections of clandestine entries at BCPs were due to more

migrants from Syria, who were increasingly
detected at the land border with Turkey –
probably as a displacement effect from the
Greek land border with Turkey.
In contrast to the low number of detections
of clandestine entry at the external border,
there were more detections within the EU/
Schengen area (349). Although higher than
for the external border, this figure was a reduction of around 15% compared to the previous quarter. The geographical distribution
of these ‘internal’ detections sheds important
light on the direction of secondary movements and the final destination countries
selected by each nationality. For example,
the UK and Italy reported the greatest number of internally detected clandestine irregular migrants.

4.4. Detections of facilitators
Notwithstanding a small increase compared
to the previous quarter (+5%), detections of
facilitators of irregular migration have been
falling steadily for the last two years. According to some reports, this long-term decline
may in part be due to a widespread shift towards the abuse of legal channels and document fraud to mimic legal entry to the EU,
which results in facilitators being able to operate remotely and inconspicuously rather
than accompanying migrants during highrisk activities such as border-crossing.
The long-term decreasing trend in detections
of facilitators is roughly consistent with the
decreasing trend in detections of illegal stays,
as can been seen in Figure 15. This is also an
indication that a large number of facilitation
cases in the EU are linked with facilitation of
illegal stay rather than with facilitation of illegal border-crossing. Indeed, a large share of
detections of facilitators corresponds to detections in Member States that have limited
or no land or sea external borders, like France.

* Some of this decline
was due to changes in
reporting practices in the
Netherlands

Consistent with this long-term decline, in
Q2 2013, there were 1 705 detections of facilitators of irregular migration, down 4.5%
compared to the second quarter of 2012. The
same group of five Member States (France,
Italy, Spain, Greece and Hungary) continue
to share the bulk; together they accounted
for more than 80% of all detections of facilitators at the EU level.
The biggest increase in detections in Q2 2013
was observed in Hungary. Most of these detections were of Hungarian nationals and
were associated with illegal border-crossings from Serbia, which increased in the second half of 2013.
Member States tend to detect more domestic facilitators than any other nationality; very
often most of the top reporting countries for
this indicator tend to report their own citizens as facilitators more frequently than any
other single nationality. In line with this tendency, the top three nationalities of facilitators detected in specific Member States were
Italians detected in Italy, French detected in
France, and Spanish detected in Spain.

4.5. Detections of illegal stay
In Q2 2013, there were over 80 000 detections of illegal stay in the EU, which is a

32 of 64

slight increase of 4% compared to the previous quarter but a decrease of 6% compared to the same quarter in 2012. Except
for the previous quarter, this figure was
among the lowest ever reported for this indicator*, and is consistent with the previously reported slightly declining long-term
trend since 2008 (Fig. 1). However, this longterm decline masks much variation among
Member States.
The vast majority of migrants staying illegally were detected inland and so are presumed to be long-term illegal stayers as, at
the time of detection, they were making no
attempt to leave. The next most common
location for detections of illegal stayers was
those exiting at the air followed by the land
borders whereby illegally staying migrants
were leaving the EU or Schengen area and
may have included those that were over staying by short periods.
The largest increase between Q1 and Q2,
both in terms of volume and in relative
terms, was reported by Hungary. This increase was associated with the increase in
detections of illegal border-crossing at the
land border between Hungary and Serbia.
After detection most migrants applied for
asylum and then absconded. Four nationalities showed significant increases be-

tween Q1 and Q2: from Kosovo*, Pakistan,
Afghanistan and Algeria.
For the fourth consecutive quarter, Germany reported by far the most detections
of migrants staying illegally. In Q2, detections of illegal stay in Germany increased
by 14% compared to the previous quarter,
mostly due to increase of Russians (mostly
of Chechen origin) . This increase in Russians
staying illegally was associated with a large
number of Chechens initially refused entry
in Poland then applying for asylum in Poland,
but whose final destination was Germany
(see Fig. 16). The reason for this increase is
not yet fully understood but is apparently
linked to a rumour that spread in Chechnya
about Germany granting asylum to Russians
of Chechen origin.

In Q2, Moroccans remained the most commonly detected as illegal stayers in the EU,
mostly reported by Spain and France. Russians replaced Afghans on the second rank in
Q2. Ranking fifth, Afghans actually recorded
their lowest number since 2008, mostly in
France.

4.6. Refusals of entry
In Q2 2013 there were 33 216 refusals of entry at the external border, an increase of over
19% compared to the previous quarter and
the quarter a year ago. In fact, in the context
of recent years this figure is one of the largest ever recorded (with the exception of Q3
2009 totalling 34 365). Most of the increase
was at the land border and thus refusals of
entry at the land border represented more

33 of 64

Frontex · FRAN Quarterly · q2 2013

than 60% of all refusals compared to about
half of the total in previous quarters.
The increase was due to extremely large
number of Russians of Chechen origin refused entry because of lack of visas at the
train BCP on the Polish border with Belarus. Immediately after being refused entry, they applied for asylum in Poland, but
then travelled to Germany where they also
applied for asylum. Other Member States,
notably Austria, France, Sweden and Belgium, also reported an increase in asylum application of Chechens, although in
smaller numbers.
The phenomenon started in March and
reached its peak in May 2013, and mostly
concerned migrants travelling in family
units. Virtually all refusals of entry took
place at the train BCP of Terespol through
which trains travel between Minsk and Warsaw. Upon applying for asylum, fingerprints
were taken and the migrants were provided
with travel documents to reach asylum centres in Poland, mostly in Biała Podlaska at 30
km from Terespol. However, most migrants
continued their journey to Germany by train,
relying on facilitation services that provided
them transport by roads to Germany.
In Germany, most migrants applied again
for asylum. They were also registered and
their fingerprints found in the EURODAC
database. They were thus ordered to return to Poland, their first place of asylum
application.
As of June the trends on all three indicators went down, indicating a clear decreasing trend that was confirmed by information
received in July. It can thus be assumed that
this phenomenon was temporary.
The reasons behind this sudden and large increase are not fully understood. There was
no particular security or political incidents

34 of 64

in Chechnya immediately before and during that period, and the economic situation,
while relatively poor, did not change drastically either. This sudden flow could have been
triggered by rumours spreading in Chechnya
about Germany granting asylum to Russians
of Chechen origins.
Indeed, Russian newspapers have published
several articles commenting on the German
Constitutional Court’s decision mandating all
federal units in Germany to calculate basic
benefits under the Asylum Seekers Benefits
Act based on general provisions applicable to
all persons who receive social benefits. These
articles were mentioning significant financial
benefits for asylum seekers and their families. In addition to these press announcements, rumours have also spread among
Russian nationals from Chechnya that they
have high chance of obtaining residence permit in Germany.
In Germany, most Russians claiming asylum
received negative outcomes. In 2012, the recognition rate of asylum applications of Russians was 22% at the EU level and only 17%
in Germany.
On their side, the Belarusian authorities appeared to do minimum efforts to prevent
exit of migrants transiting through Belarus. In its bi-monthly analytical report, Estonia pointed to the fact that since October
2012, due to the freezing in EU assistance to
Belarusian border-control authorities, Belarus has suspended the identification of irregular migrants moving to EU countries.
The minimum collaboration from the Belarusian counterpart probably also contributed
to the development of this phenomenon at
the Polish border.
It is not the first time that a similar outbreak
of illegal entry occurred at the land border
between Poland and Belarus, comprised of
the same combination of refusals of entry

followed by asylum applications in order to
stay illegally in the EU. In 2009, from June
to September, a large number of Georgians
were refused entry at the same border section, who then applied for asylum before absconding to other Member States.
These random surges of migrants are very
difficult to predict and even more difficult to
prevent. Indeed, border-control authorities
alone cannot prevent these kinds of flows
and so at least part of the solution requires
the coordination of efforts with asylum authorities and national police authorities at a
national and EU level.
Elsewhere, refusals of entry were relatively
stable compared to previous quarters. The
main grounds for refusals of entry was the
lack of visas (13 891) followed by the lack of
justification for the purpose of stay. Albanians continued to rank first at the air border
where they were mostly refused at Italian
airports.

4.7. Asylum claims
Compared to the previous quarter, the number of asylum claims reported within the
FRAN increased by 17% to a total of 85 362
applications in Q2 2013. This was also an increase of 43% compared to the second quarter of 2012. (Note: the FRAN data do not
include asylum applications submitted inland in France or the Netherlands).
Much of the increase was due to more asylum applications submitted by Russians of
Chechen origin in Poland and then again in
Germany (see Section 4.6. Refusals of entry). In total, the number of applications
of Russians increased from 7 010 applications in the first quarter 2013 to 15 453 applications in the second quarter. Most of
these applications are of the same individuals who first applied in Poland and then
in Germany.

Hungary also reported a staggering increase
in asylum applications, one of the most spectacular increases recorded in the FRAN. This
increase coincided with the change in legislation in the Hungary asylum policy that entered into force in January 2013. According to
this amendment, the lodging of an asylum application and the start of an asylum procedure
constitutes an explicit ban on expulsion and
removal from the territory. Asylum-seekers
who immediately ask for asylum upon being
apprehended by the police (before the end of
their first interview), between January and
June 2013, were not detained. Instead, pursuant to the modifications that entered into
force in January, in order to harmonise the
Hungarian asylum policy with EU standards,
first-time asylum applicants were all accommodated in an open facility.
The migrants who used this modus operandi to enter the EU can be classified into
two categories: first, those making secondary movements through the Western Balkans after entering illegally the EU in Greece,
mostly Afghans, Pakistanis and Syrians. Second were those from the Western Balkan
region, mostly from Kosovo.* For both categories of migrants, the number of detections
of illegal border-crossing and asylum applications sharply increased after January 2013.
Subsequent to the reporting period, in July
2013 further amendments were introduced
in the Hungarian asylum policy, in particular
detailing the specific list of grounds for detention of asylum applicants in closed centres. Grounds for asylum detention under
the new rules include: (a) For the verification of the applicant’s identity and nationality; (b) The asylum-seeker absconded or
hinders the processing of the asylum procedure in any other way; (c) In order to
obtain the information necessary for the
processing of the asylum claim, if there are
serious grounds to presume that the asylum-seeker would delay or hinder the pro-

Swiss back tighter asylum rules

On 8 July 2013, EASO released its second Annual Report on the Situation
of Asylum in the EU, covering the year
2012. The report aims to provide comprehensive overview of the situation of
asylum in the EU, looking at the flows
of applicants for international protection in the EU, analysing application and
decision data, and focusing on some of
the most important countries of origin
of applicants for international protection in 2012. The report underlines the
wildly different characteristics of asylum applicants in the EU, notably among
applicants from Afghanistan, Syria and
the Western Balkan countries.

36 of 64

Almost 80% of voters approved
changes made to the asylum law
last September, final results of a referendum said. Under the new rules
military desertion is no longer a reason for granting asylum, and people
cannot now apply through Swiss foreign embassies. About 48 000 people
are in the process of seeking asylum in Switzerland, twice the European average per head
of population.

cedure or would abscond; (d) In order to
protect the public order and national security; (e) If the claim has been submitted
at the airport; (f) The applicant has repeatedly failed to fulfil his/her obligation to attend procedural acts and thus hinders the
processing of a Dublin procedure. It should
be noted that asylum-seeking unaccompanied minors cannot be detained.

In 2013, there were 335 365 asylum applications in the EU, of these 260 575
were ‘new’ applicants for international
protection. Afghanistan continued to be
the most numerous overall in the EU,
and included large number of unaccompanied minors. Syria showed the largest increase in applications due to the
deteriorating security situation in Syria
over the course of the year. The report
underlines that when summed together,
applicants from the six Western Balkan
countries, continued to represent the
highest number of applications made in
the EU for asylum (more than Afghanistan and Syria combined), despite the
fact that Member States judged such
applications to well-founded in only
4% of cases overall. EASO will publish a
comprehensive report on the Western
Balkans in the second half of 2013.

Information received from the Hungarian authorities and Frontex Joint Operations active
at the land border between Hungary and Serbia showed that the number of detections of
illegal border-crossing fell markedly in the
first few weeks of July. It is thus expected
that the flow of migrants detected crossing
the border illegally will decrease in the third
quarter 2013. In Bulgaria, the number of asylum applications also rose sharply, although
from a lower base, which was mostly due to
Syrian nationals.

The number of Syrians applying for asylum in the EU as a whole decreased slightly
compared to the previous quarter, by 5.5%.
In Q2 2013, a total of 7 917 Syrians applied

centres with a capacity of 200 and 120 places,
respectively, are under construction in Lesvos and Attiki and will be fully operational
by the end of 2013.
The reform of the asylum system in Greece
is currently in a transitional stage, during
which the asylum-procedure continued to
be carried out by the police and the transfer
to the new services is being prepared. Under the new system, the Ministry of Public
Order and Citizen Protection and its services as well as the Directorate for Social
Perception and Solidarity of the Ministry
of Labor, will be competent for the reception of asylum-seekers and unaccompanied children.
Dublin III
On 29 June 2013, the EC Regulation 343/2003,
known as Dublin II, was recast. The new regulation, Regulation (EU) No 604/2013, known
as Dublin III, was jointly adopted by the European Parliament and the European Council. It entered into force 19 July 2013 and shall
apply to applications lodged six months following its entry into force.
This recast is part of the development of
the Common European Asylum System. This
new regulation will contribute to harmonising practices in place in Member States. It
contains a new right to information for asylum applicants, introduces a personal interview and put an obligation on the European
Commission to produce a common information leaflet. It also contains a new provision on judicial remedies for asylum seekers
to challenge Dublin decisions where transfers would not be in compliance with their
fundamental rights.

4.8. Document fraud
In Q2 2013 there were just over 2 300 detections of document fraud on entry to the
EU/Schengen area from third countries,
which is an increase of 8% compared to a
year previously in Q2 2012. However, France
exchanged usable data for the first time in
2013, which inevitably inflated the figures to
a certain degree, particularly on entry from
third countries; omitting the French data actually resulted in a slight decrease in detections at the external border compared to a
year previously.
Spain, France, Greece and Germany reported
the most detections on entry at the external border together accounting for around
half of all detections at the EU level. Spain
reported more detections than ever before,
but this increase was difficult to analyse as
it was mostly due to unknown nationalities
arriving at Madrid Barajas Airport from unknown airports.

Royal Netherlands Marechaussee
Identity Documents (ID) Desk(s)
On 31 May 2013 four Royal Netherlands
Marechaussee ID Desks were opened
at Eindhoven, Rotterdam, Schiphol and
Zwolle. They will provide document expertise on the highest level to the National Police in the fight against identity
fraud. The information collected by the
ID desks and future desks of the National Police will be gathered at the
Identity Fraud and Documents Centre of Expertise (ECID). This cooperation adds significant value to
trends and analyses in the search
of suspects of fraud.

As well as at the external border, also important at the EU level were the detections
of document fraud between the Schengen
area and non-Schengen EU Member States.
As is normally the case, many of these were
reported on entry to the UK, a common
destination country for irregular migrants
travelling from the Schengen area.
The EDF-RAN data exchange also considers detections of document fraud on intraSchengen flights whereby no border checks
are systematically performed. In Q2 2013 there
were 775 detections of document fraud on
flights between Schengen airports, which is

a slight increase following the lowest ever
level during the previous quarter. The decrease during the first few months of 2013
was widely recognised to be associated with
the Greek operation Aspida at the Greek land
border with Turkey, which prevented many
migrants from entering Greece from Turkey
and then boarding intra-Schengen flights
in Athens.
Migrants from Albania
In Q2 2013 some 725 Albanians were detected using more than 900 fraudulent documents, which is a decrease compared to
other reporting periods over the last year.
Nevertheless, Albanians still represent the
biggest proportion of document fraud at
the EU level.
Albanians were mostly detected on entry to
the Schengen area from a third country (253)

but also travelling between the Schengen
area and non-Schengen EU Member States
(138). The latter flow was almost exclusively
between the Schengen area and the UK,
sometimes via Ireland.
Overall Greece detected more Albanians than
any other Member State, mostly on entry at
the Greek BCPs Kakavia and Kristalopigi, but
at a much reduced rate compared to a year
previously in Q2 2012.
Migrants from Syria
Overall, some 557 Syrians were detected using fraudulent documents in Q2 2013, which
is one of the highest ever recorded numbers for this nationality and more than double the number reported a year ago in Q2
2012. Syrians were mostly detected on entry to the Schengen area from third countries
(278), which is in contrast to a year previously when they were mostly detected on
intra-Schengen flights. Following continued
increases over the last year, their most common embarkation point in Q2 2013 was Istanbul (173), particularly on flights to a range
of Germany airports. Hence, Germany detected more Syrians than any other Member State, followed by Greece, where in both
countries detections were distributed among
several airports.
Legal channels
Although lacking a systematic data exchange
among Member States, many reports conclude that the abuse of legal channels to illegally enter the EU is increasing.

4.9. Returns
4.9.1. Return decisions
In Q2 2013 there were 53 586 third-country
nationals subject to an obligation to leave the
EU as a result of an administrative or judicial

decision, which is a decrease of a fifth compared to during the same period in 2012. The
UK reached more decisions to leave than any
other Member State, but there were more
Pakistanis that were subject to a decision to
leave in Greece (1 694) than any other nationality in a single Member State.
Most of the overall decrease was due to
fewer decisions being made in Greece,
where throughout 2012, more decisions
to leave were reached than in any other
Member State. Most of these decisions to
leave were handed to migrants after they
were detected illegally crossing the land
border between Greece and Turkey. During the first half of 2012 detections of illegal border-crossing in this region were very
significant at the EU level, but have subsequently fallen to very low levels (see Section 4.2.4 Eastern Mediterranean route);
correspondingly the number of return decisions reached in Greece also fell down,
affecting figures for the EU as a whole.
Note that the absolute total number of
migrants subject to return decisions is still
underestimated by this indicator, as data
on decisions were unavailable from, inter
alia, France, the Netherlands and Sweden,
where it is assumed that high numbers of
decisions were reached.
Notwithstanding return decisions reached in
Greece, there was very little change in the
number of decisions made by other Member States. The UK for instance reported
little change in the number of return decisions reached, and while some other Member
States reported changes of between -20 and
+20%, these changes were within the range
of previous reporting periods.
More Albanians were subject to decisions
to leave than any other nationality (4 588),
followed by Pakistanis (4 034), Moroccans
(3 242) and Indians (2 624). Albanians and

Pakistanis were mostly issued decision to

At the Member State level there is often a discrepancy between the number of return decisions reached and the number of effective
returns carried out. Some of the differences
may be due to time lags between judicial decisions and actual returns, while other differences may due to the disappearance of
migrants once a decision has been reached.
4.9.2. Effective returns
In Q2 2013, there continued to be a steady
trend in the number of third-country nationals
effectively returned to outside the EU compared to most previous quarters in 2012 and
2013. The total number of 39 741 was in the
range that varied between 38 000 and 42 000
per quarters, showing a small increase of 4%
compared to the previous quarter.
As has been the case during every quarter of
data exchange so far for this indicator, the UK
conducted the largest number of returns, in

40 of 64

this case down by 3% compared to the previous quarter. Greece, ranking second, mostly
reported the effective return of Albanians.

4.10. Other illegal activities at
the border
Information gathered through Frontex Joint
Operations and Member State bi-monthly reports in Q2 2013 shows a continuously high
level of criminal activities at the EU external
borders and, in the case of stolen vehicles
detected on exit and cigarette smuggling, a
substantial increase.
At the EU eastern borders, cigarette smuggling remained the most often reported
criminal activity in Q2 2013. It regained momentum with the end of winter and the
season-related higher accessibility of areas
along the land border. Recent detections
show that some criminal groups involved
in this illicit trade used their large proceeds
to invest in technical solutions such as an
unmanned raft equipped with an electronic
navigation system.

At the EU external borders to the Western
Balkans, law-enforcement operations in Q2
2013 confirmed that some criminal groups
from that region continued to use their existing smuggling infrastructure to gradually
move into the cocaine trade.
In Q2 2013, with the season-related resumption of Frontex Joint Operations in
the Mediterranean, more consistent information on the smuggling of excise goods
and drugs fed into the quarterly analysis
of illegal activities along the southern sea
borders of the EU.
4.10.1. Trafficking in human beings (THB)
The Spanish Cuerpo Nacional de Policia developed a plan against trafficking in human
beings for the purpose of sexual exploitation,
which entered into force in April. In consideration of the EU Strategy towards the Eradication of THB (2012–2016), the plan is based on
the following priorities: enhancing the prevention of THB; enhancing the identification
and detection of potential victims; increasing
the prosecution of traffickers; in depth examination and analysis of all aspects of THB;
adjusting and optimising software tools for
the analysis of THB; and strengthening national and international cooperation for the
eradication of THB.
At the beginning of July, the Spanish authorities disrupted an organised crime group and
arrested six of its Nigerian members. The organisation was responsible for transporting
Nigerian women from deprived areas in Benin
City to Spain for the purpose of sexual exploitation. The whole journey took between four
and five months. They were usually recruited
on African soil through partial deception,
which means that they presumably knew
they were going to work in the sex business,
but were deceived by false promises of good
working conditions and large earnings. After
their overland travel to the Moroccan coast,

they were smuggled in small boats across the
Strait of Gibraltar into Spain (mainly Cataluña
and Málaga). The investigation revealed the
use of physical coercion and psychological
pressure, e.g. through ‘juju’ rituals.
In June, the French authorities dismantled
a Nigerian criminal organisation, which had
forced more than 100 Nigerian women into
prostitution. The arrested traffickers were
responsible for performing different tasks,
such as the organisation of activities, the
facilitation of travel, the accommodation of
victims and the forgery of documents. Less
typical of Nigerian groups dealing with THB
was the involvement of a priest who kept in
touch with the victims and provided them
with fraudulent documents supporting their
asylum applications. Already in May 2012, one
of the heads of the organisation had been arrested in the UK.
4.10.2. Smuggling of tobacco products
Eastern borders
Large differences in cigarette taxes between
the EU countries and their eastern neighbours maximised the proceeds from this
illegal trade, which is conducted on several organisational levels from small smugglers crossing the border with cigarettes in
their private vehicles to large criminal organisations that systematically transport
large amounts in commercial lorries. While
a pack of cigarettes currently costs between EUR 2.60 and 2.90 in Estonia and up
to EUR 11.50 in Norway, it would only cost
between EUR 1.30 and 1.50 in the Russian
Federation.
If the Russian Ministry of Finance raises the
tax on tobacco by 50% as planned at the beginning of 2014, these price differences will
decrease. This measure would raise the price
of an average pack of cigarettes to approximately EUR 2.10, which would reduce the

profits of smugglers. In order to fight health
hazards and to adapt taxation levels in the
Russian Federation to the European average,
the WHO even proposes a sevenfold hike in
excise duties on tobacco until 2020. However, cigarettes in Belarus and Kazakhstan
continue to be considerably cheaper, so the
existing Customs Union with these countries will ensure a steady flow of tobacco
products to the Russian Federation. For this
reason, the amount of tobacco products illegally brought into the EU is not expected to
decrease considerably as long as the excise
tax policies in the Customs Union of Belarus, Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation
and in other countries in the region such as
Ukraine and Moldova are not harmonised.
Most seized contraband passing through
BCPs was found in luggage compartments of
private vehicle, often those with tinted windows. Double walls, spare wheels and secret
compartments in doors or other parts of the
cars were also used to hide cigarettes. Passenger trains were regularly used to smuggle
comparably smaller amounts of cigarettes,
which were hidden under seats and beds or
in the ceiling.
In April, Lithuanian authorities raided a farm
building near Kaunas, where they found 6.9
million cigarettes of the brands ’Jin Ling‘, ’New
Line‘, ’Bayron‘ and ’Bayron Light‘ with Rus-

42 of 64

sian excise stamps affixed. Eight persons, one
Russian and seven Lithuanians, aged between
29 and 45 were arrested. The cigarettes had
been previously smuggled from the Kaliningrad Oblast through the BCP of Kybartai.
The record amount seized in this case is in
line with a recent upward trend registered by
the local authorities. According to the Lithuanian Ministry of the Interior, in comparison to the same period in 2012, the amount
of smuggled cigarettes seized by authorities
between January and mid-May 2013 rose by
87%, thus exceeding one million packs.
Also in June, Romanian authorities made their
largest discovery of smuggled cigarettes in
the last three years. In the town of Vicsani,
more than two million cigarettes were found
on a freight train from Ukraine. The contraband was hidden within thoroughly hollowed wood logs. The logs were filled with
packs of cigarettes connected by a rope for
easy retrieval and placed on two of the several railway cars. The contraband could only
be detected after a careful examination and
fragmentation of the logs.
The border authorities of third countries substantially contributed to the fight against
the smuggling of excise goods into the EU.
At the end of June 2013, Ukrainian border
guards detected suspicious activities at the
Polish border near the BCP of Dorohusk. After a closer examination, they found several
persons unloading boxes from two minivans
into a rubber boat. The boxes were supposed
to be transported across the river Bug to Poland (see Fig. 18). Eventually, authorities arrested seven persons and seized more than
1.24 million cigarettes produced in the Russian Federation and Ukraine.
Western Mediterranean and West
African routes
The Western Mediterranean Sea showed
to be significantly affected by the smug-

gling of tobacco products during the reporting period.
In Q2 2013, law-enforcement authorities performed an operation to tackle the
smuggling of tobacco products in Spain,
Portugal, France and Belgium. This was
considered to be one of the largest operations of the current year and it resulted in
2 668 250 packs of cigarettes being seized
and 13 persons arrested in the Spanish cities of Seville, Algeciras and Valencia, and
also in France and Portugal. The criminal
network, which was composed of Spanish, Belgian, Irish and British citizens, had
the capacity to act on a global scale and
it is believed that the organisation had the
ability to smuggle at least ten containers
of tobacco per month. The criminal group
reportedly gained 1.1 million in profits per
container of the contraband.
The tobacco products were mainly produced
in Asia and then shipped to Europe via African countries to the ports of Algeciras, Valencia, Antwerp and Lisbon. In order to hide
and distribute the contraband, the criminal
organisation created a business structure
composed of several front companies responsible for performing business transactions and false tax returns. Therefore, once
the tobacco was in EU territory it was distributed to several EU countries through the
logistics network of the companies.

leased in June 2013 by the UN Office on Drugs
and Crime highlights a growing number of
cocaine seizures conducted in countries all
along the Balkan route, including Turkey,
Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia, Albania, Hungary
and Austria. Criminal organisations in Turkey originally smuggling heroin increasingly
added cocaine trafficking to their repertoire,
and reports from the Western Balkans show
that groups in other countries are following
suit. According to UNODC, criminal groups
from West Africa are often involved in this
trade as a large part of the substance transits Africa before its arrival on the Balkans
route. In other cases, the cocaine arrives on
container ships from South American countries such as Brazil. However, the amount of
cocaine arriving in the EU from the Western Balkans is by far outnumbered by quantities entering the EU through the Iberian
Peninsula.

Western Balkans

In the second quarter of 2013, several criminal networks involved in the smuggling of
cocaine and heroin were disrupted in the
Balkans. On 8 May, the fYROM, German and
Austrian police arrested five persons in the
course of the joint operation ‘Dirigent’. The
crime group, which was known as the ‘Frankfurt Mafia’, trafficked heroin from Afghanistan along the Balkan route to major cities in
the EU. The criminal organisation was composed of decentralised cells with different
roles assigned, ranging from transporting,
receiving and selling the drugs to laundering the proceeds, which was done by fast
money transfers to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.

Western Balkan countries play a significant
role as the main entry point of heroin from
Afghanistan to Europe. As the supply of heroin from Afghanistan and demand in Western Europe has been decreasing, criminal
groups appear to be trying to compensate for
their losses by expanding the scope of their
business. The World Drug Report 2013 re-

At the end of May 2013 an international
police operation was simultaneously conducted in Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and the Netherlands.
It led to the arrest of several persons of different nationality who smuggled and sold
large amounts of cocaine from Latin America. The group was also involved in the pro-

duction of marijuana, as police confiscated
over 1 500 cannabis plants. Around EUR 1
million was seized during the operation.

* This designation is

in line with UNSCR 1244
and the ICJ Opinion on
the Kosovo declaration of
independence.

Earlier in May, Kosovo* police arrested the
head of a transnational criminal organisation which was involved in drug trafficking
and distribution for many years. The arrest
was based on an international warrant issued by Bosnia and Herzegovina. The suspect reportedly started his criminal business
through the smuggling of tobacco products
and gradually became involved in the trafficking of heroin and cocaine through Turkey,
Albania, Kosovo*, Montenegro, Serbia and
Bosnia and Herzegovina. His family members own numerous companies in these
countries, through which the proceeds of
crime were allegedly laundered.
The Western Balkans continue to play an
important role in cannabis trafficking both
as a region of transit and origin. Firstly, this
route is used to smuggle cannabis from
Afghanistan to the EU. According to the
UNODC World Drug Report 2013, global
seizures of Afghan cannabis increased between 2002 and 2011, but production remained rather stable since 2009. Secondly,
the increasing production of cannabis in Albania makes the region an important supplier of the EU market.
In Q2 2013, assets deployed through Frontex Joint Operations uncovered numerous
attempts to smuggle cannabis products
from Western Balkan countries into the
EU. Border guards seized more than 205 kg
of marijuana in 17 different cases. The substance was hidden in luggage, behind double walls or in secret compartments of
private vehicles, e.g. in the steering wheel
or under the dashboard. In some cases, minor amounts were hidden on the person,
in luggage compartments or under seats
of public buses.

Western Mediterranean and West
African routes
The Iberian Peninsula, due to its geographical
proximity to North Africa and a long coastline, represents a major entry point of illicit
drugs smuggled into the EU. Seizures in Q2
2013 confirmed that Spain plays a major role
in the transit of drugs which are subsequently
distributed to the whole European market.
According to the UNODC World Drug Report
2013, Spain accounted for 34% of the global
seizures of hashish in 2011. Hashish, which
mainly arrives in the Iberian Peninsula from
Morocco, is the drug that is most frequently
seized through police operations (see Fig. 19).
Cocaine is either smuggled to Spain directly
by sea and air from Latin America, or transited through West or North African countries. From Spain, large quantities of these
drugs are transported in lorries to the rest of
Europe for street distribution. The traffickers use several different routes and sophisticated concealment methods making the
detection of these activities difficult.
To avoid detection traffickers usually use rubber speedboats, fishing boats and jet skies to
smuggle narcotics from North Africa to the
Spanish coast. However, to transport large
amounts of drugs on longer distances, e.g.
from South America, commercial cargo ships
are usually used.
On 2 May, agents of Guardia Civil conducted
an operation in the provinces of Málaga and
Cádiz, which led to the seizure of almost
500 kg of hashish and the arrest of 30 suspects of Spanish, Moroccan and Italian nationality. The drug was transported on fishing and
pleasure boats from Morocco to selected locations in the area of Costa del Sol and the Strait
of Gibraltar, where the smugglers handed the
drugs over to couriers to be smuggled onshore and stored in several safe places with
easy access from the sea.

Air routes are also used to smuggle narcotics
from Morocco to Spain. On 23 April, an ultra
light helicopter heading to Málaga and carrying 110 kg of hashish from Moroccan suppliers was intercepted during a joint operation
of the Spanish police and Guardia Civil. This
means of transport is relatively easy to obtain
and its use is a way of avoiding the tight security controls at commercial airports.
Eastern borders
In Q2 2013, narcotic drugs were crossing
the EU external eastern border from both

sides. Whereas most detected cases involved individuals trying to cross the border with small amounts meant mainly for
personal consumption, border authorities
estimate that Europe is not only a destination country for Afghan heroin, but
also a major transit region of various types
of narcotics smuggled eastwards. In several cases, criminals were caught while attempting to cross the EU eastern borders
with cannabis originating from Morocco
or cocaine originating from Latin America destined for the Russian Federation or
other countries of Central Asia.

In late May 2013, Spanish authorities
performed the Operation Albatros, resulting in the seizure of 3 400 kilos of
cocaine and the arrest of 21 persons.
The fishing boat, carrying a Senegalese flag, was intercepted in the Atlantic Ocean in the area between South
America and the archipelago of Azores.
The boat departed from Venezuela
heading to Vigo (northwest Spain),
mainly with Korean and Indonesian
nationals onboard.
This organised network consisted of a
supplier in Venezuela, a second group
in Galicia (Spain), responsible for receiving the drug and the land distribution, and a third cell in charge of all
logistical aspects of the operation to
transport the drugs from the high
seas to the coast in speedboats
or fishing boats.

4.10.4. Exit of stolen motor vehicles
Eastern Borders
Frontex Joint Operations reported a significant increase in the number of stolen vehicles detected at the EU’s eastern borders in
Q2 2013. A total of 132 stolen vehicles were
prevented from crossing the border in Q2
2013, whereas 96 were detected in the same
period of 2012 and only 53 in the first quarter
of 2013. As in previous quarters, the largest
number of cars were detected on exit from
Poland to Ukraine (see Fig. 20), although
only 52 vehicles were identified in Q2 2013,
compared to 58 in the same period of 2012.
Since 2012, the number of detections at the
Polish-Belarusian and Slovakian-Ukrainian borders has been rather low but relatively stable.

46 of 64

The most commonly detected brand at the
eastern border in Q2 2013 was Mercedes Benz,
with 23 detections, followed by Volkswagen
and BMW cars, which were prevented from
leaving the EU in 15 and 13 cases, respectively.
Audis and Fords were identified as stolen in
seven incidents each. The single model most
often smuggled across EU eastern borders
was BMW X5, which was detected by border authorities in eight cases.
Western Balkans
The Joint Operation Focal Points Land reported the detection of 23 stolen vehicles
at the EU’s external borders to the Western Balkan countries. Most of the stolen
cars were prevented from leaving the EU
between Slovenia and Croatia. Nine stolen
motor vehicles were stopped in attempts
to enter Serbia.
Western Mediterranean and West
African route
In Q2 2013, 17 incidents involving stolen vehicles were reported through Frontex Joint
Operations in the Western Mediterranean
Sea. As a result, 23 persons of Moroccan
and other nationalities were caught during the attempted exit of these stolen vehicles, in many cases presenting forged car
documents.
4.10.5. Fuel smuggling
The smuggling of fuel from Libya to the EU
has become a major issue for law-enforcement authorities in the central Mediterranean Sea. At the beginning of April, a Libyan
patrol boat stopped a Panamanian-registered ship called Levante on its way to Malta,
which was loaded with contraband fuel. After the vessel was ordered to return to Tripoli, seven Egyptians and one Maltese national
were arrested. The crew members admitted that they had already made four trips in

At the beginning of July, the Armed Forces
of Malta foiled another attempt to smuggle
fuel from Libya. A Maltese maritime patrol
aircraft detected the vessel MV Alice transferring Libyan fuel to four Maltese vessels on
the high seas. After being ordered to enter
the port in Valletta, the authorities established that the MV Alice had 80 000 litres of
contraband fuel onboard. Large amounts of
the fuel were spilled into the sea during the
ship to ship transfers, thus creating damage
to the environment. The law-enforcement
operation eventually led to the arrest of 28
persons of Maltese, Indonesian and Egyptian nationality.
4.10.6. Terrorism
On 21 June, the Spanish police arrested eight
people accused of funding and facilitating the
travel of potential foreign fighters to Syria.
The Spanish citizens operated from the Spanish enclave of Ceuta and the Moroccan city
of Fnideq. According to a statement made by
the Spanish Ministry of Interior, the al-Qaedalinked group managed to recruit dozens of
persons from Spain and Morocco and arranged their travel via Turkey to Syria, where
they were allegedly trained and involved in
insurgent warfare and terrorist attacks.
The participation of Europeans in rebel activities in Syria is of major concern for police authorities and intelligence agencies in
the EU. In an interview with the BBC given
on 24 April 2013, the EU Counter-terrorism
Coordinator Gilles de Kerchove warned that
around 500 EU nationals were already fighting with the insurgents. German law-enforcement authorities recently reported that

48 of 64

which they illegally imported fuel to Malta.
According to Libyan media sources, the 400
tonnes of diesel on the ship cost around EUR
36 000 in Libya, whereas Maltese consumers would have to pay around EUR 620 000
for the same amount.

Figure 21. In April 2013, EU Counter-terrorism
Coordinator, Gilles de Kerchove, warned
that around 500 persons from EU countries
are already fighting with the insurgents

around 120 Germans joined the insurgency.
Authorities are striving to prevent potential
fighters from leaving the country and managed to convince around a dozen of them
to stay. A small number of German fighters
are known to have already returned to Germany, others have died in combat. One German national in Syria has recently called for
suicide attacks against civilians in his internet
video post. Although authorities are apparently not aware of any specific plans of returning foreign fighters to conduct attacks
within the EU, both their potential radicalisation and weapons and explosives training could make them a substantial threat in
their home country.

Turkey thwarts Belgians’ attempt to
join the fighting in Syria
Four Belgian citizens were returned to
Belgium in June 2013 after they were arrested by the Turkish Army before trying to illegally enter Syria. Would-be
foreign fighters probably entered Turkey legally via air or land routes and
then infiltrated into Syria.

Another law-enforcement operation in Q2
2013 revealed connections between the global
illicit drug trade and terrorism. The Spanish
newspaper El País reported in April that an
internationally coordinated police operation
showed a certain extent of cooperation between alleged members of the Revolutionary
Forces of Colombia (FARC) and Al Qaeda in
the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). In March, two

Colombian nationals were arrested in Algeria along with three alleged members of
AQIM. The Colombians, who later showed
to be affiliated to the FARC, were about to
deliver a shipment of cocaine. In exchange,
they would receive cash and arms deriving
from Libyan arsenals. According to the reports, the drugs were destined for the European market.

In Greece, the discontinuity between 2011 and 2012 is due to the introduction of reporting of counterfeit stamps used by Albanian nationals at the land border
between Greece and Albania.
Spain data include detections on entry, exit and transit.
2012 Q1 data for Sweden only include fraudulent documents detected in March.
Due to reporting and comparability issues data from France have been excluded from this table in 2012.

Frontex · FRAN Quarterly · q2 2013

Sources and Methods
For the data concerning detections at the external borders, some of the border types are
not applicable to all FRAN Member States.
This pertains to data on all FRAN indicators
since the data are provided disaggregated
by border type. The definitions of detections
at land borders are therefore not applicable (excluding borders with non-Schengen
principalities) for Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Iceland,
Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland and
the UK. For Cyprus, the land border refers to
the Green Line demarcation with the area
not under the effective control of the government of the Republic of Cyprus. For sea
borders, the definitions are not applicable for
land-locked Member States including Austria,
the Czech Republic, Hungary, Luxembourg,
Slovakia and Switzerland.
In addition, data on detections of illegal border-crossing at land, air and sea BCPs (1B) are
not available for Iceland, Ireland and Spain
and in Greece, these detections are included
in the data for Indicator 1A. Data for Norway only includes detections of illegal border-crossing at land and sea BCPs (1B), not
between BCPs (1A).
In Italy, detections of illegal border-crossing
at sea BCPs are only reported for intra-EU
border-crossing from Greece. Data on detections of illegal border-crossing between
sea BCPs (1A) are not available for Ireland.

64 of 64

Data on apprehension (FRAN Indicator 2) of
facilitators is not available for Ireland. For Italy, the data are not disaggregated by border
type, but are reported as total apprehensions (not specified). Data for Italy and Norway also include the facilitation of illegal stay
and work. For Romania, the data include
land intra-EU detections on exit at the border with Hungary.
For the data concerning detections of illegal
stay (FRAN Indicator 3), data on detections
at exit are not available for Denmark, Ireland,
Italy, Spain and the UK.
Data on refusals of entry (FRAN Indicator 4)
at the external EU borders are not disaggregated by reason of refusal for Ireland and
the UK. Refusals of entry at the Spanish land
borders at Ceuta and Melilla (without the issuance of a refusal form) are reported separately and are not included in the presented
FRAN data.
The data on applications for international
protection (FRAN Indicator 5) are not disaggregated by place of application (type of
border on entry or inland applications) for
Austria, the Czech Republic and Slovenia. For
these countries, only the total number of applications is reported. For France, only asylum applications at the external borders are
reported, not inland applications. For Switzerland, requests for asylum at the Swiss
Embassies abroad are also reported and considered as inland applications in the FRAN
data. For the UK, data reported for applications at air BCPs also include applications
at sea BCPs
