Frontex official publications fall into four main categories: risk analysis, training, operations
and research, each marked with a distinct graphic identifier. Risk analysis publications
bear a triangular symbol formed by an arrow drawing a triangle, with a dot at the centre.
Metaphorically, the arrow represents the cyclical nature of risk analysis processes and its
orientation towards an appropriate operational response. The triangle is a symbol of ideal
proportions and knowledge, reflecting the pursuit of factual exactness, truth and exhaustive
analysis. The dot at the centre represents the intelligence factor and the focal point where
information from diverse sources converges to be processed, systematised and shared as
analytical products. Thus, Frontex risk analysis is meant to be at the centre and to form
a reliable basis for its operational activities.

Executive summary
In Q1 2013 all indicators of irregular migration
and asylum exchanged under the FRAN and
EDF-RAN were reduced in comparison with
the final months of 2012. In most cases these
declines were interpreted as consistent with
the cycle of seasonal variation, whereby the
first few months of each year are usually associated with reduced pressure at the border compared to other times of the year. This
was especially true of asylum applications
that have declined by 12–24% at the beginning of each year since data collection began in 2008. Detections of document fraud
also showed signs of seasonal decrease, both
in terms of entry at the external border and
on intra-Schengen flights.
There were, however, two indicators that in
Q1 2013 showed signs of reductions in excess
of what would normally be expected based
on seasonal trends. Firstly, detections of migrants illegally staying in the EU were reduced, but this indicator has been in steady
decline from over 100 000 per quarter in the
beginning of 2009 to the lowest ever level of
77 000 in the current reporting period. Secondly, detections of illegal border-crossing
were much reduced following, among other
things, increased operational activity at the
external border, particularly in Greece.
The Greek operation Aspida, carried out at
the Greek-Turkish border, has had dramatic
and pervasive impact on both local and more
general irregular migration trends.
In the area of the operation, detections of irregular migrants decreased to a minimum.
Although some of this decline was due to seasonal variation, the operation is considered by
many sources to have effectively closed this
border section for irregular migrants. Other
factors that contributed to reducing detec-

tions in the area include the completion of a
border fence and the threat of longer detention times for detected migrants.
The operation has also forced the growing
number of migrants arriving in Turkey to
redirect to alternative routes, where normally they would crossed the land border to
Greece. Reports and data suggest that these
migrants, most of whom began to congregate in Istanbul, were offered three alternative modi operandi to enter the EU:
1.	Leaving the west coast of Turkey in small
boats to illegally cross the Eastern Aegean Sea to the Greek Islands: Syrians and
Afghans were both detected at similar
frequencies of around 500 each over the
three-month period.
2.	Illegally crossing the green border into
Bulgaria: detections of illegal bordercrossing at the Bulgarian land border with
Turkey began to increase almost immediately after the beginning of the Greek operation Aspida. In response, the Bulgarian
Border Guard Authority deployed a specialised police operation and enhanced
air surveillance at the Bulgarian-Turkish
land border, and they implemented an
Integrated Border Surveillance System
(IBSS) along the most affected part of the
border. Syrians were the most commonly
detected migrants at this border section,
with 279 detections.
3.	Purchasing fraudulent documents and
boarding flights from Istanbul to the EU:
since the beginning of the Greek operation Aspida, there has been an increase
in the number of migrants detected arriving on flights from Turkey using fraudulent documents, particularly Syrians as
well as other nationalities usually associated with illegal border-crossing to Greece
from Turkey.

The Greek operation Aspida has also changed
the extent and nature of document fraud used
at the external border and within the Schengen area. Before the operation, large numbers of migrants entered Greece from Turkey
and then used fraudulent documents to make
secondary movements on intra-Schengen
flights from Athens to final destination Member States. This flow was probably also underestimated because of the lack of systematic
checks and absence of border control on these
intra-Schengen flights. Since the operation
Aspida prevented large numbers of migrants
from reaching Athens, detections of document fraudsters arriving in the Schengen area
on flights from Athens has dropped by 50%.
Consistent with the theory that migrants were
congregating in Istanbul, detections on flights
from Istanbul more than doubled over the
same period. However, immediately subsequent to the reporting period there have been
reports of many migrants avoiding Istanbul
and instead heading straight to Izmir for immediate departure towards the Greek Islands.

August 2012; hence indicating that the journey takes on average at least eight months.
An alternative explanation is that these migrants were already illegally staying in Greece,
and left under increased pressure from the
Greek authorities, who have also been targeting migrant communities in Athens and
other urban areas.

The Western Balkans land route is another
way in which migrants who originally entered the Schengen area in Greece make secondary movements to their final destination
countries. Hence, given the pervasive effects
of the Greek operation Aspida, it would not
have been unreasonable to have foreseen
a reduction in pressure across the region,
particularly in terms of ‘long-distance’ nationalities normally associated with irregular
migration into Greece, such as Afghans, Pakistanis, Syrians and Algerians. However, according to data exchanged by the FRAN and
the WB-RAN, in Q1 2013 detections of illegal
border-crossing actually increased by 29% (to
8 500) compared with the same period in 2012,
with around two-thirds of detections being
migrants assumed to have first entered the
Schengen area in Greece. One potential explanation for the continued existence of this
flow is that these migrants may have entered
Greece before the operation Aspida started in

Also in Greece, but unrelated to the operation
Aspida, Albanians continued to feature highly
in several indicators of irregular migration. For
example, with more than 1 000 detections they
were the most commonly detected migrants illegally crossing the external land border, almost
exclusively to Greece but with a steady trend
compared to previous reporting periods. They
were also commonly detected as illegal stayers and they were refused entry to Greece in
significant but stable numbers. Albanians were
the second most common nationality detected
for document fraud on entry at the external
border from a third country. In this case they
were using counterfeit Greek border-crossing stamps at their land border with Greece in
order to fabricate travel histories and extend
periods of stay. Albanians were also detected
using forged and counterfeit Greek or Italian
ID cards in significant and increasing numbers
to attempt entry to the UK from the Schengen area, sometimes via Ireland.

The border section which reported most increases of irregular migration during the first
three months of 2013 was the Hungarian land
border with Serbia. In this location there was
a threefold increase in detections of illegal
border-crossing in Q1 2013 compared to the
same period in 2012. Most detections were
secondary movements of long-distance migrants from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Algeria
who originally entered the Schengen area in
Greece. However, the biggest increase was a
threefold rise in the number of detected Kosovo* citizens, and a corresponding eightfold
increase in their asylum applications in Hungary as a whole.

1. Introduction
FRAN Quarterly reports are prepared by the
Frontex Risk Analysis Unit (RAU) and provide
a regular overview of irregular migration at
the EU external borders, based on the irregular-migration data exchanged among Member State border-control authorities within
the cooperative framework of the Frontex
Risk Analysis Network (FRAN) and its subsidiary, the European Union Document-Fraud
Risk Analysis Network (EDF-RAN).
The main purpose of the FRAN Quarterlies
is to provide:
1.	feedback to the FRAN community in the
context of information exchange;
2.	a periodic update to the situational picture of irregular migration at the EU level;
and
3.	material for constructive discussion on reporting protocols and related trends and
patterns.
This report is intended to simultaneously
serve two objectives: first, to provide a clear
summary of the situation at the external border of the EU, and second, to serve as an archive for future reference and comparative
analyses. Consistent with standard archival
techniques, some information is repeated
among sections to serve as context.

Harmonising complex, multi-source migration
data among Frontex and Member States is an
ongoing process. Therefore some of the more
detailed data and trends in this report should
be interpreted with caution and, where possible, cross-referenced with information from
other sources. The statistics should be understood in the context of the different levels of
passenger flows passing through different
border sections, the activities undertaken by
Member State border-control authorities to
secure different border sections and widespread variation in reporting and data-collection practices.
FRAN Members and Member State risk analysis experts and border-control authorities are
considered the primary customers of these
reports. In addition to the discussions taking
place during FRAN meetings, Member State
experts are invited and actively encouraged
to examine and comment upon the data and
analyses presented here. Despite all efforts
of RAU and Member State experts involved
in data exchange and analyses, it is conceivable that minor errors will occur in these reports due to very challenging timelines, and
the growing volume and complexity of data
and other information exchanged within the
FRAN community.

2. Methodology
The present 19th issue of the FRAN Quarterly
is a comparative analysis of FRAN data collected between January and March 2012, and
exchanged between 30 Member State border-control authorities within the framework
of the FRAN. The report presents the results
of statistical analysis of quarterly variations in
eight irregular-migration indicators and one
asylum indicator, aggregated at the level of
the event. Bi-monthly analytical reports exchanged by Member States were also used
for interpretative purposes and to provide
qualitative information, as were other available sources of information such as Frontex
Joint Operations.
Precise definitions of Indicators 1 to 6, aimed
at harmonising the data exchanged at EU
level, were presented in the annexes of the
Q1 and Q2 reports in 2009 and so are not repeated here.

During the June 2010 FRAN Meeting, a proposal for a harmonised definition of the
return indicator was outlined and several
questions were presented in order to motivate discussion among FRAN Members in
view of establishing the regular collection
of monthly return data by Frontex. Subsequently, an online survey of FRAN Members
was conducted to gather information and
further motivate discussion to fine-tune the
proposal for the indicator. The 11th FRAN report (Q1 2011) was the first to include analysis
of Indicators 7A and 7B, and the definitions
of these indicators are included in an annex
to that report. Data collection commenced
in January 2011.
The FRAN data-exchange has been in place
since September 2007. Data are exchanged
through the ICONet Internet platform, an interest group of the European Commission’s

CIRCA server. Member State monthly data
are based on a country template prepared by
the Frontex Risk Analysis Unit. The deadline
for submitting data for each month is the
25th day of the subsequent month, with the
exception of the end of year data which are
requested by 15 January each year. For this
19th issue of the FRAN Quarterly, the target
for Member States to upload the monthly
data was thus 15 April 2013. In principle, data
submitted subsequent to this date will be
reflected in the next FRAN Quarterly, except
in cases where clarification is needed in order to proceed with comprehensive analysis.
Following the closure of the CIREFI working group in April 2010, most of its mandates
and, of particular relevance, the exchange of
data were transferred to the FRAN. Fortunately, most CIREFI indicators already overlapped with the monthly data exchange of
FRAN members. The exception was the indicator on returns, which was added as part of
the regular data exchange within the FRAN
at the beginning of 2011.
In January 2012 the European Union Document-Fraud Risk Analysis Network (EDFRAN) was formed as a specialist forum to
oversee the exchange and analyses of detections of document fraud to illegally cross
the external borders, and on all international
flights. Data were backdated and joined with
those exchanged under a pilot Tailored Risk
Analysis released in 2011.*
The EDF-RAN data are checked for inconsistencies, and corrections are made to reported totals to bring them in line with
reported breakdowns. Corrections are also
made to any three-letter nationality codes
not present in the reference ISO list of nationality codes.**

External borders refer to the borders between Member States and third countries.
The borders between the Schengen Associated Countries (Norway, Iceland and
Switzerland) and third countries are also
considered as external borders. The borders between the Schengen Associated
Countries and Schengen Member States
are considered as internal borders. For the
indicators on detections of facilitators, illegal stay and asylum, statistics are also
reported for detections at the land borders
between the Schengen Member States
and Schengen candidates (Bulgaria, Romania) or non-Schengen Member States
(the UK, Ireland), so that a total for Member States and the Schengen Associated
Countries as a whole can be presented. It
was not possible to make this distinction
for air and sea borders because Member
States do not habitually differentiate between extra-EU and intra-EU air and sea
connections but tend to aggregate data
for all arrivals.
When data are examined at the level of
third-country nationalities, a large percentage usually falls under the category ‘Other
(not specified)’ or ‘Unknown’. It is expected
that the percentage reported under these
categories will decrease with time as Member States improve the quality and speed
of their identification, data collection and
reporting practices; nationalities are often
reported as ‘Unknown’ if an individual’s nationality cannot be established before reports are submitted.
This issue of the FRAN Quarterly also includes main findings of Frontex-coordinated
Joint Operations active for at least a proportion of Q1 2013. Namely, for sea borders they
were JO Poseidon Sea 2012 and JO Hermes
2012, for land borders – JO Poseidon Land
2012 and 2013 and JO Focal Points Land 2012;
for the air border – JO Focal Points Air 2012
and 2013.

Monthly data on the following indicators were exchanged
among the FRAN community:
1A detections of illegal border-crossing between BCPs
1B detections of illegal border-crossing at BCPs
2 detections of suspected facilitators
3 detections of illegal stay
4 refusals of entry
5 asylum applications
6 document fraud (EDF-RAN)
7A return decisions for illegally staying third-country nationals
7B	effective returns of illegally staying third-country nationals
FRAN and EDF-RAN data used in the tables and charts are as of 21 May 2013

Both primary data sources, such as interviews
with irregular migrants, and secondary data
sources, such as reports of intelligence analysts, daily reports of deployed officers and
analytical products (weekly and bi-weekly
analytical reports for each abovementioned
operation), were used to provide an exhaustive overview of the situation at the external
borders of the EU. Additionally, open source
data were researched as background information for the present analysis.
Acknowledgements
The Frontex Risk Analysis Unit would like to
express thanks to all FRAN and EDF-RAN
Members and their associates in Member
State statistical, migration and document
fraud units who collect, aggregate and exchange monthly data, and the analysts who
compile the bi-monthly analytical reports
on which much of the detailed analyses presented here are based.
We are also grateful to Member State representatives who responded to requests for
additional information on key topics and
emerging trends (e.g. Hungary).

n	Overall irregular migration was at a reduced level during the first three months
of 2013, mostly following increased operational activity at the external border
combined with some foreseen seasonal
declines.
n	During Q1 2013 all FRAN and EDF-RAN indicators decreased compared to the previous reporting period.
n	There were fewer detections of illegal
stay than ever before, which is consistent with long-term declines in reports of
this indicator.
n	There were fewer detections of illegal
border-crossing than ever before, with
just 9 717 detections. The drop was limited mostly to sea borders.
n	At the external land border, detections of
illegal border-crossing actually increased
compared with the previous quarter.
n	Most of the major routes of irregular migration reported low levels of detections,
but there were increased detections on
the Western Balkans route.
n	Following a threefold increase compared
to Q4 2012, in Q1 2013 the land border between Hungary and Serbia reported more
detections of illegal border-crossing than
any other border section.
n	Overall, migrants from Syria were the nationality most commonly detected illegally
crossing the external border.
n	Migrants from Mali, the Gambia, Kosovo*,
and Syria were increasingly detected illegally crossing the external border.
n	Albanians detected illegally crossing their
land border into Greece was the largest
single phenomenon in Q1 2013, followed
by Kosovo* citizens at the Hungarian land
border with Serbia.

n	There was increased operational activity
across the Eastern Mediterranean region,
including:
1.	The Greek operation Aspida at the land
border with Turkey;
2.	Frontex JOs Poseidon Land and Sea at
the borders with Turkey;
3.	Bulgarian specialised police operation
at their land border with Turkey.
n	At the Greek land border with Turkey,
which was the undisputed hotspot during
the first half of 2012, detections of illegal
border-crossing were at almost negligible levels.
n	Weak displacement effects from Greek
land border with Turkey were reported
as increased detections of:
1.	illegal border-crossing at the Bulgarian land border with Turkey, where
migrants and facilitators were increasingly detected;
2.	migrants leaving the west coast of Turkey to illegally cross the Eastern Aegean Sea towards the Greek Islands.
This border section ranked second at
the EU level in terms of detections;
3.	document fraudsters on flights from
Turkey to Schengen airports, often using authentic Swedish passports.
n	Secondary movements of many nationalities were still detected across the Western Balkans in substantial numbers.
n	Hungary reported huge increases in the
number of asylum applications submitted
by Afghans, Kosovo* citizens, Pakistanis
and Algerians.
n	In Greece, Albanians continued to be reported at high levels among several different indicators in terms of document
fraud, illegal border-crossing, illegal stay
and refusals of entry.

n	Albanians were also the nationality most
associated with document fraud both on
entry at their land border with Greece
(counterfeit stamps) and while attempting entry to the UK from the Schengen
area, sometimes via Ireland (ID cards).
n	In Q1 2013 Slovenia began to refuse entry
to the Schengen area to large numbers of
Croatians for a wide range of reasons not
directly linked to irregular migration, including lack of valid documents.

4.1. Detections of illegal
border-crossing
Overall in Q1 2013 there were 9 717 detections of illegal border-crossing at the EU level,
which was by far the lowest figure since data
collection began in early 2008. In comparative terms, this figure represents a decrease
of 26% compared to the previous quarter,
but a reduction of two-thirds since the same
quarter in 2012.
The low number of detections compared
to other quarters was almost exclusively
due to vastly increased operational activity at the Greek land border with Turkey,
where in recent years the majority of migrants were detected (operation Aspida,
see next section).
The following is a list of top reporting border sections with an indication of the most
commonly reported nationalities:
1.	Land border between Hungary and Serbia,
where a wide range of nationalities were
increasingly detected such as Kosovo* citizens, Afghans, and Pakistanis;
2.	The Greek Aegean Sea to where Afghans
and Syrians were increasingly displaced
from the Greek land border with Turkey;
3.	The Greek land border with Albania with
a significant trend of Albanian circular
migrants;
4.	
T he Bulgarian land border with Turkey, where Palestinians and Syrians, and

more recently Malians were increasingly
detected;
5.	The Spanish land border with Morocco,
where there was a steady trend of unknown nationalities (probably sub-Saharans) and Algerians.
4.1.1. Operational activity in Eastern
Mediterranean region
During the reporting period in the Eastern
Mediterranean region there were three significant sources of operational activity which
produced several knock-on effects in other
regions. The operational activities were as
follows:
1.	The Greek land border with Turkey has
been a major hotspot for irregular migration for several years. However, in August
2012 the Greek authorities launched the
operation Aspida, deploying additional
manpower, assets and equipment to the
Evros region in order to curb the flow of
illegal border-crossing.
	The enhanced surveillance and patrolling
activities resulted in a drastic drop in the
number of detections of illegal bordercrossing in at the Greek land border with
Turkey. In addition to the operation Aspida, the operation Xenios Zeus focused on
detecting migrants inland in urban areas
around Athens.
2.	Immediately after the deployment of
the operation Aspida detections of illegal border-crossing at the Bulgarian land
border with Turkey began to increase, indicating a weak displacement from the
operational area. As a response to the
increasing migration pressure, the Bulgarian Border Guard Authority deployed
additional officers, patrol cars and service dogs along the Bulgarian-Turkish
border.

	A specialised police operation in some areas of the Bulgarian-Turkish land border,
and enhanced air surveillance have been
ongoing since 1 October 2012. In addition,
since 1 July 2012, the Bulgarian authorities
have implemented an Integrated Border
Surveillance System (IBSS)* at the border. It covers the most affected section of
the Bulgarian-Turkish land border. Regular bilateral joint meetings for preventing and resolving border incidents take
place under the Agreement signed between Bulgaria and Turkey.
3.	The JO Poseidon Land 2012 was active
during Q1 2013. The JO Poseidon Sea 2012
was also active during the reporting period in order to tackle the flow of irregular migrants penetrating the external
EU sea borders in the Eastern Mediterranean mainly from Turkey and, to a lesser
extent, from Egypt.
4.1.2. EU Summaries
While useful for summary purposes, EU-level
figures conceal considerable variation within
and among Member States, nationalities and
the major irregular-migration routes. For
example, in contrast to the overall decline
and the fact that in Q1 2013 there were fewer
detections of illegal border-crossing than in
any previous quarter since data collection
began, at a wide range of border sections
detections of illegal border-crossing actually increased. This was particularly the case
for the Hungarian land border with Serbia.
Hence, the overall decrease compared to a
year previously was driven almost entirely
by far fewer (-67%) detections at the Greek
land border with Turkey.
Despite this huge decrease, in Q1 2013
Greece still reported more detections of illegal border-crossing than any other Member State, with just over half reported from
the Eastern Aegean Sea and a third from

14 of 60

the Greek land border with Albania. Hungary ranked second among Member States
for the first time data collection began in
2008 following a threefold increase compared to the same period in 2012, in Q1 2013.
Italy ranked third and continued to report
a significant but steady trend of detections
compared to a year previously.
Figure 2 shows the evolution of the FRAN
Indicator 1A – detections of illegal border-crossing, and the proportion of detections between the land and sea borders of
the EU per quarter since the beginning of
2008. The first quarter of each year is usually influenced by weather conditions less
favourable for both approaching and illegally crossing the external border of the EU.
Correspondingly, poor conditions for illegal
border-crossing also render it more difficult
to detect such attempts. The combination
of these two effects means that the first
quarter of each year has usually been associated with fewer detections than during
the summer months.
There were barely more than 6 000 detections at the external land border which is
nearly a 50% reduction compared to a year
previously, but is actually a small increase
compared to the previous quarter (Fig. 2).
Increased detections at the external land
border were due to more Asian, North African and Western Balkan nationals attempting to illegally crossing the land border into
Hungary from Serbia. As a result of this increase, in Q1 2013 the land border between
Hungary and Serbia was the border section
that reported the most detections of illegal
border-crossing.
In Q1 2013, detections were particularly
low when compared both with the final
quarter of 2012 and the first quarters of
previous years. The former comparison
is explained by the Greek operation Aspida reducing detections at the Greek land

Figure 2. I n Q1 2013 there were fewer detections of illegal border-crossing than during any

border with Turkey, while the longer-term
decline has more to do with the absence
in early 2013 of two disparate but overlapping phenomena:
I.	The flow of Albanian circular migrants
to Greece was reduced by ~85% in 2011
and 2012, since Albanians were granted
visa-free access to the Schengen area in
late 2010;
II.	In 2011 there was a temporary surge of
illegal border-crossing in response to the
Arab Spring uprising in several North African countries.
Migrants from Syria (1 248) were the most
commonly detected migrants attempting to
illegally cross the external border. Detections
of migrants from Syria increased throughout
2012, but there was a steady decline between
the final quarter of 2012 and the first quarter
of 2013. This is the first time since the Arab
Spring that migrants from Afghanistan were
not the most commonly detected migrants.
In fact, in Q1 2013 migrants from Afghanistan ranked third at the EU level with half the
number of detections compared to the same
period in 2012 (1 082 compared with 2 543).

The migrants that were detected in the most
increased frequencies compared to the same
period in 2012 were from Kosovo* (+190% to
588), Mali (+1 316% to 354) and the Gambia
(+721% to 279).
The 9 717 detections of illegal border-crossing in Q1 2013 were the result of combined
detections in 14 Member States, many
of which experienced differing trends.

detections of illegal border-crossing among
ten Member States during the first quarters
of both 2011 and 2012 (size of circles), and also
the degree of change between the two reporting periods (slopes). Despite a decrease
of two-thirds, Greece still reported the most
detections of illegal border-crossing, but several Member States reported very significant
increases (e.g. Estonia, Bulgaria and Hungary).

Serbia, which explains the decrease compared to a year previously (Fig. 3). The decrease compared to the previous quarter
was due to nearly a complete absence of
migrants from Pakistan, Algeria, and Bangladesh at the land border with Serbia, and
migrants from Ukraine and Moldova at the
land border with Moldova.
Apart from analysing the changes in terms
of Member State distributions, it is also informative to consider these trends by nationality of migrants. Figure 4 illustrates
the number of detections of illegal bordercrossing of the top ten nationalities during
the first quarters of 2012 and 2013 (size of
circles) and the degree of change between
these reporting periods (slopes).
A large number of nationalities were detected in smaller numbers in Q1 2013 than
a year previously in Q1 2012, mostly because
of increased operational activity in Greece
that resulted in fewer detections at the
Greek land border with Turkey. These nationalities, some of which are illustrated in
Figure 4, included Afghans, Bangladeshis,
Algerians, Pakistanis and Somalis.
In contrast to these widespread declines,
some migrants were detected in much
higher numbers in Q1 2013 than in Q1 2012
(Fig. 4). Most notably Syrians, were increasingly detected at the Greek sea border with
Turkey (Eastern Aegean Sea) and the Bulgarian land border with Turkey, while Kosovo* citizens were increasingly detected
at the Hungarian land border with Serbia.
To a lesser degree, but still significant at the
EU level were increased detections of Malians at a range of border sections including
the Bulgarian land border with Turkey and
also the Hungarian land border with Serbia
and the Spanish sea border at Cadiz. Gambians were also increasingly detected compared to same period in 2012, in this case

they were almost exclusively detected in
the Italian Pelagic Islands.
Data received within FRAN show the extent
of the displacement effects from the Greek
land border with Turkey following operational activity in the area. For example, in
the East Aegean Sea migrants from Syria,
Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and Palestine were
all increasingly detected compared to the
same period in 2012, well before the Greek
operation Aspida. Also the Bulgarian land
border with Turkey has reported increased
detections, but in this case of Syrians, Malians and Palestinians.
Also apparent from FRAN figures is the way
in which the Hungarian land border with
Serbia became increasingly important compared to the first quarter of 2013. The nationalities detected at this border section
are comparable to those associated with
the Eastern Mediterranean region and so
are probably migrants that were making
secondary movements across the Western
Balkans. The exception was Kosovo* citizens, now the third most detected nationality at the external land border. According
to some reports they are exploiting a change
of asylum legislation in Hungary (see Section 4.7. Asylum claims).

4.2. Routes

without prejudice to
positions on status,
and is in line with
UNSCR 1244 and the

For more detailed analyses detections of illegal border-crossing are frequently classified
into major irregular migration routes, relating to regions of detection rather than linear
routes taken. As illustrated in Figure 5, during the first quarter of 2013 detections of illegal border-crossing on the main irregular
migration routes converged to very similar
levels with less than 2 000 detections separating the top five routes.
In the Eastern Mediterranean, detections
tend to be characterised by Asian and some

North African migrants illegally crossing the
border from Turkey into Greece. In the second
half of 2012 detections were much reduced
following increased operational activity at the
Greek land border with Turkey, where most
detections were previously reported (see Section 4.1.1.). In response, detections increased
elsewhere in the region yet to a much lesser
extent, resulting in a sustained low level of
detections between the final quarter of 2012
and the first three months of 2013 (Fig. 5).
On the main Central Mediterranean route,
which includes the Italian Pelagic Islands (Linosa, Lampione and Lampedusa) and Malta,
most detections tend to be of migrants arriving on boats from North Africa. During
the previous quarter there were fewer detections of North African nationalities such
as Tunisians and Egyptians but there was a
surge of migrants from sub-Saharan countries such as Eritrea, the Gambia and Mali,
all of which were detected in much higher
numbers during the last there months of
2012 compared with Q3 2012. In the current
reporting period, the number of detected Somalis decreased, resulting in the top three nationalities – Somalis, Gambians and Egyptians

2012 Q3

2012 Q4

2013 Q1

– being detected at similarly low levels of
around 200–250 each over the three-month
period (Fig. 5).
In contrast to the overall decline, detections
on the Western Balkans route increased from
less than 1 500 in Q4 2012 to more than 2 500
in Q1 2013. This was because of a wide range
of nationalities that were detected increasingly attempting to enter Hungary from Serbia,
with Kosovo* citizens now ranked top among
all nationalities.
4.2.1. Eastern Mediterranean route
Since data collection began in early 2008,
the Eastern Mediterranean has maintained
its status as a major hotspot of irregular migration into the Schengen area, mostly associated with illegal border-crossing from
Turkey. However, since early August 2012
detections on this route have been at much
lower levels following the deployment of
the Greek operation Aspida at the Greek
land border with Turkey (see Section 4.1.1.).
In Q1 2013 there were 2 734 detections of illegal border-crossing on the Eastern Med-

Figure 6. Following the August 2012 launch of the Greek operation Aspida at the Greek land

iterranean route, which was a decrease of
66% compared to the same period in 2012
but nevertheless still constituting nearly
30% of all detections at the EU level. In effect, this route remained the major entry
point to the Schengen area.
With nearly 1 000 detections in Q1 2013, Syrians were by far the most detected nationality on this route. More than half of these
detections were in the Eastern Aegean Sea
region, with significant numbers also at the
Bulgarian land border with Turkey.
For much of the last few years migrants from
Afghanistan have been detected in very high
numbers on the Eastern Mediterranean route;
in Q1 2013 just 500 were detected although
they were still the second most commonly
detected nationality on this route. Migrants
from Sri Lanka (173) and Mali (120) were detected in much higher numbers than ever
before on this route.
Greek land border with Turkey
During the first half of 2012, the Greek land
border with Turkey was the undisputed

2012 Q1

2012 Q2

2012 Q3

2012 Q4

2013 Q1

2012

hotspot for illegal border-crossing into the
Schengen area. However, in Q1 2013 detections at the Greek land border with Turkey
were much reduced following the August
2012 launch of the Greek operation Aspida. Syrians were the most commonly detected nationality of migrants along this
border section.
During much of February 2013 the water
level in and around the Evros River was
also extremely high, which made many areas almost impassable. As a result detections of illegal border-crossing were even
lower than expected.
Displacement effects
Although the Greek land border with Turkey
is viewed by many as having been effectively
closed by the Greek operation Aspida, there
is no evidence to suggest that fewer migrants
arrive in the region hoping to cross the external border of the EU. Once in Turkey instead of heading to the Greek land border,
many migrants are thought to be offered
three main choices of how to proceed to the
external border of the EU:

19 of 60

Frontex · FRAN Quarterly · q1 2013

1.	To cross the Bulgarian land border with
Turkey on foot
2.	Small boats departing from the East Aegean Sea
3.	Flights from Istanbul to the EU with fraudulent documents

The JO Poseidon Sea 2012 was operational
throughout the reporting period, focusing
on tackling the flow of irregular migrants
penetrating the external EU sea borders
in the Eastern Mediterranean mainly from
Turkey and, to a lesser extent, from Egypt.

1. Bulgarian land border with Turkey

Syrians have been the most commonly detected migrants during the operation so far
in 2013. Most were men travelling alone but
here were some family units, and all were
heading for Sweden or Germany to claim asylum. Once they entered Turkey, those intending to enter the EU travelled to Istanbul in
order to make contact with facilitation networks. They stayed in Istanbul for between
1–12 weeks before being taken by van to the
west coast of Turkey to depart towards the
Greek eastern Aegean Islands.

Detections at the Bulgarian land border with
Turkey began to increase almost immediately after the beginning of the Greek operation Aspida. Syrians were also the most
commonly detected migrants at this border section, although some of them may be
other nationalities claiming to be Syrian to
increase their chances of being granted international protection.
The interviews carried out with migrants
apprehended in the Bulgarian operational
area lead to the conclusion that most
crossed the land border with the help of
local residents from the area of Edirne who
were either working for the facilitation networks based in Istanbul or were just working on their own.
Migrants tended to arrive in Edirne using
either public transport or means of transport provided by facilitators, and then they
were handed over to the local smugglers
with experience in facilitating the bordercrossing. Many were instructed to claim
false nationalities in order to inhibit accurate data entry into EURODAC. Nevertheless, their fingerprints were recorded
electronically and sent to the EURODAC
database.
2. East Aegean Sea
This border section ranked second at the
EU level in Q1 2013. The most frequently detected migrants were Syrians and Afghans,
followed Sri Lankans, whose number has recently increased.

20 of 60

Afghans were also detected in this region.
Most were previously resident in Iran and
had decided to travel to the EU due to deteriorating employment conditions. The
Afghan community in Iran can easily find
criminal networks that can facilitate them
to Turkey and then to Greece. Once in Turkey, the Afghan migrants were transported
by public transport to Istanbul and from
there mainly by private transportation directly to departure area on the western
coast of Turkey, where they boarded rubber boats destined for the Greek eastern
Aegean Islands.
3. Flights from Turkey
Since the beginning of the Greek operation
Aspida, there has been an increase in the
number of migrants detected arriving on
flights from Turkey using fraudulent documents, particularly Syrians as well as other
nationalities usually associated with illegal
border-crossing into Greece from Turkey.
These included Iranians, Afghans, Iraqis and
Algerians, all of whom were detected more
frequently than ever before on flights from

4.2.2. Central Mediterranean route

According to FRAN data, in Q1 2013 there
were just 1 124 reported detections of illegal
border-crossing on the main Central Mediterranean route (Italian Pelagic Islands, Sicily and Malta), which was about 30% of the
detections during the previous quarter but
a slight increase compared to a year previously in Q1 2012 (928). However, this figure concealed seasonal decreases for some
commonly detected nationalities and significant increases for others, and across the
region it is widely accepted that detections
are likely to increase with the onset of less
inclement weather.

Irregular migration in the Central Mediterranean increased massively back in 2011, largely
due to the political and civil unrest across
North Africa, particularly in Tunisia and Libya.
Since the end of that year, irregular migration
in the region has been more stable, especially
following reinstated cooperation between
Italian and Tunisian authorities concerning
the return of Tunisian nationals.

Since early 2011 migrants from Tunisia have
been among the most commonly detected
migrants arriving in the Central Mediterranean region but during the first three
months of 2013 only 75 Tunisians were detected. In fact nearly all of the top 10 nationalities in Q1 2013 were detected in much
lower numbers than during the final quarter of 2012.

Figure 7 shows the number of detections of
document fraudsters arriving in all Member
States/Schengen Associated Countries during each quarter since the beginning of 2011,
according to data exchanged under the EDFRAN. Clearly the number of detections nearly
doubled between the third and fourth quarters
of 2012, coinciding exactly with the launch of
the Greek operation Aspida (see Section 4.1.1.).

For example, on 9 May, the Italian authorities
were informed by telephone that a migrant
boat had departed from Libya towards Italy.
A costal patrol vessel from Lampedusa intercepted the boat and took all 98 migrants,
most of whom were from Somalia or Eritrea, onboard.

Fewer Migrants to the
Canaries
[In February 2013] Spanish Minister
Jorge Fernández said that the government has classified traffic to the
islands from Africa as virtually non-existent due to the sharp decline in the
number of boats and migrants in recent years. Last year saw just 173 Africans land by boat in the Canaries, a
fall of 50% compared to the previous
year and a tiny fraction of the 31 000
who landed in 2006 at the height of
the cayuco (wooden boat) crisis that
stretched the emergency services and
migrant holding centres to breaking
point. Despite the positive news, experts say the authorities should not
eliminate surveillance of the region’s
waters in order not to encourage the
traffickers to focus their attention on
the Canaries once again.

10 February 2013

Migrants from Somalia ranked top in the region but were detected at their lowest level
for over a year (271). However, subsequent
to the reporting period there was some evidence to suggest that the Somalis had once
again become the most detected nationality of migrants in the Central Mediterranean.

22 of 60

A total of 233 migrants from the Gambia were
detected in the Central Mediterranean during Q1 2013 which is the highest ever level for
this nationality resulting in them ranking second in this region, followed by 216 Egyptians.
The JO Hermes 2012 was operational just for
the first month of the reporting period. The
operation was established to support the
Italian authorities in tackling maritime illegal migration on the coasts of Sicily, Pantelleria and the Pelagic Islands (Lampedusa,
Linosa, Lampione).
In January 2013, there was only one incident
reported under JO Hermes whereby a total of 35 irregular migrants were detected,
32 of which were Syrian and three were
Egyptian. No facilitators were arrested. The
vessel with crew and some migrants had
departed from Alexandria (Egypt) with a
stopover near Crete, Greece, where some
migrants disembarked, and others (in this
case the Syrians) joined them to sail as far
as Sicily. The disembarkation point was
near Syracuse but this time the interception took place inland, implying that the
facilitators (and probably some migrants)
evaded detection.
The absence of boats from Tunisia and Libya
may be due to the bad weather conditions
throughout the Mediterranean area.
Although FRAN data suggest that detections
of migrants from Syria were low in this region during the first three months of 2013
(85), there were some reports of boats arriving directly from Syria. They started they

journey from the coast of Syria, organised by
Egyptian facilitators claimed to depart from
the Turkish coast near the border with Syria
(İskenderun) onboard 8-metre Egyptian vessels. They often changed vessels out at sea
(always coordinated by the Egyptian facilitators) before reaching the Italian coast after around 10 days. Some claimed to have
been contacted by a Syrian facilitator part
of a criminal organisation which organises
and recruits people in Syria to reach Italy for
EUR 5 000 each.
4.2.3. Western Mediterranean route
In Q1 2013 there were only around 1 000
detections of illegal border-crossing in the
Western Mediterranean region, which consists of several areas of the southern Spanish
coast as well as the land borders of Ceuta
and Melilla, where three-quarters of all detections were reported. At the end of 2012
we reported vastly increased detections
of migrants from Chad, Cameroon, Mali
and Guinea arriving in the region of Cadiz
but this did not continue into the first few
months of 2013.
Analysing the nationalities detected on this
route is problematic as half were reported
by the Spanish authorities as being of unknown nationality. However, open sources
suggest that there have been increased reports of African migrants storming the border fence in Melilla.
4.2.4. Western African route
In the first quarter of 2013, there were just
a few individual detections of illegal bordercrossing in this region, which is the same
level as during the same period in 2012. During the previous quarter there were 30 or
so detections of both Gambians and Moroccans but neither of these nationalities
were apparent in the data exchanged for
the first three months of 2013. Hence irreg-

ular migration pressure on the Western African route in much reduced.
4.2.5. Eastern land borders route
The eastern land borders route is, in effect,
an amalgam of detections of illegal bordercrossing reported by Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and
Romania. Despite the total length of all the
border sections, detections tend to be lower
than on other routes, possibly due to the long
distances between major hubs and many
countries of origin. Also according to several bi-monthly analytical reports shared
throughout 2012 and during early 2013, visa
fraud and counterfeit border-crossing stamps
tend to predominate on this route, as opposed
to detections of illegal border-crossing (see
Section 4.8. Document fraud).
In Q1 2013, there were just 220 detections of
illegal border-crossing at the eastern land
borders of the EU, which was lower than the
previous quarter but stable compared to a
year previously. However, this stable trend
in total numbers conceals much variation
between nationalities over the last year. For
example, there was a sharp increase in detections of migrants from the Russian Federation, but fewer detections of nationalities
from further afield such as Afghanistan and
Bangladesh.
Estonia reported by far the most detections
on this route mostly of Russians and Vietnamese migrants at the land border with the
Russian Federation, but also with a significant proportion of unknown nationalities.
4.2.6. Western Balkans route
There were almost 8 500 detections of illegal border-crossing between BCPs (green
borders) reported by Western Balkan countries and neighbouring Member States. Unsurprisingly, the number is one-fifth (21%)

23 of 60

and the ICJ Opinion on

independence

lower compared to the previous quarter and
thus in line with the regular seasonal variation. There were, however, significant differences between trends reported by Member
States and Western Balkan countries. Hungary, for example, reported a sharp 165% increase compared to the last quarter of 2012,
while the number of cases reported by Serbia
dropped by 41% in relation to the last three
months of 2012.
When 8 500 detections are compared to
the same period in 2012, a clear increasing
trend emerges with almost a third more cases
(29%). While the Hungary-Serbia border was
once again first among regional border sections, relative increases were the highest in
the case of the Serbia-Croatia (192%) and Croatia-Slovenia (192%) borders. The shift back
to the Hungary-Serbia border is most likely
linked to legislative changes in Hungary regarding detention of migrants (see box in
Section 4.7. Asylum claims).
In terms of nationalities, roughly two-thirds
of all detections (over 5 900) continued to be
associated with migrants who had entered
the Western Balkans en route from Greece
(i.e. Afghans, Pakistanis, Syrians, Algerians,
Somalis and Eritreans), although the detections of all these nationalities combined
decreased in comparison with the previous
quarter. For example, the trend of Syrian nationals constantly increasing during the past
three quarters did not continue in the first
quarter of 2013. Nevertheless, the number
of detection was still quite substantial at
767 cases. Detections of Afghans also declined, both compared to the corresponding quarter in 2012 (-23%) and the previous
three months (-33%).
On the other hand, detections of claimed Malian nationals increased to 258, or 231% more
in comparison with the previous quarter.
Most of these detections were made at the
borders between the former Yugoslav Re-

24 of 60

public of Macedonia and Serbia, and Serbia
and Hungary. However, it should be stressed
that false claims of nationality (e.g. nationality swapping) may partly explain this trend.
Detections of Western Balkan nationals remained relatively stable, Albanians being the
top detected nationality (1 475). However, detections of persons from the territory of Kosovo* continued to increase and were 58%
higher compared to the last quarter of 2012.
The detections were mostly made at the Hungary-Serbia border, where Kosovo* citizens
became the single largest group of detected
migrants (a 19% share of the total).
The above observations would indicate the
existence of a time lag of at least six months
between developments at the Greek-Turkish
borders and secondary movements through
the Western Balkans. More precisely, the
Greek operations Xenios Zeus and Aspida,
which resulted in a precipitous drop in the
numbers of detections at the Greek-Turkish
land border, have not yet had the expected
corresponding impact on detections in the
Western Balkans. However, there are some
early signs of this knock-on effect taking
place (e.g. decline in the number of Syrians
and Afghans).
Hiding in vehicles
Detections of migrants hiding in vehicles increased markedly compared with the corresponding quarter of 2012 (+78%). More
precisely, there were 708 migrants detected
trying to illegally cross the border at BCPs,
mostly reported by Serbia (a 33% share), followed by Croatia and the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia.
However, trends within the region were
mixed. The most notable change was a sharp
increase of detections at the border section
between the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia and Greece. This border became

the top reporting section with a 19% share
of the regional total.
This extraordinary increase of detections
reported exclusively by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (no detections
by Greek authorities) can be explained by
enhanced efforts of border authorities to
detect migrants, especially in trains. The
rather impressive results of the increased
activities probably had an impact on detections at other border sections along
this route.
In any case, the flow of migrants travelling
by train from Greece towards the Western
Balkan countries is probably substantially
larger than the current figures of detections
indicate. This assumption may be further
corroborated by other observations in the
northern part of the region – for example
Slovenia reporting a rising trend in the use
of cargo trains in clandestine border crossings. There are cases where irregular migrants have hidden even among potentially
dangerous cargo (e.g. metal waste).
Regardless of their declining numbers
(similar to green borders), Afghans remained the top detected nationality with
a 17% share (120) with Syrians coming second with a 12% share (83). As in the case
of green borders, detections of West Africans, such as claimed Malian and Ivorian
nationals, rose compared to the previous
quarter (from 12 to 40 and from 3 to 28,
respectively).

4.3. Clandestine entry
Restricting the FRAN indicator on detections of illegal border-crossing at BCPs
(1B) to the external land and sea borders
of the EU and to detections confirmed to
be clandestine entries (e.g. hiding in means
of transport), results in extremely low detections for the whole of the EU especially

compared with other indicators, such as
detections of illegal border-crossing between BCPs. For example, in Q1 2013 only
130 detections were reported from the
whole FR AN community (but see Section 4.2.6. Western Balkans route). Despite steady increases in this indicator
throughout 2012, this figure was actually a reduction compared to the previous
quarter (203) and also to the first quarter of 2012 (103).
In the case of Slovenia, from where most
detections were reported in each quarter for the last year, most detections were
of Afghan migrants increasingly detected
at the border with Croatia. Nearly all of
these Afghan migrants were making secondary movements after initially entering
the Schengen area in Greece (see Section
4.2.6. Western Balkans route). In Bulgaria
the increased detections of clandestine
entries at BCPs were due to more migrants from Syria, who were increasingly
detected at the land border with Turkey
– probably as a displacement effect from
the Greek land border with Turkey.
In contrast to the low number of detections
of clandestine entry at the external border,
there were more detections within the EU/
Schengen area (405). Although higher than
for the external border, this figure was a
reduction of around 15% compared to the
previous quarter. The geographical distribution of these ‘internal’ detections sheds
important light on the direction of secondary movements and the final destination countries selected by each nationality.
For example, the UK and Italy reported the
greatest number of internally detected clandestine irregular migrants. The most significant trends were Albanians detected
attempting entry to the UK (probably at
the ferry connections and channel tunnel),
and fewer Afghans arriving in Ancona, Italy, hidden on ferries from Greece.

Detections of facilitators

Figure 8. I n Q1 2013 France detected the most facilitators of irregular migration, but
detections in Bulgaria increased more than any other Member State
Detections of facilitators in Q1 2013 and percentage change from Q1 2012

4.4. Detections of facilitators
Notwithstanding an increase during the first
few months of 2011, detections of facilitators of irregular migration have been falling
steadily for the last two years. According to
some reports, this long-term decline may in
part be due to a widespread shift towards
the abuse of legal channels and document
fraud to mimic legal entry to the EU, which
results in facilitators being able to operate
remotely and inconspicuously rather than
accompanying migrants during high-risk activities such as border-crossing.

26 of 60

Consistent with this long-term decline, in
Q1 2013, there were 1 622 detections of facilitators of irregular migration, which is almost the lowest level since data collection
began in 2008 (Fig. 1). Nearly all the top five
reporting Member States detected fewer
facilitators of irregular migrants in Q1 2013
than in any time during the previous year.
As has been the case over recent reporting
periods, France, Italy and Spain detected the
most facilitators with two-thirds of all detections at the EU level.

The biggest increase in detections was in
Bulgaria, where detections almost doubled
from Q1 2012 to Q1 2013, although from a
rather low base. Most of these detections
were of Bulgarian nationals and were associated with illegal border-crossing from
Turkey, which increased in the second half
of 2012 as a weak displacement from the
Greek border.
Member States tend to detect more domestic facilitators than any other nationality; very
often most of the top reporting countries for
this indicator tend to report their own citizens as facilitators more frequently than any
other single nationality. In line with this tendency, the top three nationalities of facilitators detected in specific Member States were
Italians detected in Italy, French detected
in France, and Spanish detected in Spain. In
addition there were increased detections of
Algerian facilitators in France and Somalis
detected in Italy.

4.5. Detections of illegal stay
In Q1 2013, there were over 77 000 detections
of illegal stay in the EU, which is a reduction
of around 10% compared to both the previous quarter and the same quarter in 2012.
However, this figure was also the lowest ever
reported for this indicator*, and is consistent with the previously reported stable but
slightly declining long-term trend over the
last two years (Fig. 1). However, this longterm decline masks much variation among
Member States.
The vast majority of migrants staying illegally
were detected inland (64 071) and so are presumed to be long-term illegal stayers as, at
the time of detection, they were making no
attempt to leave. The next most common
location for detections of illegal stayers was
those exiting at the air (7 779) followed by the
land borders (4 117), whereby illegally staying

migrants were leaving the EU or Schengen
area and may have included those that were
over staying by short periods.
The phenomenon that decreased the most
compared to the previous quarter was detections on exit from France towards the UK.
However, the reduction was not of a specific
nationality, rather all the top nationalities
were reported in much lower numbers such
as Afghans, Albanians and Iranians.
Germany continued to report by far the most
detections of migrants illegally staying, followed by France and Spain. In Germany detections of illegal stayers also decline consistent
with the overall trend, but detections of Russian and Turkish nationals increased to their
highest ever levels to rank first and second
in Germany. A few Member States reported
increased detections compared to the previous quarter, thus going against the overall trend. However, these increases were
small and generally in line with previous reported figures. Detections even fell in Greece,
where there has been markedly increased
operational activity aimed at detecting illegal stayers in Athens and other urban areas.
The nationalities that were most commonly
detected as illegal stayers in the EU remained
generally unchanged compared to the previous quarter but in the longer term Syrians
have been detected in increasing numbers
since half way through 2012. However, even
detections of Syrians fell during the first three
months of 2013 compared with the end of
2012.

* Some of this decline
was due to changes in
reporting practices in the
Netherlands

Also increasing were numbers of unknown
nationalities which constituted more than
3 500 detections in Q1 2013 or more than 5%
of the total. If these detections tended to be
associated with one or a few nationalities
then they could seriously bias analyses of illegal stay at the EU level.

Refusals of entry in Q1 2013 and percentage change from Q1 2012

Of the exchanged data that were suitable
for analysis (Swedish data included asylum
seekers and all inland detections in Switzerland were of unknown nationalities), the most
significant phenomena relating to illegal stay
were Moroccans detected inland in Spain, Algerians detected in Belgium and Albanians and
Pakistanis detected in Greece. It is noteworthy that, despite reporting the most illegally
staying migrants, Germany does not appear
high up in the list of phenomena (linked to
single nationalities) – this is because in Q1
2013 (as in most previous reporting periods),
Germany detected over 150 different nationalities of illegally staying migrants at slightly

28 of 60

lower frequencies, whereas some other reporting countries tend to have single nationalities that are reported in very high numbers,
for example Moroccans in Spain.

4.6. Refusals of entry
In Q1 2013 there were nearly 28 000 refusals of entry at the external border, with
about 55% refused from the land border
and most of the remainder being refused
from the air border. In the context of recent years this figure is broadly in line with
other recent quarters, although it is slightly
lower than the second half of 2012 when

there were more than 30 000 refusals of
entry during each quarter.

After Ukrainians refused entry to Poland,
the second most common phenomenon
was Georgians refused entry to Poland at
the border with Belarus. Refusals of Georgian was increased compared to the same
period in 2012 but was at the lowest level
for the last 12 months.
Although from rather low bases, there were
three trends that increased notably during
Q1 2013. The first was Serbians refused entry at the Hungarian land border with Serbia, the second was Albanians refused entry
at the Greek land border with Albania, and
the third was Croatians refused at the Slovenian land border with Croatia.
Following recent increases in the number of
refusals of entry, in Q1 2013 Slovenia ranked
second among Member States (Fig. 9). The
most commonly refused nationality in Slovenia was Croatian for very wide variety of
reasons but mostly reasons A (No valid document) and I (Threat).

© EU

As has been the case for most other reporting periods, in Q1 2013 Poland refused
the most migrants (Fig. 9), mainly Ukrainian nationals refused entry at their land
border (up by 8% compared to the same period in 2012). Overall more than two-thirds
of all refused Ukrainian nationals were refused entry to Poland but the percentage
was even higher for Georgians, nearly 90%
of whom were refused entry to Poland.
EU Urges Greece To Up Asylum
The European Union has called on Greece to review
its asylum policies, especially for Syrians fleeing ‘atrocities’ in
their country. Greece grants asylum to as few as 1 in 100 000
applicants and the government has been acting to purge the
country of those in the country unlawfully.
European Commissioner for Home Affairs Cecilia Malmstroem
told a news conference after talks with Greek leaders that
the number of people gaining asylum in Greece ‘continues to
be very low, and I am particularly worried about this situation, especially about the Syrians.’ ‘Every day we hear atrocities about their country,’ she added.
Greece has complained it has received little support from
the EU to deal with waves of immigrants from Africa, the
Middle East, Asia and Eastern Europe and has been left to
fend almost by itself. Malmstroem, who came to Greece to
review the situation, said Syrian asylum seekers were ‘100
percent’ protected in other European countries, while protection was ‘close to zero percent’ in Greece.

4.7. Asylum claims
The number of claims of asylum in the EU increased steadily throughout 2012 from just
over 55 000 in Q1 to a staggering 83 446 applications in the final quarter of the year – the
highest every reported since data collection
began for this indicator in 2008 (FRAN data

do not include asylum applications submitted
inland in France or the Netherlands).
Much of this increase resulted from many
more applications submitted by Syrian and, to
a lesser extent, Serbian and Russian nationals

Applications for international protection

with particularly strong increases toward the
end of the year. As well as the nationalities
that submitted increasing numbers of applications, there was also a steady but very significant trend of claims submitted by Afghan
nationals – ranked second at the EU level.
During the first three months of 2013 there
was a reduction in the number of reported
asylum claims to just under 70 000 for the
quarter, but this remains a very significant
number of applications compared to previous reporting periods.

30 of 60

With an overwhelming 30% of all applications
submitted in the EU/Schengen area, Germany
received by far the most applications for international protection, and, with the exception
of the previous quarter, more asylum applications than reported by any Member State
in a single quarter since data collection began in early 2008. In Germany there was a
massive increase in the number of applications submitted by Russian nationals, to such
an extent that this phenomenon ranked top
in terms of nationalities submitting applications in a single Member State.

Without question, the most significant
trend in asylum applications throughout
2012 was increased applications submitted by Syrian nationals, which in Q4 2012
increased to nearly 9 000 applications and
11% of the EU total, amounting to more applications submitted by a single nationality
in any given quarter since data collection
began for this indicator. This continued into
the first three months of 2013. Indeed the
second and third most populous categories of nationalities submitting applications
in single Member States were Syrians submitting applications in Germany and Syrians submitting applications in Sweden. Two
thirds of all applications submitted by Syrians in Q1 2013 were in Germany or Sweden.
Given that Syrians are still highly detected
illegally crossing the border of the EU and
as document fraudsters, and that the civil
war shows no signs of abating, this flow of
asylum seekers is likely to continue.
Hungary reported a fivefold increase in
asylum applications over the last year. This
increase was due to more applications submitted by a range of nationalities such as
Kosovo* citizens, Pakistanis and Algerians.
Some reports suggest that there is a pull
factor in terms of a change of asylum legislation which prohibits the immediate return of asylum seekers to Serbia (see box).

4.8. Document fraud
In Q1 2013 there were nearly 2 000 detections
of document fraud on entry to the EU/Schengen area from third countries. The most commonly detected migrants using document
fraud on entry to the EU/Schengen area from
a third country were from Albania and Syria.
Also important were detections of document
fraud between the Schengen area and nonSchengen EU Member States. As is normally
the case, many of these were reported by the
UK, which is a common destination coun-

Sham wedding fixers ‘offer
groom’ for GBP 3 500
An undercover reporter posed as a
would-be bride from India who wants
to stay in Wales but with her work visa
due to run out. She was offered a Czech
husband by sham wedding fixers in Cardiff [UK] for GBP 3 500. She was also
advised how to convince the UK Border Agency she had been with her new
partner for more than a year.
The undercover team filmed a group of

try for irregular migrants travelling from the
Schengen area.
On intra-Schengen flights there were also
many detections of document fraud in Q1
2013, but the lowest level since reliable data
collection began at the beginning of 2012. The
decrease is widely recognised to be associated with the Greek operation Aspida at the
Greek land border with Turkey, which during
the reporting period, prevented many migrants from entering Greece and then boarding intra-Schengen flights in Athens.
Overall document fraud was most associated with migrants from:
1. Albania with 20% of all detections, and
2. Syria with 13% of all detections

32 of 60

4.8.1. Migrants from Albania
In Q1 2013 some 830 Albanians were detected using a total of 880 fraudulent documents, which is an increase of nearly a
third compared to the same period in 2012.
Without question Albanians represent the
biggest proportion of document fraud at
the EU level.
Albanians were mostly detected on entry to
the Schengen area from a third country but
also travelling between the Schengen area
and non-Schengen EU Member States. The
latter flow was almost exclusively between
the Schengen area and the UK, sometimes
via Ireland.
Greece detected more Albanians than any
other Member State, mostly on entry at
the Greek BCPs Kakavia and Kristalopigi
but at a reduced rate compared to Q1 2012.
In this context they were using counterfeit
Greek border-crossing stamps to fabricate
travel histories and extend periods of stay.
This phenomenon was the most apparent
form of document fraud in 2012, which may
be following a somewhat seasonal variation or may be in decline; data exchanged
in Q2 2013 should go some way to answering this question.
Albanians were also detected on exit from
Athens either on intra-Schengen flights or
on flights to the UK or Ireland.
4.8.2. Migrants from Syria
Syrians, on the other hand, were detected
on entry to the Schengen area on flights
from Turkey and on intra-Schengen flights
from Greece.
Throughout 2012 migrants from Syria were
increasingly detected as document fraudsters across Member States, such that there

was an overall sixfold increase since the beginning of the year (all travel types combined). During the first half of the year most
were detected on intra-Schengen flights
from Greece, presumably individuals who
had previously crossed the land border with
Turkey. In the final quarter of 2012 and during the first few months of 2013 the most
common embarkation point for Syrian document fraudsters was Istanbul.

decisions were unavailable from, inter alia,
France, the Netherlands and Sweden, where
it is assumed that high numbers of decisions
were reached.

4.9.1. Return decisions

Notwithstanding return decisions reached in
Greece, there was very little change in the
number of decisions made by other Member States. The UK for instance reported
little change in the number of return decisions reached, and while some other Member
States reported changes of between -20 and
+20%, these changes were within the range
of previous reporting periods.

In Q1 2013 there were 55 285 third-country
nationals subject to an obligation to leave
the EU as a result of an administrative or
judicial decision, which is a decrease of 21%
compared to during the same period in 2012.
The UK reached more decisions to leave than
any other member State, but there were
more Pakistanis that were subject to a decision to leave in Greece than any other single nationality in any Member State.

The exception was Bulgaria, where the
number of return decisions more than doubled in Q1 2013 as compared to Q1 2012. This
increase was due to more Syrians, Algerians, Palestinians and Malians being subject
to return decisions and almost certainly related to increased detections of illegal border-crossing since the beginning of Greek
operational activity at the Greek land border with Turkey (see Section 4.1.1.).

Most of the overall decrease was due to
50% fewer decisions being made in Greece,
where throughout 2012, more decisions
to leave were reached than in any other
Member State. Most of these decisions to
leave were handed to migrants after they
were detected illegally crossing the land
border between Greece and Turkey. During the first half of 2012 detections of illegal border-crossing in this region were
very significant at the EU level, but have
subsequently fallen to very low levels (see
Section 4.1.1.); correspondingly the number of return decisions reached in Greece
also fell down affecting figures for the EU
as a whole.

More Pakistanis were subject to decisions
to leave than any other nationality (4 723),
followed by Albanians (3 838), Moroccans
(3 439) and Indians (2 901). Pakistanis were
mostly issued decision to leave in Greece,
while Albanians were subject to decisions
to leave in similar numbers in both Greece
and Italy. All these nationalities were subject to similar numbers of decisions as a
year previously in Q1 2012.

4.9. Returns

Note that the absolute total number of migrants subject to return decisions is still underestimated by this indicator, as data on

At the Member State level there is often
a discrepancy between the number of return decisions reached and the number of
effective returns carried out. Some of the
differences may be due to time lags between judicial decisions and physical returns, while other differences may due to
the disappearance of migrants once a decision has been reached.

4.9.2. Effective returns
In Q1 2013, there continued to be little changes
in the total number of third-country nationals effectively returned to countries outside
the EU compared to most quarters in 2012.
The total number of 38 221 was however a 9%
decrease compared to the previous quarter
but was within the normal range of variation.
As has been the case during every quarter of
data exchange so far for this indicator, the UK
conducted the largest number of returns, in
this case up by 7% compared to the previous quarter, which is the most effective returns performed by any Member State during
any quarter since data collection began, and
nearly twice that of the Member State that
ranked second, which was Greece.
The most returned nationalities were Albanians (mostly returned by Greece), Pakistanis (returned by Greece and the UK)
and Indians (mostly returned by the UK).
Unfortunately, the number of migrants of
unspecified nationalities that were effectively returned increased massively from
just few hundred in Q1 2012 to nearly
2 000 in Q1 2013, which renders other
estimates of nationalities less effective.

reporting issues. Nearly all of these unspecified nationalities were reported by
France, where some 60% of all returned
migrants were reported as being of unknown nationalities.
Among the top 20 cases of return from the
EU/Schengen area classified as the nationality of the migrant and the returning Member State, ranked first and second at the EU
level with consistent numbers were Albanians returned by Greece and Indians returned
by the UK. Pakistanis were returned in significant numbers by both Greece and the UK.
The number of returns from Greece increased
significantly in October 2012, following the
launch of operation Xenios Zeus, which has
been underway since 2 August 2012 targeting illegal stayers mostly in Athens but also in
some other urban areas. Much of the increase
was due to more migrants from Pakistan and,
to a lesser extent, Bangladesh being forcibly
returned in much higher numbers during the
fourth quarter of 2012, almost certainly as a
result of the operation Xenios Zeus.
These widely-publicised activities will also
probably be contributing to the preventive
effect of operation Aspida at the Greek land

border with Turkey, as migrants will be aware
that even if they successfully cross the border they are still likely to be picked up by the
authorities inland. In fact, some open sources
claim that Greek police reports have come
to the same conclusion.

4.10. Other illegal activities at
the border
Criminal groups that operate across the EU
external borders pose a significant challenge
to European law-enforcement authorities.
They affect the overall management of the
external borders insofar as the prevention
of cross-border crime demands substantial personal and financial resources of European border agencies. The Frontex Risk
Analysis Unit works with Member States
to collect information with the purpose to
adapt operational activities to the dynamics of cross-border crime activities.
Risks, that shaped the crime picture along
the borders in the first quarter of 2013, were
influenced by seasonal fluctuations, vulnerabilities along the borders, and changing operational schemes of transnational organised
crime groups. In Q1 2013, particularly significant in terms of impact on the security of
borders and EU citizens were the following trends:
n	At the eastern borders, the continuation of
frequent organised, large-scale and individual tobacco smuggling cases from particularly Ukraine and Belarus, and a slight
decrease in the detection of stolen vehicles smuggled in the opposite direction.
n	Along the Balkans route, an increase in
the smuggling of cannabis from Albania,
influenced by vulnerable borders in the
Western Balkans.
n	At the Western Mediterranean and Western African routes, well-organised and

large-scale cases of cocaine smuggling
were concealed among a large volume of
legitimate international commercial trade
and increasingly sophisticated methods to
hide the substance.
Due to the winter season and the absence
of Frontex Joint Operations in the Mediterranean Sea in the first quarter of 2013, the
emphasis of this chapter is placed on the eastern borders of the EU and the Balkans route.
4.10.1. Eastern borders
Smuggling of tobacco products
The excise good most smuggled across the
eastern external borders into the EU are
tobacco products. Most prominent among
them are cigarettes, but also hand rolling tobacco is found by the authorities. The characteristics of this illegal trade have changed
over the last decade. The illicit import of
counterfeit tobacco products and cigarettes
of less common brands have replaced the
large-scale smuggling of well-known products. This trend is partly caused by Cooperation Agreements that were signed between
the European Commission and the world’s
largest tobacco manufacturers through
which the companies oblige themselves to
sell their products only to registered customers and prevent their products from falling
into the hands of criminals. This cooperation gave a larger share of the black market to ‘cheap whites’ exclusively produced
for the purpose of smuggling and other cigarettes of inferior quality. A major part of
these products are smuggled across the EU
eastern borders.
Independent from the different short-term
trends at individual border sections that
are often influenced seasonally, all Member
States across the eastern border rank the
smuggling of tobacco high among the risks

borders. The Member States located along
the eastern border to the Russian Federation,
Belarus, and Ukraine experienced different
trends regarding this crime during the first
two months of the year. Slovakia and Latvia
reported a clear decrease in the smuggling
of excise goods.

Lithuania, which neighbours both the Russian
and Belarusian territory reported a growing
share of cigarettes smuggled from Belarus,
while the illicit imports from the Russian Federation substantially decreased during the last
years. This seems to be confirmed by Frontex
JO Focal Points Land, which reported only five
incidents of cigarette smuggling from the Russian Federation between January and March
2013. The Lithuanian State Border Guard Service continued to identify illicit activities on its
railway connections with Belarus. The Minsk
to Vilnius train connection received particular
attention. Smuggled cigarettes with Belarusian excise labels are detected on a regular basis, as, for example, on 14 January 2013,
when Lithuanian authorities found more than
30 000 cigarettes of the Belarusian brands
‘Minsk’, ‘Fest’ and ‘Alliance’ that were placed
in bags under passenger seats. Only few days
before, Lithuanian border guards discovered
a similar amount of smuggled tobacco products in corners and cavities of a freight train
engine coming from Belarus.
Romanian reports show that cigarette smuggling activities across the Ukrainian and Moldovan border between January and February
2013 remained rather stable compared to the
previous winter season. On the other hand,
Estonia registered a strong increase in smuggled cigarettes in relation to the previous reporting period.
On 25 February, the Polish Border Guard succeeded in the disruption of a large smuggling
operation with the seizure of a lorry in proximity of the Slovakian border. The trailer contained 4.5 million cigarettes of the Mayfair

36 of 60

brand, which presumably were on their way
from an unknown Western Balkan country
to the UK. The Polish driver and another passenger of the lorry with Polish number plates
were arrested.
The Polish authorities moreover discovered numerous smuggling cases on passenger and freight trains from Belarus and
Ukraine. The incidents ranged from individuals transporting smaller amounts of up to
5 000 pieces to large-scale and organised
undertakings. In February, a joint action between border guards, customs officers and
railway security that involved the use of a
dog specialised on tobacco products revealed the smuggling of near to 300 000
cigarettes that were hidden under floors,
seats and above ceilings of a train from
Ukraine. Three individuals from Ukraine,
one of them an employee from the Ukrainian railway company pleaded guilty to have
committed the offense. In two other cases
that were uncovered in January, together
480 000 cigarettes were discovered under
train wagons transporting logs.
The intensity of smuggling activities
strongly depends on their acceptance by the
general public. The Lithuanian Free Market Institute recently published a study*,
which shows that 62% of Lithuanians, 51%
of Latvians and 31% of Estonians, justify or
rather justify the smuggling and consumption of smuggled excise goods such as cigarettes, alcohol products and fuel. A large
share of the population in the Baltic countries thinks that the illicit import of these
goods has increased in 2012. A majority of
these countries’ citizens moreover believes
that a combination of increasing product
prices, decreasing incomes, and weakening opportunities to afford legal goods are
the main causes for smuggling. The survey
represents only three countries, but certainly mirrors a widely established opinion in larger parts of the EU population.

Frequent detections of cigarette smuggling
along the eastern external borders of the
EU should not obscure the fact that numerous illicitly imported tobacco products are
destined for Western European countries.
The attractiveness of this criminal business is naturally proportional to the price
difference between source and destination
country of the smuggled goods. As no regular customs controls exist within the EU
on the route westwards to Member States
with high tobacco taxes, the risk of shipping
cigarettes there increases at a lower pace
once the EU external borders are crossed.
According to open sources, alone in February and March, 21 million illicit cigarettes
were discovered in the Netherlands. A continuation of this rate of detections would
mean a substantial increase for 2014, after
62 and 210 million were seized, respectively,
in 2012 and 2011.

that the smuggling of fuel has increased during the last year. 29% admitted that they
or one of their family members has bought
smuggled fuel. The study points out that
at the end of August 2012, one litre of Diesel costs EUR 1.36 in Lithuania, whereas a
customer has to pay only half the price in
the Russian Federation. The amount of fuel
smuggled across the EU border is hard to assess, because in most cases the amounts are
limited and difficult to detect. Private cars
with a regular fuel tank capacity of up to
100 litres are frequently used to import fuel
that is then resold with large profit within
the EU.

Apart from coming on land from Eastern
Europe, many of the illegally smuggled cigarettes are also shipped on vessels from the
Russian Federation and Ukraine via Dutch
harbours, where they are repacked for transport to the UK and Ireland.
Smuggling of fuel
According to the abovementioned study on
the population attitude towards smuggling,
60% of the Lithuanian population believes

Regarding commercial road freight, Poland
has introduced a restriction that allows drivers to enter the EU at its BCPs with a maximum of 600 litres only. However, as this limit
does not exist in Lithuania, it would be easy
for drivers of commercial vehicles with extended tanks to simply enter the EU through
Lithuania instead. The example shows the
difficulty to curb the deliberate and systematic illicit import of fuel without international
coordination. In mid-March, the Lithuanian
authorities discovered one case of this profitable trade in the town of Silutes. A Lithuanian and a Russian citizen used the internal
tank of a lorry to repeatedly transfer cheap
fuel from the Russian Federation to Lithuania, where it was pumped into separate containers and sold.

Exit of stolen vehicles at the eastern
borders
Both reports of international and national
bodies show a clear reduction in the numbers of stolen motor vehicles in Europe within
the last ten years. The UN Office on Drugs
and Crime claims that the rate of stolen land
vehicles, including cars, motorcycles, buses,
lorries, construction and agricultural vehicles, decreased by 44% between 2003 and
2010. Europol and national figures of Member States confirm this general downward
tendency. On a European level, the existing
figures indicate to a certain degree a correlation between the gross domestic product
of a country and its level of vehicle thefts.
However, also in those countries with a high
GDP, thefts decreased substantially. Norway
in 2012 registered a 75% decrease of stolen
vehicles within the last ten years. While Germany counted 63 240 vehicle misappropriations in 2003, the number was reduced to
41 057 in 2011. The regional distribution of
the thefts in Germany shows a concentration of vehicle theft towards the country’s
east, which is in accordance with the main
direction of the later movement of the stolen vehicles, which primarily points towards
Eastern Europe. Poland and Lithuania play
a particular role as transit countries. After
crossing the EU external borders there, only
a certain part of these vehicles are being sold
in Ukraine and Belarus, while Central Asian
States show to be key markets for the remaining share.
Frontex Joint Operations at the EU external
borders to Eastern Europe in the first quarter 2013 reported 41 stolen vehicle detections,
which is on the level of the same period of
2012. Compared to the last quarter of 2012
however, the number was reduced by 50%.
As in 2012, the detection rates were highest
at the Polish BCPs of Medyka to Ukraine and
Terespol to Belarus, where, respectively, 15

Figure 15. P
 olish BCPs at the border with Ukraine and Belarus registered the highest number of stolen vehicles on exit
from the EU in Q1 2013

and 16 stolen cars were stopped from leaving the EU.
With 22% in Q1 2013, vans and transporters had a remarkably high share among the
stolen vehicles detected through Joint Operations at the eastern external borders. In
Norway, this category occupied the top three
places in the list of the most stolen models
in 2012. The fact that transporters in many
cases possess less sophisticated protective
mechanisms partly explains this trend. Another reason is that the market demand in

the destination countries is relatively high
for these vehicles. Furthermore, a number
of stolen vans were also detected with other
stolen goods inside, thereby increasing their
criminal value.
Numbers from Frontex Joint Operations suggest that BMW, Mercedes, and Volkswagen
were the most detected stolen vehicle brands
on exit from the EU. Among all brands, SUVs
were particularly popular among car thieves,
or they may just be subject to increased scrutiny by border guards.

Analyses of this crime suggest a high degree
of specialisation and technical expertise with
the criminal groups active in this field. As
costly technical devices (such as radio jammers) are used to break electronic locks and
disable tracking devices many luxury cars are
equipped with, this criminal activity requires
substantial financial investments. The different steps from the actual theft to the transport and sale in the destination countries are
divided between different groups, and their
individual members are rarely informed on
the entire process.

China, destined for Belarus, which showed
to emit a radiation of around 0.3 microsievert (mSv), thereby exceeding the legal limit
of 0.2 mSv. The national authority responsible for radiation safety allowed the three
shipments to pass through EU territory after an inspection, as they did not show to
pose a threat to public health. In Lithuania
alone, 74 cases of increased radiation at the
country’s borders triggered an alarm in 2012
and represented a good example of interagency cooperation.
4.10.2. Western Balkans

Hazardous goods
Smuggling of drugs
Many Member State authorities possess Radiation Portal Monitors (RPM) at the external EU land borders and container ports (see
Fig. 16). They are designed to detect traces
of radiation emanating from a vehicle passing through the device. At smaller BCPs, authorities are also using mobile appliances for
this purpose. The monitors are built to identify gamma radiation, and sometimes include
neutron detectors for the interception of nuclear threats. At European and Asian borders,
RPMs were increasingly deployed in the 1990s
to prevent the proliferation of nuclear materials from the territory of the former Soviet
Republics. The USA installed many of these
devices particularly at container ports after
the September 2001 terrorist attacks to detect the smuggling of Radiological Dispersal Devices, broadly known as ‘dirty bombs’.
In most cases, however, alarm procedures
are triggered by commercial goods emitting
radiation, including fertilisers and building
materials such as ceramic, tiles, porcelain,
granite and other clay- or rock-based products, which naturally contain radioactive
sources. On 18 January 2013, the Lithuanian authorities detected a sudden rise in
the number of alerts at the Klaipeda Container Terminal. They were triggered by
a larger delivery of porcelain bricks from

The Western Balkans route, which connects
the heroin trade from mainly Afghanistan to
Europe, is subject to strong scrutiny of lawenforcement and border-control authorities.
The extent of opium cultivation in Afghanistan and treatment statistics in the EU stand
in contrast to the seizures conducted in the
Western Balkan countries, through which a
large share of the heroin trade flows. The UN
Office on Drugs and Crime estimates that
60 tonnes of heroin are smuggled annually
from Afghanistan along the Balkan route,
and that at least 10 tonnes of the substance
flows through Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, according to the country’s seizure statistics, only 10 kg of heroin were seized by
the country’s law-enforcement authorities
in 2012. Although the total seizures in the region by far do not reflect the dimension of
this illicit trade, some countries could demonstrate effective disruptions of that business in the first quarter of 2013.
On 24 January 2013, a joint activity of the Serbian police and customs administration led to
the seizure of 21 kg of heroin in a spare wheel
of the jeep of a Turkish citizen coming from
the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
and passing through the Presevo BCP. The
driver used to work and live in Germany. The

 adiation Portal Monitor at the Lithuanian border

illicit substance was detected through a mobile scanner, which showed that the wheel
was filled with a large number of small parcels. The shipment had an estimated value
of around EUR 500 000.
In the beginning of February, law-enforcement authorities at the border-crossing
point of the Bulgarian Svilengrad railway
station detected 30 000 bottles of fake
perfumes (Boss, Chanel, D&G, Givenchy,
and Armani) behind pellets of glass jars in
a train. The freight was officially destined
for the Netherlands, with the likely purpose to satisfy heightened customer demand ahead of the St. Valentine’s Day. The
particularity about this case was that 8 kg
of heroin were filled into some of the flacons, worth more than EUR 500 000. The
final destination for the shipment was a
city in Germany.

During the last years, the significance of the
Balkan and Black Sea region for the import of
cocaine to the EU has been growing steadily. According to a study published by the
European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and
Drug Addiction and Europol*, the cocaine
seizures in Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, and
Turkey represent only a small proportion of
2% of the total number of seizures in Europe,
but their share has tripled since 2001. Based
on the result of their risk analysis, Bulgarian
customs officers on 7 January 2013 searched
a freight container from St. Lucia. Hidden in
two jet skis, they found 12 packages containing more than 3 kg of cocaine worth around
EUR 1.8 million. The freight was addressed to
a resident of Plovdiv.

have achieved a more important position in
that criminal activity. On 22 March 2013, for
example, Spanish authorities arrested a Bulgarian and a Serbian national, both 30 years
old, when entering the Spanish marina of Sotogrande in a private vessel with 590 kg of
cocaine onboard.
A 175% increase in marijuana seizures in Albania between 2011 and 2012 both represents a
result of intensified law-enforcement activity, but also of expanded marijuana production. In Q1 2013, large amounts of the drug,
mostly produced in Albania, were seized on
their way to EU countries. On 7 January, the
authorities in the former Yugoslav Republic
of Macedonia stopped and searched a lorry
transporting mattresses at the Medzitlija border-crossing point to Greece. The inspection
of the trailer led to the detection of 342 kg
of marijuana, concealed in the inner part of
the mattresses. The substance was bought
from Albania and was destined for resale in
the Netherlands.
On 3 March 2013, the Hellenic Coast guard
detected in the port of Patras 327 packages
of cannabis in a cavity under the cargo of a
lorry driven by a Slovak citizen. The destination of the lorry was Italy. Also on his way to
Italy two weeks later, a Greek national was
stopped by border guards before attempting
to embark the ferry to Italy in Igoumenitsa

with more than 391 kg of cannabis behind the
cargo of his lorry.
Other shipments from the region were detected on a route through the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Serbia. On
10 January, Serbian officers found 908 kg
of Marijuana in a lorry attempting to leave
Serbia to Croatia through the BCP of Batrovci. The drugs were meant to be sold in
Switzerland.
Officers deployed through Frontex JO Focal
Points Land contributed to the disruption of
the cannabis trade by detecting five cases of
cannabis smuggling, seizing 38 kg of the substance at the BCP of Roszke between Serbia and Hungary.
Weapons
According to an article published in Sarajevo’s daily newspaper Dnevni Avaz in
March 2013, a high official from the NATO
HQ in Sarajevo warned about 13 000 to
18 000 tonnes of surplus arms and ammunition in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which
are not centrally registered. According to
the official, the risk of abuse is high and the
country should be considered to be a place
from which weapons and explosives are being smuggled. In March 2013, a wire-guided

On 9 March 2013, the Hellenic Coast Guard
arrested two Bulgarian and one Italian national at the port of Igoumenitsa for attempting to smuggle weapons and drugs to
Italy. Four assault rifles, five magazines, five
silencers, 46 cartridges and 1.4 kg of cannabis were found in the van belonging to the
suspects. According to Greek media sources,
in a prior case in January 2013, the Greek authorities detected large amounts of weapons and ammunition loaded on the vessel
‘Alexandretta’ coming from Turkey. The ship,
which was registered as a cement bulk cargo
ship, was forced by the police to dock at the
port of Volos for further investigations. The
destination of the illicit freight could not be
established.
4.10.3. Central Mediterranean route
Although the Central Mediterranean route
is rather associated with irregular migration, Malta recently registered more attempts to smuggle diesel from North Africa.
On 28 March 2013, the Libyan coastguard
stopped an Egyptian boat smuggling contraband diesel to Malta. The 13 persons onboard included also one Maltese national.
According to documents discovered onboard, the vessel made already three trips
to Malta during the same month. According
to Maltese media sources, the smuggling of

anti-tank missile of the ‘Fagot’ model went
missing from the Bosnian army barracks
‘Kula 2’ in Mrkonjićgrad and was not found
since then. Moreover, gaps apparently exist
in the procedure related to the storage of
cleared mines, which is under the responsibility of the Federation’s Civil Protection
Administration. According to experts, the
inventory of stored mines includes data on
their numbers, but does not register their
weight, which would enable the undetected
removal of explosives from the thousands
of the still existing devices.

the beginning of the Arab Spring. Most of
the smuggled fuel is sold in open waters
to Maltese fishermen or to criminals, who
further transport it to the Maltese coast.
4.10.4. Western Mediterranean and
West African routes
Routes from the African continent to Europe, especially to the Iberian Peninsula,
were again in Q1 2013 heavily used by criminal organisations for the trafficking of cocaine and marijuana. Seizures affected both
regular smuggling attempts by individual
travellers boarding ferries and planes to
the EU and large-scale and highly organised shipments of mainly cocaine originating
from Latin America. Although the overall amounts seized in Spain and Portugal
clearly decreased after peaking at 80 tonnes
in 2006, falling retail prices in the region on
the other hand may point to an increasing
availability.
According to the EU Drug Markets Report
published by the EMCDDA and Europol in
January 2013, the cocaine market has been
subject to increased liberalisation, with Colombian groups becoming less important and

more fragmented. Bolivia and Peru have increased their role as production countries.
West Africa plays an increasing role as a waypoint for the supply of drugs from Latin America. Law-enforcement authorities should give
particular attention to the growing involvement of Mexican cartels and their role in the
supply chain between producer and destination countries*.
On 1 February 2013, a criminal group imported six containers of leather from Columbia through the port of Algeciras to Spain
and delivered it to a factory in the city of
Elche. Spanish law-enforcement agencies,
triggered by a previously detected indicator, searched the cargo during the Operation Pluto, and indeed discovered the largest
amount of cocaine since 2001: 3 732 packs
of the drug contained each around 1.1 kg,
amounting to a total of 4.1 tonnes. The police arrested 16 suspects and as a result of
searches conducted at their residences and
properties, weapons, computers, and luxury vehicles were seized.
In another operation conducted on 15
March, British, Portuguese, and Spanish
authorities raided a ship in the Atlantic
Ocean being on the way to Portugal. Involved officers seized the two tons of cocaine located onboard and arrested the
crew consisting of four Brazilians and one
Korean. The alleged organisers, including
the Venezuelan head of the group were arrested in Porto, Portugal, on the next day.
Within the reference period, at least four
more seizures of between 240 and 670 kg
of cocaine smuggled into the EU were conducted by the Spanish police at the ports
of Algeciras, Barcelona and Sotogrande.
The incidents reported in Q1 2013 indicate
at least a temporary accumulation of large
scale seizures and at the same time confirm the assumption of a fragmentation of
the cocaine trade in terms of nationalities
and countries involved.

44 of 60

Spain and Portugal are the most significant
entry gates of cannabis resin to Europe. According to the EMCDDA and Europol, Spain
accounted for 70% of all seizures in Europe
in 2011, but reached its lowest level since
1997. On average, Spain intercepts 2 kg of
the substance per seizure, but amounts exceeding a ton are detected on a regular basis, such as on 1 March 2013, when Spanish
police seized 2.65 tonnes of hashish arriving
in the port of Algeciras. The illicit substance
brought into the Iberian Peninsula is produced in Morocco and further transported
into France, from where it is sold locally or
transported to other EU countries to the
east and north. The Netherlands and Belgium are used as distribution and storage
centres. Italy plays a minor role as a European entry point for the cannabis resin.
4.10.5. Trafficking in human beings
Q1 2013 shows a number of substantial disruptions of criminal groups involved in trafficking of human beings. Spanish authorities
in February 2013 dismantled an organisation that ran six brothels in the region of
Andalucía. The perpetrators, who continuously convinced victims from Latin America under false pretence to come to Spain,
used a large network of licit companies in
order to launder their proceeds of crime.
Payment terminals for the brothels’ clients
were connected to these companies in order to disguise the origin of the profits. 52
suspects were arrested and besides the offense of human trafficking, they were accused of money laundering, bribery, and
labour exploitation.
At the same time, the French police has dismantled an organisation trafficking Nigerian women for sexual exploitation. Seven
persons, who operated the illicit business
across France, have been arrested. The proceeds of the exploitation scheme amounted
to around EUR 90 000 per month.

Sources and Methods
For the data concerning detections at the external borders, some of the border types are
not applicable to all FRAN Member States.
This pertains to data on all FRAN indicators
since the data are provided disaggregated
by border type. The definitions of detections
at land borders are therefore not applicable (excluding borders with non-Schengen
principalities) for Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Iceland,
Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland and
the UK. For Cyprus, the land border refers to
the Green Line demarcation with the area
not under the effective control of the government of the Republic of Cyprus. For sea
borders, the definitions are not applicable for
land-locked Member States including Austria,
the Czech Republic, Hungary, Luxembourg,
Slovakia and Switzerland.
In addition, data on detections of illegal border-crossing at land, air and sea BCPs (1B) are
not available for Iceland, Ireland and Spain
and in Greece, these detections are included
in the data for Indicator 1A. Data for Norway only includes detections of illegal border-crossing at land and sea BCPs (1B), not
between BCPs (1A).
In Italy, detections of illegal border-crossing
at sea BCPs are only reported for intra-EU
border-crossing from Greece. Data on detections of illegal border-crossing between
sea BCPs (1A) are not available for Ireland.

Data on apprehension (FRAN Indicator 2) of
facilitators is not available for Ireland. For Italy, the data are not disaggregated by border
type, but are reported as total apprehensions (not specified). Data for Italy and Norway also include the facilitation of illegal stay
and work. For Romania, the data include
land intra-EU detections on exit at the border with Hungary.
For the data concerning detections of illegal
stay (FRAN Indicator 3), data on detections
at exit are not available for Denmark, Ireland,
Italy, Spain and the UK.
Data on refusals of entry (FRAN Indicator 4)
at the external EU borders are not disaggregated by reason of refusal for Ireland and
the UK. Refusals of entry at the Spanish land
borders at Ceuta and Melilla (without the issuance of a refusal form) are reported separately and are not included in the presented
FRAN data.
The data on applications for international
protection (FRAN Indicator 5) are not disaggregated by place of application (type of
border on entry or inland applications) for
Austria, the Czech Republic and Slovenia. For
these countries, only the total number of applications is reported. For France, only asylum applications at the external borders are
reported, not inland applications. For Switzerland, requests for asylum at the Swiss
Embassies abroad are also reported and considered as inland applications in the FRAN
data. For the UK, data reported for applications at air BCPs also include applications
at sea BCPs
