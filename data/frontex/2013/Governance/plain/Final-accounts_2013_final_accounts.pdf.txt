1.1. Introduction
The annual accounts are drawn up in accordance with the Financial Regulation of European Agency for
the Management of the Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the
European Union (hereinafter Frontex). The annual accounts of Frontex include the financial statements
and the report on implementation of the budget.
The objectives of financial statements are to provide information about the financial position,
performance and cash flows of Frontex.
The financial statements have been prepared according to the accounting rules adopted by the European
Commission’s accountant, following the principles of accrual based accountancy where the economic
outturn, balance and cash flow are concerned. It should be noted that under Frontex Financial
Regulation, the accounts consist of the general accounts and the budget accounts, both kept in euro.
The general accounts are accrual accounts which mean that the effects of transactions and other events
are recognised when those transactions or events occur (and not only when cash or its equivalent is
received or paid). They are based on the IPSAS (International Public Sector Accounting Standards). The
general accounts allow for the preparation of the financial statements as they show all revenues and
expenses for the financial year and are designed to establish the financial position in the form of a
balance sheet at 31 December.
The budget execution is prepared on the basis of a modified cash accounting. In cash accounting system,
payments made and revenue received are recorded. Modified cash accounts means that payment
appropriations carried over are also recorded. They are used to produce the budgetary outturn account
and reports on budget implementation.
These provisions lead to discrepancies between the general accounts and the budget accounts.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the period.
According to Article 82 of Frontex Financial Regulation, Agency’s Accounting Officer shall send to the
Commission's Accounting Officer and the Court of Auditors by no later than 1 st of March of the following
year its provisional accounts, together with the report on budgetary and financial management during
the year.
The Director shall send the final accounts, together with the opinion of the Management Board, to the
Commission’s Accounting Officer, the Court of Auditors, the European Parliament and the Council, by 1st
of July of the following year at the latest.
Finally the final accounts are presented to the Council and Parliament for discharge.

Final Accounts 2013, 03 June 2014

1.2. Accounting principles
The financial statements of Frontex are drawn up in accordance with the generally accepted accounting
principles:
a) Going concern basis principle
The going-concern principle means that for the purposes of preparing the financial statements, Frontex is
deemed to be established for an indefinite duration.
b) Principle of prudence
The principle of prudence means that assets and income have not been overstated and liabilities and
charges have not been understated. No hidden reserves or undue provisions have been created.
c) Principle of consistent accounting methods
The principle of consistent accounting methods means that the structure of the components of the
financial statements and the accounting methods and valuation rules has not been changed from one
year to the next.
d) Principle of comparability of information
The principle of comparability of information means that for each item the financial statements also
show the amount of the corresponding item the previous year.
Where, pursuant to previous paragraph, the presentation or the classification of one of the components
of the financial statements is changed, the corresponding amounts for the previous year have been made
comparable and reclassified. Where it has been impossible to reclassify items, this shall be explained in
the annex.
e) Materiality principle
The materiality principle means that all operations which are of significance for the information sought
have been taken into account in the financial statements. Materiality has been assessed in particular by
reference to the nature of the transaction or the amount.
Transactions may be aggregated where:
(a) The transactions are identical in nature, even if the amounts are large;
(b) The amounts are negligible;
(c) Aggregation makes for clarity in the financial statements.
f) No-netting principle
The no-netting principle means that receivables and debts may not be off-set against each other, nor
may charges and income, save where charges and income derive from the same transaction, from similar
transactions or from hedging operations and provided that they are not individually material.
g) Principle of reality over appearance
The principle of reality over appearance means that accounting events recorded in the financial
statements have been presented by reference to their economic nature.
h) Accrual-based accounting principle
The accrual-based accounting principle means that transactions and events have been entered in the
accounts when they occurred and not when amounts were actually paid or recovered. They shall be
booked to the financial years to which they relate.

Final Accounts 2013, 03 June 2014

Currency
Frontex 2013 financial statements are presented in euro, the euro being the European Union's functional
and reporting currency.
Economic transactions in other currencies than in euro have been converted into euro on the basis of
European Commission’s official rate “Infor-Euro”.
Due to the Agency’s location outside of Euro-zone, a substantial number of transactions during reporting
period occurred in Polish Zlotys. Foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses resulting from
transactions in other currencies than euro have been reflected in economic outturn account.
Year-end balances of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are converted
into euro on the basis of the exchange rates applying on 31 December 2013.
Use of estimates
In accordance with IPSAS and generally accepted accounting principles, the financial statements
necessarily include amounts based on estimates and assumptions by management based on the most
reliable information available. Significant estimates include, but are not limited to, provisions, financial
risk on inventories and accounts receivables, accrued income and charges, contingent assets and
liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in the
period in which they become known.

3. ANNEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
3.1. Notes to the Balance Sheet
3.1.1. Non current assets
Assets are resources controlled by Frontex as a result of past events and from which future economic
benefits or service potential are expected to flow to the entity.
Fixed assets are assets with an acquisition price value above 420.00 euro and are expected to be used
during more than one year. Assets, which do not fall under the above described criteria, have been
charged against expenses and are reflected in the economic outturn account. Repairs and maintenance
are recognised as running expenses during the financial period in which they are incurred.
The assets were valued in the financial statements at their purchase price minus depreciations, in
order to give a fair view of Frontex assets.
Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life. The
depreciation method chosen is the straight-line method. Frontex fixed assets are depreciated on a
monthly basis. The depreciation rates are the coefficients used at the European Commission. The
applied depreciation annual percentage rates per asset types are as follows:

Intangible fixed assets:
Computer software

25.0%

Tangible fixed assets:
Specific equipment
Transport equipment
Computers, servers, printers etc.
Telecommunications and audiovisual equipment
Security, safety and protective equipment
Equipment for kitchen

Intangible assets are identifiable non-monetary assets without physical substance.
Frontex intangible fixed assets consist mainly of computer software and intangible assets under
construction. At 31.12.2013, the Agency had various projects of different scope and nature ongoing,
the costs of which were capitalised in case they reached the internal threshold for capitalisation.

3.1.2. Current assets
3.1.2.1. Short-term pre-financing
Pre-financing is a payment intended to provide the beneficiary with a float, i.e. cash advance. It may
be split into a number of payments over a period defined in the particular pre-financing agreement.
The float or advance shall be used for the purpose for which it was provided during the period defined
in the agreement. If the beneficiary does not incur eligible expenditures, he has the obligation to
return the pre-financing advance to Frontex. The amount of the pre-financing is reduced (wholly or
partially) by the acceptance of eligible costs and amounts returned, and this amount is recognised as
an expense.
The short-term pre-financing balance amounts to 1,471,869.17 euro

allowances, insurance, social contributions etc.) covered by the Conditions of Employment of Other
Servants of the European Communities.

Final Accounts 2013, 03 June 2014

Operational expenses equalling to 49,714,597.62 euro relate to Frontex operational activities (budget
title 3: Operational activities).
3.2.3. Financial expenses
Financial expenses totalling to 10,402.49 euro relate to paid bank fees 10,381.98 euro and 20.51 euro
to late payment interests to vendors.

3.2.4. Economic result for the year
The economic result for the year is a surplus of 7,765,780.77 euro. In the previous year, the economic
result was a deficit of 6,072,245.79 euro. This gives a total variation for both years of 13,838,026.56
euro.
The main reason for this variation may be mainly explained by the decrease in the amount of operating
expenses by 6,397,460.53 euro - whereas administrative expenses decreased slightly by 301,126.72
euro – and by the increase of total revenue by 7,436,331.25 euro in 2013.

By the end of 2013, the Agency hold funds in cash and cash equivalents on bank accounts in the amount
of 26,338,294.21 euro. At the beginning of the reporting period the cash amounted to 13.457,781.61
euro which gives an increase of cash and cash equivalents of 12,880,512.60 euro.
The Agency hold more cash as less short term receivables were outstanding in comparison to the
previous year (variation of -2,253,136.38 euro). The amount of Accounts Payable increased (variation
of 1,639,378.35 euro). Thus the cash status at the end of the reporting period can be considered as
stable and the Agency as liquid.

 It is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits or service
potential will be required to settle the obligation; or
 The amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.
Operating lease
Short-term operating lease expenses with regards to office premises rent to be paid during the year
2013 equal to 3,094,592.39 euro.

The Management Board adopted on 4 November 2013 a budget amendment (Budget 2013 N1) for an
additional € 8.2M thus the final budget for 2013 amounted to € 93.9M.The basis for this amendment
was the European Council which on 24 -25 October called for the reinforcement of Frontex activities
in the Mediterranean and along the South Eastern borders of the EU. In addition, the JHA Council on
22 October also called for specific reinforcements in Frontex operational activities.
Twenty nine budget transfers were processed in 2013; twenty seven of which were transfers within
titles and two between titles within the limit of 10% according to Article 27 of the Frontex Financial
Regulation. All transfers could therefore be made on the authority of the Executive Director without
prior approval of the Management Board.

The 2013 budget appropriations of € 93.9M are higher when compared with 2012 of € 89.6M. This difference is
due to the increase in Frontex 2013 budget by € 8.2M for the reinforcement of Frontex activities in the
Mediterranean and along the South Eastern borders of the EU. For 2013 98% of the appropriations have been
committed which is similar to 2012 (99%). The payment implementation level of 64% is lower compared with
2012 (75%).

In line with Article 10 of the Financial Regulation, a proposal for a decision on the non-automatic carry over
for the amount of € 0.5 was adopted by the Management Board in February 2013.
The non use of appropriations was due to the fact that in one case, a contract signed to purchase aerial
border surveillance services could not be implemented due to the lack of necessary import licences to
perform the contract; in the other case legal obstacles rendered the signature of a service level agreement
impossible between the EU Satellite Center and Frontex.

Internal assigned revenue concerns funds recovered from third parties. These funds are stemming initially
from the regular budget (C1) voted by the budgetary authority. Their reuse is not conditioned by specific
contracts or agreements with third parties. The sums can be used in the same way as the voted
appropriations without further restrictions. Recovery orders amounting to € 112 399 were issued in 2013.
The amount € 18 342 that was not committed as of 31.12.2013 is available for commitments in 2014, i.e.
carried over to Fund Source C5. The amount of € 17 694 is available in 2014 only for payments, i.e. carried
over to Fund Source C8.
