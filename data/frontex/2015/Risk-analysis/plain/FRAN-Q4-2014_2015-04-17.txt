Frontex official publications fall into four main categories: risk analysis, training, operations
and research, each marked with a distinct graphic identifier. Risk analysis publications
bear a triangular symbol formed by an arrow drawing a triangle, with a dot at the centre.
Metaphorically, the arrow represents the cyclical nature of risk analysis processes and its
orientation towards an appropriate operational response. The triangle is a symbol of ideal
proportions and knowledge, reflecting the pursuit of factual exactness, truth and exhaustive
analysis. The dot at the centre represents the intelligence factor and the focal point where
information from diverse sources converges to be processed, systematised and shared as
analytical products. Thus, Frontex risk analysis is meant to be at the centre and to form
a reliable basis for its operational activities.

Executive summary
In the fourth quarter of 2014 indicators of irregular migration and asylum exchanged under the Frontex Risk Analysis Network (FRAN)
changed only slightly compared the third quarter of 2014. Winter months tend to be marked
by substantially lower migration pressure at the
external borders, but in Q4 2014 detections of
illegal border-crossings and illegal stay dropped
less significantly and did not fall to the levels of
previous winter seasons. In effect, these two
indicators proved the highest out of all fourth
quarters since FRAN data collection began in
2007. Compared to the same period in 2013,
detections at the external borders increased
by more than 160%.
While the migratory pressure at the EU’s
external borders in general has not relaxed
much, its distribution among particular border
sections has been shifting. For instance, far
more detections were reported at the Western Balkan route. By contrast, on the Central
Mediterranean route, the number of irregular
migrants detected in Q4 proved lower than
the peak of Q3 2014, as the rough weather
conditions at sea led to fewer migrant boats
attempting the dangerous crossing.
In line with seasonal reductions in the Central Mediterranean, a lower number of irregular migrants from African countries arrived
in the EU in the fourth quarter. Especially Eritreans and sub-Saharans were reported in
markedly lower numbers. Syrian migrants
continued to be the most reported nationality in the Central Mediterranean, accounting
for almost one-third of all detections at this
border section. Their most common departure countries were Libya and Turkey.
In contrast to the usual winter decline at the
blue border, there was a marked increase in

the number of migrants arriving in the Central Mediterranean from Turkey over the last
few months of 2014. This surge was directly
related to the use of cargo ships to facilitate
mainly Syrian migrants and asylum seekers.
Between October and December 2014 eleven
cargo ships carrying more than 4 500 migrants departed with the intention to reach
Italy mainly from the area around Mersin
in Turkey.
The border between Hungary and Serbia
along the Western Balkan route has seen an
unprecedented growth in irregular migration since September 2014. Of over 25 000
irregular migrants reported on this route in
Q4, more than 60% originated from Kosovo.*
Syrian and, to a lesser extent, Palestinian and
Iraqi migrants involved in secondary movements having initially entered the EU from
Turkey added to the pressure at the Hungarian border. In December 2014, Kosovo*
citizens were for the first time the migrants
most commonly detected illegally crossing
the external border of the EU/Schengen area.
This peak in migration from Kosovo* is four
times higher than in Q2 2013, when a change
in the asylum policy of Hungary introduced
to harmonise it with EU standards led to a
spike in migration from the Western Balkans.

* This designation is
without prejudice to
positions on status,
and is in line with
UNSCR 1244 and the
ICJ Opinion on the
Kosovo declaration of
independence.

Irregular migration from Kosovo* to the EU
has been fuelled by the dire economic situation in the country and widespread rumours
among the Kosovo* population, e.g. the belief
that France’s decision to remove Kosovo* from
the national list of safe countries would allegedly make it easier to obtain asylum there.
Other rumours claimed that pregnant women
would immediately receive asylum in Europe,
or that Germany would generally issue work
permits to Kosovo* citizens.

* This designation is
without prejudice to
positions on status, and is
in line with UNSCR 1244
and the ICJ Opinion on
the Kosovo declaration of
independence.

Other factors encouraging movement of Kosovo* citizens towards the EU are linked to
cheap international bus connections from Kosovo* and to the recent introduction of additional crossing points from Kosovo* that can
be crossed with an ID card, which further facilitates their travel through Serbia.
On the Eastern Mediterranean route, detections decreased by one-third since the
comparably high summer peak of Q3 2014.
While this reduction was mainly reported
from the Eastern Aegean Sea, detections at
the Bulgarian land border with Turkey also
decreased. At this border section, however,
significantly more clandestine entries to the
EU/Schengen area were reported. During
the reporting period, the Bulgarian authorities reported twelve times as many detections of attempted clandestine entry as one
year ago, and twice as many as during the
previous quarter. This increase was also connected to additional operational and technical measures implemented along the green
border between Bulgaria and Turkey.
On the Western Mediterranean route, which
leads across the southern Spanish coast as
well as the land borders of Ceuta and Melilla,
the number of detections of illegal migration from Morocco decreased by 40% since
the seasonal peak reported in Q3 2014. The
total numbers of detections of illegal border-crossing in this region are at a similar
level as one year ago, but in contrast to Q4
2013, around two-thirds were reported from
the maritime border in spite of the adverse
conditions. Additional measures at the land
border of the Spanish exclaves of Ceuta and
Melilla significantly reduced the number of
illegal entries across the fence.
As regards illegal stay, in Q4 2014 Member States reported more detections than
in any previous fourth quarter so far. Com-

6 of 24

pared to Q3 2014, the level of detections was
only slightly lower during the reporting period. Most detections were not only made in
the western and northern European destination countries of irregular migration, but
also along the transit routes across the EU,
including in countries such as Spain, Austria, and Bulgaria. Detections of illegal stay
thus reflect the current complex picture of
irregular migration to the EU in terms of entry points, secondary routes and intended
destinations.
With 2 500 reported detections of document
fraud in Q4 2014, slightly more cases were
reported on entry to the EU/Schengen area
from third countries than during the previous quarter. However, the level of detections
is similar to one year ago.
At the air borders, Istanbul Atatürk International Airport in Turkey remained the thirdcountry embarkation airport most reported
for detections of fraudulent documents. The
increase of almost 50% compared to Q3 2014
points to a significant risk at the EU’s air borders and marks a return to the relatively high
figures recorded in the second half of 2013.
Almost one third of the cases of document
fraud on the routes from Istanbul involved
Syrian nationals travelling on fraudulent Algerian, Bulgarian or French passports.
By the same token, the number of fraudulent document cases reported on intra-EU/
SAC movements showed a slight increase
compared to Q3 2014. The most significant
growth of over 100% was related to Albanian
nationals, who were detected in the highest
numbers since the beginning of EDF data
collection. Most of these cases were related
to Albanian nationals on flights from Italy,
France, Greece, and Germany to the UK and
Ireland, predominantly using fraudulent Italian, Greek and Romanian ID cards.

1. Introduction
FRAN Quarterly reports are prepared by the
Frontex Risk Analysis Unit and provide a regular overview of irregular migration at the
EU external borders, based on the irregularmigration data exchanged among Member
State border-control authorities within the
cooperative framework of the Frontex Risk
Analysis Network (FRAN) and its subsidiary,
the European Union Document-Fraud Risk
Analysis Network (EDF-RAN).
The main purpose of the FRAN Quarterlies
is to provide:
1.	feedback to the FRAN community in the
context of information exchange;
2.	a periodic update to the situational picture of irregular migration at the EU level;
and
3.	material for constructive discussion on reporting protocols and related trends and
patterns.
This report is intended to simultaneously
serve two objectives: first, to provide a clear
summary of the situation at the external border of the EU, and second, to serve as an archive for future reference and comparative
analyses. Consistent with standard archival
techniques, some information is repeated
among sections to serve as context.
Harmonising complex, multi-source migration data among Frontex and Member States
is an ongoing process. Therefore, some of
the more detailed data and trends in this
report should be interpreted with caution

and, where possible, cross-referenced with
information from other sources. The statistics should be understood in the context of
the different levels of passenger flows passing through different border sections, the
activities undertaken by Member State border-control authorities to secure different
border sections, and widespread variation
in reporting and data-collection practices.
FRAN members, Member State risk analysis
experts and border-control authorities are
considered the primary customers of these
reports. In addition to the discussions taking place during FRAN meetings, Member
State experts are invited and actively encouraged to examine and comment upon
the data and analyses presented here. Despite all efforts of the Frontex Risk Analysis
Unit and Member State experts involved in
data exchange and analyses, it is conceivable that minor errors will occur in these reports due to very challenging timelines, and
the growing volume and complexity of data
and other information exchanged within the
FRAN community.
Due to the simultaneous release of the
Annual Risk Analysis 2015 presenting a comprehensive analysis of the situation in the
whole of 2014, the current FRAN Quarterly
(Q4 2014) is a short issue containing the statistics and only a general overview of the
developments in the reviewed period (see
Executive summary).

2. Methodology
This, the 26th issue of the FRAN Quarterly, is a
comparative analysis of FRAN data collected
between October and December 2014, and
exchanged between 31 Member State bordercontrol authorities within the framework of
the FRAN. The report presents the results of
statistical analysis of quarterly variations in
eight irregular-migration indicators and one
asylum indicator, aggregated at the level of
the event. Bi-monthly analytical reports exchanged by Member States were also used
for interpretative purposes and to provide
qualitative information, as were other available sources of information, such as Frontex
Joint Operations.
Precise definitions of Indicators 1 to 6, aimed
at harmonising the data exchanged at EU
level, were presented in the annexes of the
Q1 and Q2 reports in 2009 and so are not
repeated here.
During the June 2010 FRAN Meeting, a proposal for a harmonised definition of the return
indicator was outlined and several questions
were presented in order to motivate discus-

Monthly data on the following indicators were exchanged
among the FRAN community:
1A detections of illegal border-crossing between BCPs
1B detections of illegal border-crossing at BCPs
2 detections of suspected facilitators
3 detections of illegal stay
4 refusals of entry
5 asylum applications
6 document fraud (EDF-RAN)
7A return decisions for illegally staying third-country nationals
7B	effective returns of illegally staying third-country nationals
FRAN and EDF-RAN data used in the tables are as of 10 February 2015

sion among FRAN members in view of establishing the regular collection of monthly
return data by Frontex. Subsequently, an online survey of FRAN members was conducted
to gather information and further motivate
discussion to fine-tune the proposal for the
indicator. The 11th FRAN report (Q1 2011) was
the first to include analysis of Indicators 7A
and 7B, and the definitions of these indicators are included in an annex to that report.
Data collection commenced in January 2011.
The FRAN data-exchange has been in place
since September 2007. Data are exchanged
through the ICONet Internet platform, an interest group of the European Commission’s
CIRCA server. Member State monthly data
are based on a country template prepared by
the Frontex Risk Analysis Unit. The deadline
for submitting data for each month is the
25th day of the subsequent month, with the
exception of the end of year data, which are
requested by 15 January each year. For this
26th issue of the FRAN Quarterly, the target
for Member States to upload the monthly
data was thus 15 January 2014. In principle, data submitted subsequent to this date
will be reflected in the next FRAN Quarterly, except in cases where clarification is
needed in order to proceed with comprehensive analysis.
Following the closure of the CIREFI working
group in April 2010, most of its mandates and,
of particular relevance, the exchange of data
were transferred to the FRAN. Fortunately,
most CIREFI indicators already overlapped
with the monthly data exchange of FRAN
members. The exception was the indicator
on returns, which was added as part of the
regular data exchange within the FRAN at
the beginning of 2011.

In January 2012, the European Union Document-Fraud Risk Analysis Network
(EDF-RAN) was formed as a specialist forum to oversee the exchange and analyses
of detections of document fraud to illegally
cross the external borders, and on all international flights. Data were backdated and
joined with those exchanged under a pilot
Tailored Risk Analysis released in 2011.
The EDF-RAN data are checked for inconsistencies, and corrections are made to reported
totals to bring them in line with reported
breakdowns. Corrections are also made to
any three-letter nationality codes not present in the reference ISO list of nationality codes.*
External borders refer to the borders between Member States and third countries.
The borders between the Schengen Associated Countries (Norway, Iceland and Switzerland) and third countries are also considered
as external borders. The borders between the
Schengen Associated Countries and Schengen Member States are considered as internal borders. For the indicators on detections
of facilitators, illegal stay and asylum, statistics are also reported for detections at the
land borders between the Schengen Member
States and Schengen candidates (Bulgaria,
Cyprus, Croatia and Romania) or non-Schengen Member States (the UK, Ireland), so that
a total for EU Member States and Schengen Associated Countries as a whole can

be presented. It was not possible to make
this distinction for air and sea borders because Member States do not habitually differentiate between extra-EU and intra-EU
air and sea connections but tend to aggregate data for all arrivals.
When data are examined at the level of thirdcountry nationalities, a large percentage
usually falls under the category ‘Other (not
specified)’ or ‘Unknown’. It is expected that
the percentage reported under these categories will decrease with time as Member
States improve the quality and speed of their
identification, data collection and reporting
practices; nationalities are often reported as
‘Unknown’ if an individual’s nationality cannot
be established before reports are submitted.

Sources and Methods
For the data concerning detections at the external borders, some of the border types are
not applicable to all FRAN Member States.
This pertains to data on all FRAN indicators
since the data are provided disaggregated
by border type. The definitions of detections
at land borders are therefore not applicable (excluding borders with non-Schengen
principalities) for Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Iceland,
Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland and
the UK. For Cyprus, the land border refers to
the Green Line demarcation with the area
not under the effective control of the government of the Republic of Cyprus. For sea
borders, the definitions are not applicable for
land-locked Member States including Austria,
the Czech Republic, Hungary, Luxembourg,
Slovakia and Switzerland.
In addition, data on detections of illegal border-crossing at land, air and sea BCPs (1B) are
not available for Iceland, Ireland and Spain
and in Greece (these detections are included
in the data for Indicator 1A). Data for Norway only includes detections of illegal border-crossing at land and sea BCPs (1B), not
between BCPs (1A).
Data on detections of illegal border-crossing between sea BCPs (1A) are not available for Ireland.
Data on apprehension (FRAN Indicator 2) of
facilitators is not available for Ireland. For Italy, the data are not disaggregated by border
type, but are reported as total apprehensions
(not specified). Data for Italy and Norway also
include the facilitation of illegal stay and work.
For Romania, the data include land intra-EU
detections on exit at the border with Hungary.

24 of 24

For the data concerning detections of illegal
stay (FRAN Indicator 3), data on detections
at exit are not available for Denmark, Ireland,
Italy, Spain and the UK.
Data on refusals of entry (FRAN Indicator 4)
at the external EU borders are not disaggregated by reason of refusal for Ireland and
the UK. Refusals of entry at the Spanish land
borders at Ceuta and Melilla (without the issuance of a refusal form) are reported separately and are not included in the presented
FRAN data.
The data on applications for international
protection (FRAN Indicator 5) are not disaggregated by place of application (type of

For these countries, only the total number
of applications is reported. For France, only
asylum applications at the external borders
are reported, not inland applications. For the

Indicator 7A) are not available for Ireland,
France, The Netherlands and Sweden. The
data on effective returns (FRAN Indicator 7B)
are not available for Ireland. In addition, the
data of effective returns are not disaggregated by return operation (voluntary and
forced) for Spain. The data on voluntary effective returns (FRAN Indicator 7A) are not
disaggregated by type of return operation
(IOM assisted and others) for Belgium, Czech
Republic, Finland and the Netherlands. The
data on forced effective returns (FRAN Indicator 7A) are not disaggregated by type of return operation (enforced by Member Stated
and by Joint Operations) for Belgium, Finland,
