Frontex official publications fall into four main categories: risk analysis, training, operations and
research, each marked with a distinct graphic identifier. Risk analysis publications bear a triangular symbol formed by an arrow drawing a triangle, with a dot at the centre. Metaphorically,
the arrow represents the cyclical nature of risk analysis processes and its orientation towards an
appropriate operational response. The triangle is a symbol of ideal proportions and knowledge,
reflecting the pursuit of factual exactness, truth and exhaustive analysis. The dot at the centre
represents the intelligence factor and the focal point where information from diverse sources
converges to be processed, systematised and shared as analytical products. Thus, Frontex risk
analysis is meant to be at the centre and to form a reliable basis for its operational activities.

Executive summary
In 2014, detections of illegal border-crossing reached a new record, with more than
280 000 detections. The unprecedented
number of migrants crossing illegally the
external borders has roots in the fighting in
Syria that has resulted in the worst refugee
crisis since the Second World War. Indeed,
most of the detections at the borders concerned migrants from Syria, who later applied for asylum within the EU.
The record number of migrants detected at
the external borders of the EU had several
implications for border-control authorities
and EU internal security:
1) Most of these detections were reported
as part of search and rescue operations in
the Central Mediterranean area. In 2014,
border-control authorities saved the lives
of thousands of people. However, facilitators increasingly utilised unsafe boats,
with the inevitable result that migrants’
lives were put at risk.
2) The very high demand for illegal crossing
to the EU, fuelled by the record number of
successful entries, also led to a new modus
operandi. Since September 2014, the use of
large cargo ships to transport migrants directly from the Turkish coast near Mersin
to Italy has been reported. This is a multimillion-euro business for organised crime
groups (OCG), which is likely to be replicated in other departure countries. Another

worrying trend has been the increasing
number of deliberate attempts to involve
merchant ships in rescuing migrants. This
has prompted the International Maritime
Organization (IMO) to voice the concerns
of the shipping industry over its involvement in rescuing irregular migrants.
3) W ith record numbers of migrants crossing the border illegally, resources are devoted to their immediate care, rather
than screening and obtaining information on their basic characteristics such as
nationality. After they are rescued, they
continue their journey to other Member
States and not knowing who is travelling
within the EU is a vulnerability for EU internal security.
The profile of detected irregular migrants
remained relatively unchanged compared
to 2013, being mostly adult males. However,
the proportion of women (11%) and children
(15%) reflects the fact that many migrants
move to the EU with the intention of claiming asylum, thereby escaping violence in their
own country.
Most migrants were detected in the Central Mediterranean area, where detections
totalled over 170 000. On the Eastern Mediterranean route detections totalled over 50
800. Towards the end of 2014, detections
sharply increased at the Hungarian land border with Serbia, making the Western Bal-

5 of 68

Frontex · annual risk analysis 2015

kan route (with 43 357 detections) the third
most important irregular migration route
towards the EU.
Detections of clandestine entry in vehicles increased strongly from 599 in 2013 to 3 052 in
2014. This rise was due to a tenfold increase in
detections reported from the Bulgarian BCPs
along the land border with Turkey.
In 2014, there were just over 9 400 detections
of document fraud cases on entry to the EU/
Schengen area from third countries, which
represented a slight decrease compared to
the previous year. By contrast, cases reported
on intra-EU Schengen movements showed a
marked increase from 7 867 in 2013 to 9 968
in 2014 (+27%). Thus, for the first time, there
were more fraudulent documents detected
on intra-EU/Schengen movements than during border checks on passengers arriving from
third countries. This is partly due to the large
number of migrants undertaking secondary
movements within the EU, often with fraudulent documents obtained in the country of
their entry into the EU.
The facilitation of illegal migration remains
a significant threat to the EU external borders. Detections of facilitators rose from
7 252 in 2013 to 10 234 in 2014. The increase
was mostly due to higher numbers reported
in Spain, Italy and Bulgaria.
Member States reported more than 114 000
refusals of entry issued at the external borders of the EU, a decrease of 11% compared
to 2013. The decrease is the consequence of
the record high of 2013, when an exceptionally large number of Russians of Chechen origin were refused entry because they lacked
a valid visa.
In 2014, there were 441 780 detections of illegal stay in the EU, which represents an increase compared to the year before. Most
of the increase was due to a higher number

6 of 68

of detected Syrians and Eritreans who later
applied for asylum.
A total of 252 003 third-country nationals
were subject to an obligation to leave the
EU as a result of an administrative or judicial decision, which was a 12% increase compared to 2013.
In 2014, there were 161 309 third-country nationals effectively returned to countries outside the EU, which was broadly similar to
the numbers returned in 2013. The UK was
the Member State that conducted the largest number of returns (36 313), with steady
trends to India and Pakistan. Greece reported
an increase in effective returns, mostly of
Albanians.
As regards the wider geopolitical context,
two issues clearly stand out: the conflict in
Syria and the continued volatility in North African countries, notably Libya, from where migrants often depart in their attempt to cross
the Mediterranean Sea. The large number
of displaced Syrians in the Middle East and
North Africa suggests that Syria will likely remain the top country of origin for irregular
migrants and asylum seekers in the EU for
some time to come. In Libya, migrants are
in an extremely vulnerable situation, especially those in areas affected by the fighting.
Migrants in Libya also face arbitrary detention and very poor conditions of detention,
marked by overcrowding, poor sanitation
and exploitation.
The ongoing crisis in Ukraine will continue
to be an important factor affecting population movements. However, so far it has not
resulted in marked changes in illegal migration movements towards the EU. The main
development along the eastern land border
has been the reduction in the number of regular passengers from the Russian Federation
to the EU due to the economic downturn.

Looking ahead, the likelihood of a large number of illegal border-crossings to the EU is
high and so is the probability of a large number of migrants needing assistance in terms
of search and rescue operations (but also the
provision of international protection), in particular in the southern section of the external
border, on the Eastern Mediterranean and
the Central Mediterranean routes. Many migrants who cross illegally and apply for asylum
are not detained and thus continue making
their journey within the EU.
Most risks associated with document fraud
were assessed as high. Indeed, document
fraudsters not only undermine border security but also the internal security of the EU.

These risks are common to nearly all Member
States, as they are associated with passenger
flows and border checks, which are a specific expertise of border-control authorities.
Most cases of fraud are expected to involve
EU travel documents and there are indications of a shift away from the use of passports towards less sophisticated documents
such as ID cards and residence permits.
Overall, there is an underlying threat of terrorism-related travel movements especially
due to the appeal of the Syrian conflict to both
idealist and radicalised youths. The conflict in
Syria has attracted hundreds of foreign fighters, including EU citizens, dual-nationality
holders and other third-country nationals.

1. Introduction
The Frontex Annual Risk Analysis (ARA) 2015
presents a European summary of trends and
developments along the external borders of
the Member States of the EU. This analysis
is based on information provided to Frontex
by the EU Member States and Schengen Associated countries throughout 2014, as well
as information collected during Frontex Joint
Operations and from open sources.
The analysis starts with an overview of the
situation before the border based on data for
Schengen uniform visas. It then looks at the
situation along the external border, based on
trends in regular passenger flows, detections
of illegal border-crossing, clandestine entries
and refusals of entry. Finally, the report provides an update on the situation regarding
persons staying illegally in the EU and thirdcountry nationals returned.
Frontex operational activities aim at strengthening border security by ensuring the coordination of Member States’ actions in the
implementation of Community measures
relating to the management of the external

8 of 68

borders. The coordination of operational activities also contributes to better allocation
of Member States’ resources and protection
of the area of freedom, security and justice.
The ARA 2015 concentrates on the current
scope of Frontex operational activities, which
focus on irregular migration at the external
borders of EU Member States and Schengen
Associated Countries. In line with the concept of integrated border management (IBM),
border management should not be limited to
controlling illegal migration but also cover
threats to the EU internal security. Thus a full
section is dedicated to the analysis of crossborder crime.
The Frontex Risk Analysis Unit (RAU) would
like to express its gratitude to all members
of the Frontex Risk Analysis Network (FRAN)
in Member States for their efforts in providing data and information, as well as Europol,
EASO and the WHO PHAME programme,
which have contributed to the ARA 2015, and
all Frontex colleagues involved in the preparation of this report.

2. Methodology
Data exchange
A coherent and full analysis of the risks affecting security at the external borders requires, above all, the adoption of common
indicators. Consistent monitoring of these
indicators will then allow effective measures
to be taken on the ground.
The backbone of the ARA 2015 is the monthly
statistics exchanged among Member States
within the framework of the Frontex Risk
Analysis Network (FRAN). This regular dataexchange exercise was launched in September 2007 and then refined in 2008. Thanks to
FRAN members’ efforts, a much larger statistical coverage was achieved in 2011. Additional
requirements were added in 2014, and active
collaboration with EASO means that their
data on asylum applications are now privileged over data collected through the FRAN.
Thus, for the ARA 2015, the key indicators collected through FRAN were: detections of illegal border-crossing through the green border
or at BCPs; refusals of entry; detections of illegal stay; detections of facilitators; detections
of forged documents; return decisions and
effective returns; and passenger flow (when
available). Data on asylum applications are still
being collected within the FRAN, but increasingly Frontex relies on data collected by EASO
to analyse the situation regarding asylum.
Data on the number of EU visas issued and
their places of issue would improve the characterisation of third-country passenger flows.

© Frontex, 2014

However, this information, which is collected
within the Council’s Visa Working Party and
published by the European Commission, is
not yet available for 2014. For the purpose
of the ARA, data from 2008 to 2013 are discussed as an introduction to the general situation at the borders.
Member States were not requested to answer specific questions in support of this
analysis. Rather, bi-monthly analytical reports
and incident reports of Member States routinely collected within the FRAN were used
as important sources of information, especially as regards the analysis of routes and
modi operandi.
Open-source information was also effectively
exploited, especially in identifying the main
push and pull factors for irregular migration to
the EU. Among others, these sources included
reports issued by government agencies, international and non-governmental organisations, as well as official EU reports, such as
the European Commission’s reports on third
countries, and mainstream news agencies.
In addition, Frontex organised an Annual Analytical Review to consolidate the risk analyses presented in the FRAN Quarterlies for
2014 and also to gather knowledge on likely
risks of irregular migration at the EU’s external borders. Participants of the FRAN were
invited in January 2015 to review and comment on the risks identified at the external
borders during a one-day exercise.

Frontex · annual risk analysis 2015

The data exchange was overseen by Frontex
involving national border-control authorities.
Data were categorised by border type (land,
air and sea) and those on land borders were
additionally categorised by border section
with neighbouring third countries.
The data exchanged within the FRAN are
compiled and analysed on a quarterly basis.
Priority is given to the use of data for management purposes and to its fast sharing
among Member State border-control authorities. Member States’ data processed by
Frontex are not treated as official statistics
and thus may occasionally vary from those
officially published by national authorities.
Throughout 2014, some FRAN members performed backdated updates of their 2013 statistics. These updates have been accounted
for in this document and so some data presented herein may differ from the data presented a year ago in the Annual Risk Analysis
2014.
External borders refer to the borders between Member States and third countries.
The borders, if any, between the Schengen
Associated Countries (Liechtenstein, Norway,
Iceland and Switzerland) and third countries
are also considered as external borders. The
borders between the Schengen Associated
Countries and Schengen Member States are
considered as internal borders. For indicators
on detections of facilitators, illegal stay and
asylum, statistics are also reported for detections at the land borders, if any, between
the Schengen Member States and Member
States not yet part of the Schengen area (Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia, Cyprus) or Member
States that have opted-out from Schengen
(the UK, Ireland), so that a total for EU Member States and Schengen Associated Countries as a whole can be presented. It was not
possible to make this distinction for air and
sea borders because Member States do not
habitually differentiate between extra-EU

10 of 68

and intra-EU air and sea connections but tend
to aggregate data for all arrivals per airport.
Quality of available data
Consistent with other law-enforcement indicators, variations in administrative data
related to border control depend on several
factors. In this case, the number of detections
of illegal border-crossing and refusals of entry are both functions of the amount of effort spent detecting irregular migrants and
the actual flow of irregular migrants to the
EU. For example, increased detections of illegal border-crossing might be due to a real
increase in the flow of irregular migrants
or may in fact be an outcome of more resources made available to detect them. In
exceptional cases, increased resources may
produce a rise in reported detections while
effectively masking an actual decrease in the
flow of migrants, resulting from a strong deterrent effect.
Information on national-level resources for
border-control authorities and their allocation
is currently only partially known by Frontex.
These data are provided by Member States
themselves either within the Schengen evaluation mechanism or within the External
Borders Fund (EBF) reporting. Without systematic and reliable information on resources
allocated to border control and without estimates of irregular migration flows, it is not
possible to assess the performance and impact of the border controls put in place and
the analyses of the situation at the EU’s external borders are limited to descriptive statistics of the administrative data provided by
Member States.
Application of the Common Integrated
Risk Analysis Model (CIRAM)
A key development in the CIRAM 2.0 update released in 2011 was the adoption of a
management approach to risk analysis that

defines risk as a function of the threat, vulnerability and impact. Such an approach endeavours to reflect the spirit of the Schengen
Borders Code and the Frontex Regulation,

both of which emphasise risk analysis as a
key tool in ensuring the optimal allocation of
resources within the constraints of budget,
staff and efficiency of equipment.

3. Situational picture in 2014
3.1. P
 assenger flow across the
external borders
Passenger flow is highly correlated with the
volumes of checks that border guards have
to perform at the BCPs. The composition and
volume of passenger flow determine to a
large extent the planning and allocation of
resources that will be needed.
At a European level, there is no systematic
reporting on passenger flows by BCP, border section or as a total for the EU’s external
border. Some external indicators can be used
to raise awareness on the trend, like growth
in air traffic movements, tickets sold by ferry
companies, and the like. However, these external indicators are insufficient to properly
and rapidly highlight the trend. Despite these
shortcomings, some initiatives are being de-

veloped, such as the Smart Borders Package
currently in the pilot phase. Hopefully, this
may lead to the roll-out of an EU Entry/Exit
System that will remedy this lack of reliable
data. In parallel, Frontex and Member States,
under the Frontex Risk Analysis Network
(FRAN), have started to report passenger
flow on a monthly basis. This initiative is still
in its infancy, and the data collection is done
on a voluntary basis (13 Member States did
not report any monthly data for 2014). Nevertheless, this reporting should shed some
light on the broad characteristics of passenger flows across the external borders.
At the macro level, since 2008 two factors have
contributed to significant changes in passenger flow: the first one was the economic crisis
that translated into a decrease in passenger
flow in 2009–2010, in particular at the air bor-

der. The second was the visa liberalisation policy and local border traffic agreements that
resulted in higher passenger flows, mostly at
the land borders with Western Balkan countries, especially at the Hungarian land border
with Serbia, i.e. along the main road connection of the Western Balkans to the EU. Even
though the lack of passenger flow data does
not warrant the comparison of flows at the
land and air borders, since 2010, refusals of entry have been larger at the land borders than
at the air borders, which suggests a heavier
workload at the former type of border.
Air borders
At the air borders, Member State border-control authorities do not collect data on passengers going through border checks in a
systematic way. Some Member States have
national Entry-Exit systems in place that record the number and nationality of the passengers in detail, but most Member States
do not directly collect detailed statistics but

rely on information provided by air carriers
(flight manifests and/or API transmissions).
At the air border, data from Eurostat on extra-EU arrivals are the best approximation of
the flow of passengers, but this flow does not
correspond to the total flow of passengers
going through border checks as it does not
take into account the flow between Schengen and non-Schengen Member States.
Eurostat annual totals for 2014 are not yet
available but earlier data can also provide
some valuable insights (see Fig. 1). In 2013
compared to 2012 the increase in arrivals
requiring border checks (arrivals from third
countries, as well as between Schengen and
non-Schengen Member States and between
non-Schengen Member States) was more
pronounced (+20%) than in the case of arrivals not requiring any checks (+9%, within
Schengen Member States). This means that
border-control authorities saw their workload at airports considerably increasing in
2013. The rising trend in passenger flow is

mostly due to the growing passenger flow
on major air routes.
Third-country airports of departure to
the EU
The USA remains the main departure third
country for arrivals in the EU, representing 19% of all arrivals from third countries
in 2013 (with about 27 million passengers),
yet the largest increase was observed for
arrivals from Turkey: from about 16 million in 2012 to nearly 20 million in 2013
(+25%). In fact, two Turkish airports, Istanbul (more than 7 million arrivals) and the
leisure airport Antalya (6.5 million arrivals),
are in the top three airports for arrivals in
the EU. The largest absolute increase between 2012 and 2013 was reported for arrivals from Dubai airport, which increased
from 5.6 million in 2012 to nearly 7 million
in 2013 (+25%).
Arrivals from the Russian Federation (mostly
from Moscow Sheremetyevo airport) have
also constantly increased since 2009, to reach
a record high in 2013 with 11 million arrivals,
but this trend is expected to stop in 2014, because of the economic downturn in the Russian Federation and the depreciation of the

Information available on passenger traffic at
the external land borders of the EU is scarce.
Under FRAN data collection scheme on passenger flow, ten Member States reported
data on passenger flow at their land border on a monthly basis in 2014. Information
for some of the busiest land borders is still
missing, notably at the Bulgarian and Greek
land border with Turkey, and at the Croatian
border with Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia.
In 2014, the ten Member States reporting
data on passenger flow together totalled
about 50 million arrivals at the land borders. The traffic was the heaviest at the
borders with the Russian Federation (Norway, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania),
with about 13 million passengers. On an annual basis, passenger flow from Ukraine followed. However, through the year, these two
flows showed diverging trends, with passenger flow from the Russian Federation decreasing and passenger flow from Ukraine
slightly increasing.
Indeed, passenger flow sharply dropped at
all border sections with the Russian Federation after August 2014, as a consequence of
the economic downturn in the Russian Federation and the depreciation of the rouble
against the euro. This makes any purchase
in the EU much less accessible for Russian
customers. On the other hand, this situation is likely to favour the growth of petty
smuggling across the border. Indeed, wider
price difference in the rouble for products
like cigarettes will make it more attractive for Russian smugglers to export illegally to the EU.
In terms of nationalities, Ukrainians were
ranking first for passenger flow. The largest

increase was, however, reported for Moldovans after the introduction of visa liberalisation regime that entered into force in 2014.
Land BCP check practices and land BCPs
themselves vary widely. This sets them apart
from air borders, as airports constitute a
controlled environment where practices can
be more easily standardised. Moreover, the
rate at which traffic flows across land BCPs
are determined not only by Member States
but also by the practices of neighbouring
third countries. Bilateral cooperation is thus
fundamental to facilitating transit. Unlike at
the air border, early warnings at land BCPs
are rarely available, which limits the ability of border management authorities to
allocate resources in advance. Finally, land
borders can be subject to massive or emergency flows, for which contingency planning is necessary.

3.2. Visas
The Community Code on Visas, which entered into force in April 2010, sets out the
common requirements for issuing transit
and short-term visas to enter the territory of Member States. There are currently
over 100 nationalities that require a visa to
enter the EU, covering more than 80% of
non-EU population of the world. Nevertheless, about 1 billion nationals from approximately 40 third countries do not require an
EU visa. These include Australia, Canada,
Japan, New Zealand and the USA. As indicated in the Visa Code, statistical data are
an important means of monitoring migratory movements and can serve as an efficient management tool.
Generally, a short-stay visa issued by one of
the Schengen states (visa C) entitles its holder
to travel throughout the 26 Schengen states
for up to three months within a six-month
period. Visas for visits exceeding that period remain subject to national procedures.

The data include visas issued by the Schengen Associated Countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland), but do
not include those issued by Croatia, Cyprus,
Romania and Bulgaria, which have not yet
joined the Schengen area, nor visas issued
by the UK and Ireland, which are not part of
the Schengen area.
Data on visa issuance by Member States and
third countries of issuance are not yet available for 2014, but the European Commission,
through its Directorate-General Home Affairs, has released the data for 2013. VIS data
are collected on the basis of the place of application rather than the citizenship of the
visa applicant. Thus, for instance, applications made in the Russian Federation do not
necessarily represent only Russian nationals.
However, for the purpose of the following
overview, the country where the visas were
delivered was used as the most suitable approximation of the visas issued to citizens of
that country. Visas broken down by nationalities are available at the national level, where
they can be used for operational purposes.
In 2013, a total of 16 196 350 short-term uniform visas were issued, representing an increase of 14% compared to 2012. Most of the
visas (61%) were issued in just three countries: the Russian Federation, which alone
accounted for 43% of all visas issued in 2013,
with almost 7 million visas, as well as Ukraine
(1.5 million, 9%) and China (1.4 million, 9%).
There are, however, important differences
between these three countries in the purpose of travel and frequency of trips. Multiple-entry visas accounted for 49% of all visas
issued in the Russian Federation, but only for
13% of those issued in China. Indeed, many
Chinese applied for short-term visas as part
of their tourist package in the EU. According
to the World Tourism Organization, China is
now the leading nation in terms of tourism
expenditure worldwide, and this trend will
further consolidate.

In 2013, the Schengen Member State reporting the issuance of most short-term visas was
France (2.3 million worldwide). For the first
time, Italy (1.9 million) and Spain (1.89 million)
issued more visas than Germany (1.85 million).
The granting of visa-free regime to Moldova
in 2014 considerably increased passenger
flows, but in contrast to the situation in the
Western Balkans did not result in an increase
in asylum applications.

3.3. Detections of illegal
border-crossing between
BCPs
In 2014, detections of illegal border-crossing reached a new record, with more than
280 000 detections. This was twice as many
as the previous record of 140 000 detections
in 2011, the year of the Arab Spring. This unprecedented number of migrants crossing illegally the external border has roots in the
fighting in Syria that have created the worst
refugee crisis since the Second World War. Indeed, most of the detections at the borders
concern migrants from Syria, who later applied for asylum within the EU.
The unprecedented number of migrants detected at the external border of the EU had
several implications for border-control authorities and EU internal security:
1) Most of these detections were reported as
part of search and rescue operations in the
Central Mediterranean area. In 2014, border-control authorities saved the lives of
thousands of people. Not all could be saved
unfortunately, as facilitators have increasingly chartered unsafe boats, stretching
to the limit the capacities of surveillance
and rescue.
2) The very high demand for crossing to the
EU has also created new modus operandi.
Since September, there has been an in-

creasing use of large cargo ships to transport migrants directly from the Turkish
coast near Syria to Italy. This is a multi-million-euro business for OCG, which is likely
to be replicated in other departure countries. Another worrying trend has been the
increasing deliberate attempts to involve
merchant ships to rescue migrants. This
has prompted the International Maritime
Organization (IMO) to voice concerns over
the involvement of the shipping industry
in rescuing irregular migrants.
3) W ith a record level of migrants crossing
the border illegally, resources are devoted
to their immediate care, but not towards
screening and obtaining information on
basic characteristics like their nationality.
As migrants quickly continue their journey to other Member States, increasing
the movements of persons staying illegally within the EU, this puts the EU internal security at risk.
Similarly to last year, most of detected migrants were adult men (see Fig. 2). However,

Detections of Afghans sharply increased from
about 9 500 in 2013 to more than 22 000 in
2014. Afghans were detected on the Eastern
Mediterranean route (mostly crossing the
Eastern Aegean Sea), and then once again
on the Western Balkan route.
Detections of citizens from Kosovo* crossing the land border illegally between Serbia
and Hungary sharply increased in November
and December 2014. This trend coincided
with rumours among Kosovo*’s population
that it would be now easier to obtain asylum in the EU. By the end of the year their
detections totalled 22 069.

the proportion of women and children reflects the fact that most migrants are seeking asylum in the EU, escaping violence in
their own country.
Indeed, Syrians alone (79 169) represented
more than a quarter (28%) of the total as
shown in Figure 3. They were also the top
nationality for other indicators, in particular asylum applications, reflecting the dire
situation in Syria and the desperate plight
of Syrian asylum seekers. However, the vast
majority of Syrians did not apply for asylum
in the Member States of entry but rather in
other Member States for many different reasons, notably because they expect to receive
more attractive welfare benefits.
Regarding Eritreans, their detections in 2014
reached a record level (more than 34 500,
compared to 11 300 in 2013). They were mostly
arriving through Libya on the Central Mediterranean route. Like Syrians, they did not
apply for asylum in the Member States of entry, but rather continued to other Member
States. Many of the Eritreans stated that they
had lived for some time in Libya but decided
to leave because of the violence.

In 2014, more than 170 000 migrants arrived irregularly in the EU through the Central Mediterranean route (see Fig. 4). As in
2013 and in 2011, the Central Mediterranean
route was the main area for illegal bordercrossing into the EU, representing 60% of
all detections in 2014. Detections were the
largest between June and September at over
20 000 per month, but throughout the year,
monthly detections were larger than in 2013.
Most migrants were Syrians and Eritreans departing from the Libyan coast.
The vast majority were rescued by bordercontrol authorities after issuing a distress
call; however, despite best efforts there were
many fatalities. Smugglers typically make
use of frail, overcrowded boats, with limited
fuel available to maximise their profits, putting migrants’ lives at considerable risk. The
role of the Italian Navy and the JO Hermes/
Triton was crucial in rescuing an unprecedented number of migrants. Despite these
efforts, around 3 400 people died or went
missing at sea in 2014 and around 2 800
since the beginning of July according to UNHCR estimates.

Besides naval assets, civilian vessels have
been increasingly involved in the detection
and rescue of migrants at sea (see Fig. 5). According to the International Maritime Organization (IMO), more than 600 merchant ships
have been diverted from their routes to rescue persons at sea in 2014. These deviations
are, in the words of the Secretary General,
detrimental to shipping and are not offset
by any realistic prospects of salvage awards.

In addition to migrants leaving from Libya,
since September 2014, an increasing number
of cases have been reported of cargo vessels
being used to smuggle migrants from Turkey directly to Italy. This new trend affects
the Eastern Mediterranean route, as the departure area, and the Central Mediterranean
area, as the arrival area. This practice is further developed under the section related to
the Eastern Mediterranean route.

As migrants were rescued in high-sea, they
were reported as part of the Central Mediterranean route. Many were disembarked in
Apulia and Calabria, to alleviate the burden on
reception capacity in Sicily. From a statistical
point of view, these disembarkations artificially inflated the number of migrants usually
reported on the Apulia and Calabria route. In
2014, there were fewer migrants departing
from Egypt and targeting this area of the Italian coast than in 2013.
Nationalities
Once rescued, migrants declare their nationality and this information is used to determine the main countries of origin. Since June
2014, due to the large number of migrants
arriving, this information has been either
slowly or partially reported under the heading ‘sub-Saharan’ for many migrants coming
from Africa (26 340, or 15% of arrivals in the
Central Mediterranean in 2014). Migrants’
declarations of nationality are also increasingly difficult to validate, as they often lack
travel documents and, with border-control
authorities working under increasing pressure there are fewer possibilities to check
their validity.

Since data collection began in early 2008,
the Eastern Mediterranean has maintained
its status as a hotspot of irregular migration (see Fig. 6). In 2014, 50 800 detections
were reported from the area, representing
18% of the EU total. This was twice as many
as in 2013, mostly due to a sharp increase in
detections in the Aegean Sea (from 11 829 in
2013 to 43 377 in 2014). Detections remained
comparatively much lower at the Bulgarian
and Greek land borders with Turkey (12 262 in
2013 and 5 938 in 2014).
Sea border
Aegean Sea
Compared to the previous year, the sharp increase in the Aegean Sea in 2014 meant that
migrants departed from more areas, and also
arrived on a larger number of islands. While
the islands reporting the largest number of
arrivals remained Lesbos, Chios and Samos,
detections were also reported from small islands from North to South, stretching capacity of surveillance. Many migrants claimed
to be Syrian, and were thus handed an administrative notice allowing them to stay in
Greece for up to six months, even without
applying for asylum.
Screening processes of some migrants revealed a high degree of falsely claimed nationalities to avoid return. Not knowing the
nationality of migrants who are illegally
crossing the border and travelling within
the EU is evidently a vulnerability for EU internal security.

The presence of the screening teams also has
a preventive effect. Migrants aware of being
screened tend to state their true nationality.
This could be indirectly established when comparing the proportion of migrants reporting to
be Syrians in islands where screening teams
were active, with their proportion in islands
where no screening teams were present. In
2014, out of the total of 18 662 migrants arriving in Lesbos and Samos, two islands with
screening teams, 36% declared to be Syrians. By
contrast, over the same period, out of 14 802
migrants reported in the islands of Kalymnos,
Kos, Leros, Limnos, Patmos, Rhodes and Symi,
seven islands without screening teams, 86%
declared being from Syria.

Since August 2014 the number of irregular migrants arriving in the Central Mediterranean
from Turkey sharply increased compared to
earlier in the year and to the same period in
2013. This sharp increase was directly related
to the use of cargo ships to facilitate migrants
and asylum seekers from Turkey to Italy (for
example, see Fig. 7).
To date, Mersin has been the place where those
wishing to travel to the EU in an irregular fashion have made contact with the smuggling
networks. Wooden boats, however, have departed from various points along south-eastern Turkish coast such as Mersin, Adana and
Hatay provinces to reach cargo vessels waiting off shore.
Smuggling migrants from Turkey on board
large cargo vessels is extremely profitable, and such funds are likely to be an important source of income for smuggling
networks also engaged in other criminal
activities. This means that the criminal
networks might be financing other criminal activities by exploiting and putting at
risk vulnerable groups of displaced families from Syria.

Specifically, the cargo ships, which are often bought as scrap, tend to cost between
EUR 150 000 and 400 000. There are often
as many as 200–800 migrants on board, each
paying EUR 4 500–6 000 for the trip, either
in cash a few days before the departure or
by Hawala payment after reaching the Italian coast. The cost is high because the modus
operandi is viewed as being safe and has been
demonstrated as being successful.

certain, they point to the fact that a certain
proportion of migrants who entered illegally
went undetected.

Hence, the gross income for a single journey
can be as high as EUR 2.5 or even 4 million
depending on the size of the vessel and the
number of migrants on board. In some cases,
the profit is likely to be between EUR 1.5 and 3
million once other overheads such as recruiters, safe houses, shuttle vessels, crew and fuel
have been taken into account. Given this level
of financial gain it is important to act against
this modus operandi not only to stem the flow
of irregular migration but also to limit the financial assets of the smuggling networks.

The Western Balkan route remained largely
a function of the transiting flow of migrants
that enter the EU at the Greek-Turkish borders and later continue towards other Member States through the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia and Serbia. This is
reflected in the large number of detections
of Afghans and Syrians at the Hungarian land
border, whose number increased five-fold
compared to 2013, like they increased in the
Aegean Sea.

n Western Balkan route
For the second year in a row, detections in
the Western Balkans strongly increased, from
6 391 in 2012, to 19 951 in 2013 and 43 357 in
2014.

In Bulgaria, as a consequence of increased Bulgarian operational measures, including an Integrated Border Surveillance System (IBSS) and
a special police operation, the level of detections decreased compared to 2013 and tended
to be mostly reported from the eastern part
of the border, not covered by the IBSS.

However, nearly half the detections were citizens of Kosovo*, representing a distinct flow
of migrants in the Western Balkans. Their
detections surged from less than 1 000 per
month before September 2014, to more than
9 000 in December. This ten times increase
in a few months is one of the sharpest recorded in the FRAN data, comparable to pace
of the increase in the Central Mediterranean
that peaked in the summer. This trend could
partly be attributed to rumours among the
Kosovo* population that after France decided
to remove Kosovo* from the national list of
safe countries it will be much easier to obtain asylum in that Member State.

In Greece, while detections at the green border
and at BCPs were low, some migrants were
reportedly hiding in vehicles detected on the
highways inside Greece. Similarly, some interviews with migrants conducted in Italy indicated that they had entered illegally without
being detected at the border. While the reliability of these interviews is difficult to as-

During 2014 most detected individuals immediately applied for asylum. As a result asylum applications in Hungary mirrored the
increase in pressure at this border section,
increasing to unprecedented levels for this
country – more than 43 000 applications
submitted in 2014, about half being submitted by Kosovo* citizens. These migrants were

Land border
Compared to detection at the sea borders,
detections at the Bulgarian and Greek land
border with Turkey have been much lower,
totalling less than 6 000 detections.

only attempting to cross the green border
into Hungary, rather than attempting to enter via the BCPs, as there is no indication of
increased refusals of entry or use of fraudulent documents at any of the BCPs between
Hungary and Serbia.
Despite the apparently tight relationship between illegal border-crossing and applications
for asylum, it is not supposed that all migrants
crossing this border section immediately ap-

plied for asylum in Hungary, as asylum applications submitted by citizens of Kosovo* also
increased in Germany over the same period.
This means that, for most migrants, Hungary
is not their final destination and they will continue their journey through the Schengen area.
It also means that, to avoid later return to Hungary, migrants will increasingly attempt to
avoid detection at the border, and only apply
for asylum in Hungary as a last resort option
if detected by border-control authorities.

n C
 ircular route between Albania and
Greece
In 2014, Greece reported 8 841 detections
of illegal border-crossing at its land border
with Albania and with the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia, of which 8 757 were
associated with Albanians. This represented
a stable trend compared to the previous year.
Prior to visa liberalisation in 2011, detections
at this border section had ranged between
38 000 and 30 000 a year.
The introduction of visa liberalisation went
together with a small increase in refusals of
entry as more Albanians crossed the border
at BCPs. However, in 2014 refusals of entry
decreased at this land border compared to
2013, probably due to the decreasing flow of
seasonal workers to Greece. Indeed, many
Albanians are attempting to travel to other
Member States than Greece, as reflected in
their increasing refusals of entry, notably due
to document fraud, in several Member States.
These trends may reflect a general migration
trend for Albanians within the EU.
n Western Mediterranean route
In 2014 there were 7 842 detections of illegal border-crossing in the Western Mediterranean region, which consists of several
areas of the southern Spanish coast and the
land borders of Ceuta and Melilla. This total
shows an increase of 15% compared to the
total of 6 838 reported in 2013.
Like in 2013, the first half of 2014 showed most
detections being reported at the land border,
mostly from Melilla. Indeed, the Spanish authorities reported several violent attempts to
cross the fence.
As mitigating measures, the fence has been
upgraded. As a result, in the second half of
the year, Spain reported more detections at
the sea border than at the land border.

24 of 68

Once in Melilla, migrants are turned over to
Spanish Police Headquarters for identification, and many are transferred to the Temporary Centre for Immigrants (CETI – Centro
de Estancia Temporal de Inmigrantes). However, this centre only has a limited capacity
and some migrants had to be transferred to
mainland Spain.
In terms of nationality, most of the migrants
are from Western Africa, in particular from
Cameroon and Mali. Algerians and Moroccans
have also been reported among the top ten
nationalities, but mostly at the sea border.
Since November 2014, Spain also reported
an increase in detections of illegal bordercrossing of Syrians at the land border (more
than 250 in November and December), then
applying for asylum. This increase, combining with increasing detections of Syrians using forged document to enter to the EU, has
prompted Spain to open asylum and international protection offices at the borders of
Ceuta and Melilla in March 2015.
n Black Sea route
Detections of illegal border-crossing on the
Black Sea were extremely rare. However,
since 2013, Bulgaria and Romania have reported an increasing number of detections,
totalling 433 migrants in 2014.
These incidents still constitute isolated cases,
and are possibly linked to the increased surveillance on the Eastern Mediterranean route
and the increasing number of migrants waiting in Turkey to reach the EU illegally.
n Eastern land border route
The eastern land border route is, in effect,
an amalgam of detections of illegal bordercrossing reported by Finland, Estonia, Latvia,
Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania. Despite the total length of all the bor-

der sections, detections on this route tend to
be lower than on other routes, possibly due to
the long distances between major hubs and
many countries of origin. Also, according to
several reports shared during 2014, visa fraud
and counterfeit border-crossing stamps tend
to predominate on this route, as opposed to
detections of illegal border-crossing.
Detections of illegal border-crossing remained
stable, with 1 275 detections (compared to
1 316 in 2013). In 2014, most detections were
reported at the land border between Lithuania and Belarus. Most of these detections
were of Vietnamese nationals arriving after
transiting through Belarus.
By contrast to other routes, a large proportions of these detections were connected
with the smuggling of goods rather than irregular migration. Several Member States
also mentioned migrants or smugglers crossing the border illegally undetected, but these
events are believed to be rare.
Detections of illegal border-crossing are also
kept at low levels along the eastern land
border thanks to the surveillance efforts of
neighbouring third countries, in particular
the Russian Federation and Belarus. Most
part of the border with Belarus is fenced on
the Belarusian side.
Regarding the border with Ukraine, Frontex
monitors the situation, but in 2014 no important changes have been noticed. Detections
for illegal border-crossing remains insignificant along all green border section with
Ukraine and the number of refusals of entry remained comparable to previous years.

3.4. Clandestine entries
Detections of clandestine entry in vehicles
increased strongly from 599 in 2013 to 3 052
in 2014. The increase was due to a tenfold
increase in detections reported from the

Bulgarian BCPs along the land border with
Turkey. The increase started in August, possibly as an indirect consequence of enhanced
measures at the green border that might have
caused a partial displacement of the flow
from green border to BCPs, by way of clandestine entries. At the neighbouring Greek
border section, BCP Kipi, data on clandestine entries is not collected on a systematic
basis, but detections were much lower than
at the Bulgarian border (see Fig. 8).
Clandestine hiding in vehicles was also reported in large numbers by Croatia and Hungary at BCPs along their land borders with
Serbia, as well as on exit from Bulgaria to Serbia in transit to Hungary. The migrants For
Croatia, 2014 was the first complete year of
reporting, so comparison with previous year
are not relevant. However, in Hungary, detections doubled compared to last year, in
line with increasing pressure at the green
border. This means that the Hungarian authorities are facing considerable challenges,
having to deal with larger passenger flow in
the wake of visa liberalisation in the Western
Balkans, increased detections of illegal border-crossing and clandestine entries.
Spain reported 340 clandestine entries in
2014, at the BCP with Morocco in Melilla. This
was the first annual report, so comparison
with previous years is not possible.
Clandestine entry requires migrants to stay
in confinement for long periods of time, and
is known to put migrants’ lives at risk of suffocation and dehydration. Therefore, most
of the migrants detected hiding in vehicles
at BCPs are single young males, rather than
more vulnerable family groups.
Compared to detections of illegal bordercrossings (283 500), the number of detected
attempts at clandestine entry (3 052) appears
very low, in particular considering the large
volume of vehicle traffic, particularly lorries.

It is thus reasonable to assume that detections underestimate the actual number of
clandestine entries.

3.5. Document fraud
In 2014 there were just over 9 400 detections of document fraud cases on entry to
the EU/Schengen area from third countries,
which represents a slight decrease compared
to last year.
The introduction of the new security features
into travel documents and the development
of the new automated border-control systems did not translate into a significant decrease in the use of fraudulent documents.
Fraudsters appear to have changed their modi
operandi and instead of the simple alterations,
tend to use more sophisticated methods.
Routes
The air borders remained the border type reporting the largest number of detections of
document fraud in 2014, but on a decreasing
trend compared to 2013 (-10%).
Considering all detections of fraudulent documents at the air borders in 2014, Istanbul
Atatürk (IST) international airport in Turkey

26 of 68

remained the most reported last embarkation
airport from third countries, even if the overall number of document fraud cases dropped
down by almost 40% compared to 2013.
Murtala Muhammed (LOS) international airport in Lagos, Nigeria remained the second
most common embarkation point of detected
document fraudsters. In fact document fraud
detections on flights to EU/Schengen countries increased by almost 20%. The majority of document fraudsters were Nigerians.
Other often reported last embarkation airports were located in Brazil, most notably
Rio de Janeiro (GIG) and Fortaleza (FOR).
Document fraud from these airports significantly increased.
For one-third of all detections made at the
air borders on entry to the EU/Schengen area
and involving passengers arriving from third
countries the last embarkation airport was
unknown (meaning not reported under the
EDF data collection).
Detections of document fraud at the land
border increased by 16% between 2013 and
2014, but remained significantly smaller than
at the air borders (see Fig. 10). The increase at
the land border was driven mainly by a sig-

nificant rise in document fraud detections
at the Spanish-Moroccan land border section, involving almost exclusively Syrian and
Moroccan nationals. The detections of Syrians using fraudulent documents to enter the
EU by land border section between Morocco
and Spain appeared for the first time in 2014.
Detections of document fraud also increased
significantly at the land border between Bulgaria and Turkey (by 30% compared to 2013)

mostly due to a larger number of detected
Iraqi nationals. Detections also increased
(+20%) at the land border between Hungary
and Serbia, with mostly Serbian, Albanian
and Kosovo* citizens detected using fraudulent documents at this land border section.
At the sea borders, fewer cases were reported. Almost half of the cases were connected to Moroccan nationals detected in
Ceuta (Spain).

increasing from 1 200 detections in 2013 to
over 1 400 detections in 2014 (see Fig. 11). In
addition, more than 2 200 detections, representing a 70% increase compared to 2013
were also detected on intra-EU/Schengen
movements, making Syrians by far the most

Claimed EU nationals detected with fraudulent documents rose by almost 20% from 945
fraudulent cases in 2013 to 1 140 fraudulent
cases in 2014 including all travel types. Most
detections were made on intra-EU/Schengen movements, often starting on Greek islands but the largest increase, by almost 50%
compared to 2013, was recorded on entry to
the EU/Schengen area from third countries.
Travel documents
Fraudulent passports were mostly detected
on entry from third countries (4 953) followed
by visas (1 616), residence permits (1 506), ID
cards (1 414), stamps (1 047) and other documents (233). The overall decrease compared
to 2013 was led mainly by the decrease in detections of fraudulent border stamps followed
by residence permits and visas. The biggest
increase was recorded in case of fraudulent
ID cards. Most of the fraudulent documents
detected on intra-EU/Schengen movements
were ID cards (5 067) (+30% compared to
2013). Regarding impostors, most were using authentic EU passports.

Member States reported a total of more than

the record high in 2013 when an exceptionally

large number of Russians of Chechen origin
were refused entry due to a lack of visa and
then applied for asylum in Poland and Germany before overstaying in the EU. This modus
operandi became less popular in 2014 thanks
to successful media campaigns supported by
Germany aimed at quelling the widespread
rumours in Chechnya that it was possible to
enter Member States without a visa and easily receive asylum once there.

As shown in Figure 12, since 2011, more refusals
of entry were issued at the land border (56%)
than at the air borders (40%). This is due to
the increase in passenger flow at land borders following visa liberalisation in the Western Balkans, and the subsequent increased
role of border-control authorities in checking
entry requirements, which was previously the
responsibility of consular authorities who issued the visa. At the same time, at the air border most refusals of entry used to be issued to
citizens of Latin America. However, since this
region has been enjoying economic growth
and better employment rate since 2010, there
has been a decrease in the number of passengers refused entry at the EU’s external border.
Indeed, since 2009 (with the exception of 2013
when Russians of Chechen origins ranked
first), most of the persons refused entry at
EU borders were Ukrainians. Albanians have
been ranking high since 2011, in the wake of
the visa liberalisation. In particular, Albanians are now ranking first for refusals of entry at the air border. Altogether, citizens of
Western Balkan countries granted visa-free
regime accounted for 25% of all refusals of entry at the external border, or 28 140 persons.
As in previous years, the main reasons for refusals of entry were the lack of a valid visa
(30%) and the lack of appropriate documentation justifying the purpose of stay (21%).
The number of persons refused entry due
to an alert in the SIS represented only 2% of
the total, with 2 753 refusals issued in 2014.

3.7. Detections of illegal stay
In 2014, there were 441 780 detections of illegal stay in the EU, which represents a generally increasing trend compared to the year
before and recent reporting periods. However, in the following analysis of detections
of illegal stay it has to be borne in mind that
the Netherlands, since 2012, due to technical
reasons, reported only detections on exit and
not those inland, which in 2011 amounted to
about 6 000. Also in Sweden, for administrative reasons, many asylum applicants were
also reported as illegal stayers, raising the
total number of detections of illegal stay in
Sweden. Finally, data from Croatia cover the

fer to the period between July and December
2013, after the country joined the EU.
The vast majority of illegal stayers were detected inland (383 507 detections, or 86% of
the total) and so are presumed to be long
term over stayers as they were making no

attempt to leave at the time of detection.
The next most common location for detections of illegal stayers was the air borders
on exit (33 789 detections) followed by the
land borders (15 345 detections) where illegally staying migrants were leaving the EU
or the Schengen area.

Figure 15. Detections of illegal stay in 2014 with percentage change on 2013

In terms of nationalities, the large number of
Syrians detected staying illegally is artificially
inflated by detections in Sweden and some
other Member States as it includes people
not meeting requirements for staying legally
before they apply for asylum.
Looking at detections over the past few years,
Moroccans stand out as one the main na-

tionalities detected staying illegally (above
20 000 annual detections between 2009
and 2014), although their detections at the
external borders remain much lower. This indicates that Moroccans tend to cross the external borders legally, but then exceed their
legal period of stay within the EU. The same
applies to Algerians, although in lower number (above 10 000 annual detections for il-

legal stay between 2009 and 2014). Afghans
have also ranked high among the top nationalities since 2009.

3.8. Returns
In 2014, there were 252 003 third-country nationals subject to an obligation to leave the
EU as a result of an administrative or judicial decision, which was a 12% increase com-

Much of the change between 2013 and 2014
was due to an increase in return decisions issued by Spain, from 7 410 in 2013 to 40 386 in
2014. This increase in the number of return
decisions did not concern any nationality in
particular, but was spread among all nationalities, suggesting an increased use of return
when detecting migrants illegally.
Effective returns
In 2014, there was a steady trend of 161 309
third-country nationals effectively returned
to countries outside the EU (see Fig. 16). The
UK was the Member State conducting the
largest number of returns, with steady trends
of returned nationals from India and Pakistan.
Greece reported an increase in effective returns, mostly of Albanians.

pared to 2013. The absolute total number of
migrants subject to return decisions is still
underestimated by this indicator, as data on
decisions were unavailable from, inter alia,
France, the Netherlands and Sweden, which
only reported effective returns but presumably issued a high number of decisions.

It is difficult to evaluate the overall cost-effectiveness of return measures in comparison with other practical measures taken to
reduce irregular migration. Forced returns
are recognised as being more costly than
voluntary returns, although Member States
highlight the importance of return flights
(including those co-ordinated by Frontex)
in ensuring an effective return, as well as
having a deterrent effect for future irregular migrants.
Within the number of effective returns to
third countries in 2014, 40% were reported
to be on voluntary basis and 43% were forced
returns, while for 17%, the type of return was
not specified (see Fig. 16).

In terms of nationalities, there is a striking
difference between the nationality detected
crossing the border illegally or staying illegally
in the EU, and the nationality effectively returned (see Fig. 17). Indeed, most people detected crossing the border illegally apply for
asylum and thus are not returned.

3.9. Facilitators
The facilitation of illegal immigration remains a significant threat to the EU. Detections of facilitators rose from 7 252 in 2013
to 10 234 in 2014. The increase was mostly
due to increases reported in Spain, Italy
and Bulgaria.
The facilitation of irregular migrants by sea
is carried out using increasingly diverse modi
operandi, which often put the lives of migrants
at risk. The Central and Eastern Mediterranean routes are particularly affected by growing and sustained flows of irregular migrants
facilitated to the EU using various types of
vessels. The recent incidents of large cargo
vessels containing several hundreds of migrants is evidence of this evolution.
Organised Crime Groups (OCGs) provide facilitation services to an ever-increasing number of irregular migrants seeking to reach the
EU. These OCG activities sustain and exacerbate the large-scale influx of irregular migrants to the EU. Driven by a profit-incentive,
these OCGs callously disregard the safety and
human rights of migrants. Large and increasing numbers of facilitated irregular migrants
enter the EU along Europe’s Mediterranean
coast and engage in secondary movements
to countries of final destination.
Irregular migrants are also facilitated to enter the EU by air relying on fraudulent documents. Other modi operandi include marriages
of convenience as well as the abuse of visas/
overstaying. However, it is difficult to quantify the scope of these activities.

OCGs provide various facilitation services for
irregular migrants enabling the entry into the
EU, secondary movements within the EU and
the transition to legal stay in Member States.
Most OCGs operate on an international level
relying on contacts in countries of origin and
within diaspora communities in transit and
destination countries. The proportion of facilitated irregular migrants remains difficult
to assess.
Facilitation services related to the illegal immigration to the EU and secondary movements between Member States are in high
demand and generate significant profits for
the OCGs involved. People smuggling is a
growing market prompting existing OCGs
and criminals to adapt their business models and shift from other criminal activities to
the facilitation of illegal immigration.

3.10. Cross-border crimes
Frontex promotes and coordinates European
border management with a special focus on
migration flows. In application of the concept
of Integrated Border Management, it additionally supports Member States in combating organised crime at the external borders,
including the smuggling of goods and trafficking in human beings. However, due to the legal and institutional national characteristics,
border-control authorities along the external borders of the EU have different types and
degrees of responsibilities in the fight against
transnational crimes. The nature and extent
of inter-agency cooperation at the external
borders thus differs greatly between Member
States. Regarding the prevention of smuggling
of illicit goods, border-control authorities of
certain Member States play only an assisting
role, while border-control authorities in other
Member States share their tasks with customs
or are able to conduct investigations. Because
of these differences, cross-border crime data
reported by some national border guard insti-

33 of 68

Frontex · annual risk analysis 2015

tutions are partial and frequently do not include data collected by customs.
On the other hand, identifying cross-border
movements of persons involved in criminal
activities or victims thereof is a crucial task
of border-control authorities. Either in the
case of human trafficking or the travel of voluntary fighters with a jihadist background,
border agencies are confronted with new
challenges particularly in the field of international and inter-agency cooperation, profiling, identification, and assistance to victims.
3.10.1. Smuggling of illicit drugs
Cannabis from the Western Balkans and
North Africa

* EMCDDA (2014),
European Drug Report:
Trends and Developments,
p. 17ff.

** UNODC (2014) World
Drug Report, p. 37

The EU is the destination of several main
routes for various narcotic drugs, coming from
different regions of the world including Latin
America, the Western Balkans, West Asia
and North Africa. The EU also plays a role of
a transit point for drugs destined for other
regions. According to the EMCDDA European
Drug Report 2014*, 80% of drug seizures in
Europe were for cannabis in 2012, although
indicators point to a trend of decreasing use.
Cannabis is smuggled into Europe in the
form of two distinct products, cannabis resin
(‘hashish’) and herbal cannabis (‘marijuana’).
The main provider of cannabis resin to Europe is Morocco, although its production capacities are in decline. Spain as an entry door
for cannabis resin from Morocco reported
around two thirds of the total quantity of
resin seized in Europe in 2012.
Within the last years, the number of seizures
of herbal cannabis have been increasingly
exceeding resin seizures. The shift towards
herbal cannabis was predominantly caused
by an increase of domestic production in
many European countries. This means that
trafficking of cannabis products across the

34 of 68

EU external borders has decreased, with the
domestic production increasingly satisfying
national demand. An exception seems to be
trafficking activities in southeast Europe,
where mainly Albanian cannabis supplies
the customer demand in countries such as
Greece, Italy, Slovenia, and Hungary.
Cocaine from South America
According to EMCDDA calculations based on
seizure data, cocaine shows to be the third
most intensively smuggled drug in Europe after cannabis resin and herb. In 2012, around
77 000 seizures of cocaine amounting to
71 tonnes have been reported by Member
States.* The number of seizures increased
between the mid-1990s and 2007, but have
been declining since 2009. Reported quantities in contrast have been slightly increasing
in 2011 and 2012, mostly because of seizures
made in transit countries including Spain and
Belgium. Some of the cocaine seized in the
EU was in fact destined for emerging markets in third countries such as the Russian
Federation.
The drug is almost entirely produced in Bolivia, Colombia and Peru, with the latter
having substantially increased its supply to
Europe.** Cocaine is smuggled from South
America to the EU across the Atlantic by
sea and air. Large shipments travelled by sea
and air from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela to
Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, and increasingly also Belgium. Cocaine is smuggled by air
freight, on pleasure boats and through container shipments, but to a large extent also
by individual airline travellers.
In October 2014, the European Commission
adopted two reports concluding that Colombia and Peru meet the criteria to start negotiating agreements allowing their citizens
visa-free access to the Schengen area. An introduction of short-stay visa waiver agree-

ments for citizens of Colombia and Peru,
however, might allow OCGs to intensify their
use of individual cocaine couriers.
Although a majority of shipments of cocaine
continue to enter the EU through Western
Europe, a diversification of trafficking routes
away from the very dominant routes to the
Iberian Peninsula drew a larger share of cocaine to the ports of the Balkans and the
Black Sea. Between 2009 and 2011, four
tonnes of cocaine have been seized in Bulgaria, Greece, Romania and Turkey, accounting for 2% of the overall number of seizures
reported in Europe.* Bulgarian and Romanian authorities have moreover reported an
increased role of Nigerian OCGs in the trafficking of cocaine to these countries.**
Heroin from Afghanistan, Iran and
Pakistan
Seizure numbers and statistics on treatment
of drug addicts suggest that heroin use in Europe has been decreasing over the last decade. Five tonnes of heroin were seized in 2012,
which represents only 50% of the amount reported by Member States in 2002.*** Most
of the heroin consumed in the EU is produced
in Afghanistan and, to a lesser extent, in Iran
and Pakistan. It is transported along a variety of routes to Europe, including the Balkan
route, which runs through Turkey and the
Balkan countries, the Northern route, which
heads through Central Asia and the Russian
Federation, and increasingly the Southern
route via the Persian Gulf by sea, sometimes
including passages through Africa.
In 2014, European border guards deployed
along the Balkan route reported seizures totalling 86.4 kg of heroin – more than three
times as much as in 2013. The largest quantities were seized at the BCP Kapitan Andreevo at the Bulgarian-Turkish border and
at departure from the Greek ferry port of
Igoumenitsa.

New psychoactive substances
New psychoactive substances comprise
a wide range of drugs that are in many cases
not yet under control of national or international drug legislation. In 2013, the Early
Warning System of the EMCDDA and Europol
listed a total of 81 new synthetic substances.
Although new psychoactive substances represent only a small share of the illicit drugs
market, they are particularly dangerous because limited information about their effects on the human body is available. These
substances often come in the form of more
openly sold ‘Legal Highs’, thereby giving the
false impression of legality and lower consumer exposure to physical and mental health
risks. Most new psychoactive substances or
their precursors arrive in shipments from
China or India.
The challenges for law-enforcement authorities at the external borders of the EU lie
within the development of capacities to identify the rapidly developing diversity of new
psychoactive substances. Drug control legislative measures within the EU also need a
more coherent approach to prevent the exploitation of differences and gaps between
national jurisdictions. The sale of new psychoactive substances through the internet and
anonymised networks and the fact that manufacturers, retailers and other parts of the
market chain are located in different countries pose additional challenges. In 2013, the
EMCDDA has identified 651 websites shipping ‘legal highs’ to European consumers.****

The detection of persons trafficked for sexual exploitation, forced labour or other purposes represents a major challenge for border
authorities, as victims themselves are often
not aware of their fate when they arrive in
the transit or destination countries.

In 2014, Eurostat presented its second statistical working paper on THB at EU level, including data on the years 2010–2012. It allows
a more long-term comparison with data presented in the first edition of the report, which
starts with numbers of 2008. Within five
years, the number of identified victims, male
and female, registered by police, NGOs and
other agencies in the Member States increased from 3 691 in 2008 to 4 443 in 2012.*
As Eurostat points out, more reported cases
are not necessarily related to a higher number of actual victims. The upward tendency
may also be caused by an improved reporting rate of the phenomenon.
Data disaggregated by types of exploitation in
2012 show that a majority of 66% of the victims were trafficked for the purpose of sexual
exploitation and 20% for labour exploitation.
14% were trafficked for forced begging, criminal activities, removal of organs and other
purposes. Compared to previous years, the
figures point to a clear trend towards a growing share of victims identified for sexual exploitation (2008: 58%), and fewer for labour
exploitation (14%).
Important for border guards at the external
borders is the fact that only a minority of
35% of registered victims came from non-EU
countries in the years 2010–2012 (EU victims
mainly come from Romania and Bulgaria). According to Eurostat, the main third countries
of origin in 2012 were Nigeria, Vietnam as an
emerging origin country, China, Albania, Brazil, Ukraine, Philippines, Sierra Leone, Dominican Republic and Cameroon. Notably, the
number of victims from Asia has increased,
with victims from the Philippines being registered in bigger numbers for the first time,
and Vietnamese victims peaking, mainly for
the purpose of labour exploitation. The reemergence of victims of THB from Albania
in 2012 may be connected to the visa liberalisation for Albania by the end of 2010. On
the other hand, victims from Nigeria were

consistently strongly represented between
2008 and 2012.
3.10.4. Smuggling of weapons
The effective control of firearms is crucial in
the fight against crime and it is clear that European law-enforcement authorities inland
and at the external borders need to cooperate
across the EU in the fight against trafficking
of firearms. The threat emanating from the
crime is measured not simply by the smuggling of the weapons but of the further crimes
and damage they enable. The terrorist attacks of 7–9 January in France and successive
police operations showed the availability of
military-grade arms including AK-47s rocketpropelled grenade launchers on European
illicit markets. Many of these weapons are
illegally traded from former conflict regions
such as the Western Balkans, where in Bosnia and Herzegovina alone around 800 000
weapons are estimated to be in illegal civilian possession.**
Taking into account increasing passenger flow
and heavier workload of border guards at the
EU external borders, and constantly evolving
and refining modi operandi of weapon smugglers, the risk of seeing this criminal activity
at the EU external borders is increasing. EU
funding and action have been put in place to
complement the work of Member States in
addressing this phenomenon and to improve
their capabilities in preventing these criminal
ambitions and averting illicit weapons entering the EU.***
Smuggled arms might be employed to facilitate organised crime groups involved in the
trafficking of human beings, facilitation of
illegal immigration, illegal drugs trade and
more. Arms trafficking might also be linked
to such crimes as corruption, falsification of
documents, money laundering and thefts from
not sufficiently secured weapon storages or
ammunition stockpiles outside the EU. Ter-

In case of firearms seizures it is important to
distinguish if the weapon was only trafficked
for criminals’ protection – e.g. smuggling
drugs, stolen vehicles – or if it was intended
to be smuggled to the EU. The differences in
legislation among Member States and between third countries and Member States
create legal loopholes that might be exploited
for the secondary distribution of weapons
within the EU. Lack of firearms deactivation
standards and ease of converting gas, alarm,
signal and pneumatic guns imported legally
to the EU into lethal weapons adds additional
risk. Legal channels of distribution of weapons might also be abused (arms trade, legal
weapon transits and purchases).
3.10.5. Exit of stolen motor vehicles
According to Eurostat, the total number of
vehicles including cars, motorcycles, buses,
lorries, construction and agricultural vehicles stolen in the EU has been steadily falling between 1998 and 2010. In 2013, statistical
data published by UNODC counted more
than 750 000 vehicles stolen in 29 of the EU
and Schengen Associated Countries, compared to 1.4 million in 2005.* Among the reasons for the decline were the advanced
technical protection technologies developed
by the producers and intensified international
law-enforcement cooperation.
Only a small share of the vehicles stolen in
the EU are detected at its external borders,
often in the context of Frontex Joint Operations. In contrast to the overall theft statistics, detections at the borders reported to
Frontex showed a decrease from 519 in 2013
to 487 in 2014. These cases included cars, lor-

rorist groups might also seek weapons from
criminal groups to be used in attacks staged
in the EU. Presumably, criminal groups explore already existing smuggling routes used
for other criminal phenomena for smuggling
small arms and light weapons.

ries, trailers, boats, excavators, agricultural
machines and motor bikes.
Most car thefts were detected by querying
SIS II, the Interpol and national theft data
with the Vehicle Identification Numbers (VIN)
specified on the engine, frame and major
parts of most motor vehicles. Car thieves applied various modi operandi to cloud the identity of their stolen vehicles at the external
borders. Reports indicated frequent manipulation of the VIN, or departure from the EU
with rental or very recently stolen cars before
authorities are notified of the theft. In other
cases, vehicles were disassembled into parts
to obscure identification or vehicle registration papers were counterfeited.
The brand preferences did not change during the last years, as more than 40% of the
private vehicles detected were produced by
Mercedes Benz, Volkswagen and BMW. A
majority of the persons driving the stolen
vehicles on exit from the EU were nationals
of the country which they intended to enter.
For example, 70% of the persons caught with
a stolen vehicle at the borders with Ukraine

Most excise goods smuggled across the
EU external borders are tobacco products.
According to estimates of the European
Commission, the illicit trade in tobacco products costs the EU and its Member States
EUR 10 billion a year in lost tax revenues. Not
only individual consumers and small scale

smugglers from economically weak border
regions try to make use of existing price differences. Large scale criminal businesses illicitly import cigarettes especially to Western
European markets from as far away as Asia.
In 2014, many governments increased the
taxes on excise goods to improve their budget
situation. Between January 2013 and July 2014,
22 Member States increased their excise duties on cigarettes, in average by EUR 0.10 per
pack of cigarettes.*

Figure 20. Average cigarette prices (pack of 20) in the EU and neighbouring third countries

Source: European Commission (prices in Member States) and open sources (prices outside the EU)

Currently, a customer would pay EUR 5 for an
average pack of cigarettes in Finland, whereas
across the Russian border, the same good
would cost him only around EUR 1. A new
law would see a 40% increase in the minimum price for cigarettes by 1 April 2015, but
that price hike was already compensated by
the recent loss in value of the Russian rouble against the euro. The negative economic
growth in the Russian Federation is expected
to increase the illicit trade of tobacco products to the EU, by both individual ‘ant-smugglers’ from the border regions and OCGs.

On 9 January 2014, the Protocol to Eliminate
Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products, was closed
for signature by the Parties to the WHO
Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. At this time, it was signed by 53 States,
including 15 Member States, and by the EU.
The Protocol will enter into force 90 days after the 40th ratification. To assist in the investigation of illicit cross-border trade in tobacco
products, it requires States to implement a
global tracking and tracing regime through
unique, secure and non-removable identification markings, such as codes or stamps on

39 of 68

Frontex · annual risk analysis 2015

cigarette packages. Within the EU, this and
other measures for public health are implemented through the revised Tobacco Products Directive, which entered into force on
19 May 2014 and will apply after a transposition period of two years.
A tracking system that assists law-enforcement authorities in determining if cigarettes
were traded illegally was already agreed upon
between the EU and the four largest tobacco manufacturers, which cover 80% of the
world market. Through these agreements the
companies committed themselves to sell to
legitimate clients only. However, smaller companies outside the EU currently still sell large
quantities to third-country markets where
only an insignificant share of these cigarettes
can be absorbed by the local demand. Much
of the rest is then smuggled out to Member
States. In particular seizures of ‘cheap white
brands’ have been showing a strong upward
tendency over the past years. An example is
the Jin Ling cigarette brand produced in Kaliningrad, which grew so popular among western consumers that this brand itself started
to be counterfeited.

3.11. Asylum applications
Data on asylum applications are not related
to law-enforcement activities, but provides
contextual information on movements of persons towards the EU. The analysis of asylum
applications for international protection provides useful information on the push and pull
factors at play in mixed migration flows. It is
also important for border-control authorities
because they are often the first authorities
prospective applicants meet, before being referred to asylum authorities. Border-control
authorities also play a role in the implementation of the Dublin system. As mentioned in
recital 3 of the Eurodac Regulation (and in recital 4 of the recast Eurodac Regulation), for
the purposes of applying the Dublin Regulation, it is necessary to establish the identity

40 of 68

of applicants for asylum and of persons apprehended in connection with the unlawful
crossing of the external borders.
Finally, unfounded applications for international protection inevitably delay the examination and subsequent provision of protection
for those third-country nationals with genuine claims. When applications are made after an unsuccessful attempt to illegally enter
the territory (illegal border-crossing, document fraud, refusal of entry, clandestine entry), it overloads border-control authorities
and dilutes allocated resources.
In 2014, Frontex has developed its collaboration with EASO, which notably contributed
to the analysis of the data on asylum applications, based on the data they collected
through their newly established network.
Approximately 615 000 applicants for asylum
(+41% compared to 2013) were registered in
2014, which marked the highest level received
in the EU since EU-level data collection began in 2008. 90% of applicants people applying for the first time in the EU.
The main nationalities of applicants were
Syrians (over 120 000) and those of Western Balkan countries (>107 000 considered
together). After a sudden rise in the number
of applications at the beginning of spring,
Eritrea became the second most common
country of origin of asylum claimants in the
EU and Schengen Associated Countries, with
over 40 000 applicants in 2014. Significant
(over 50%) increases were also seen in applications from citizens of Pakistan and Afghanistan. The situation in Ukraine caused a
particularly significant change in relation to
previous years. A total of over 14 000 claims
were received in 2014 in the EU – a 14-fold
increase compared to 2013 – but the applications were not limited to countries bordering
Ukraine, but spread across all Member States.
In parallel, many Ukrainians sought alterna-

tives to asylum via family reunification or visas and residence permits for work.
Compared to last year, 21 Member States reported more applications for international
protection than in 2013. Among these, three
Member States, all of which are located at the
EU external borders, saw particularly sharp
rises: Italy (+146%), Hungary (+125%) and Bulgaria (+54%).
EASO’s new Early warning and Preparedness
System (EPS) data collection, which started in
March 2014, includes the numbers of implicit
withdrawals of asylum applications: this covers cases where a person applies in a Member State and then absconds and is no longer
contactable by the Member State. Many of
such persons later apply again for international protection in another Member State
and may eventually be returned in accordance with the stipulations of the Dublin III
Regulation. From the initial data it appears
that the proportion of asylum applications
that are implicitly withdrawn is particularly
high (above 30% of all applications) in several
States at the EU external land border (Poland,
Latvia, Croatia, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia

and Lithuania). Notwithstanding a more detailed analysis of the links between bordercrossing indicators, asylum applications and
withdrawn applications, this pattern might
indicate potential misuses of the asylum procedure whereby an individual may make an
application for international protection in order to circumvent obligations applicable to
regular border-control.
This can also be an issue with those arriving
in an irregular manner by sea. Large numbers
of potential applicants for asylum can lead to
severe difficulties in registration. In summer
of 2014 legal and administrative questions
led to the non-fingerprinting of some asylum-applicants in Eurodac in Italy leading to
the non-application of Dublin for those who
absconded from reception centres in Sicily
and other areas and then travelled north to
lodge asylum claims in other Member States.
Italy resolved this issue by issuing instructions to Questure to take fingerprints of all
arrivals even forcibly, if necessary, after the
correct legal interpretation issue was clarified by the Commission and Member States
in the autumn.

4.2. R
 enewed Internal Security
Strategy

The 2015 European Commission programme
of work was adopted in December 2014 and
set out the main actions the Commission intends to take throughout the coming year.
Included here was the European Agenda on
Migration, the objective of which is to develop a new approach to legal migration to
make the EU an attractive destination for
talents and skills, as well as to improve the
management of migration by intensifying
cooperation with third countries, fostering
burden sharing and solidarity and fighting
against irregular migration and smuggling.
The agenda includes the review of the Blue
Card Directive, the EU-wide work permit for
highly skilled workers.

The EU Strategic Guidelines for the Justice and
Home Affairs Area were adopted in June 2014
and included a call for the renewal of the EU
Internal Security Strategy (ISS) by mid-2015
as part of the efforts to promote operational
police cooperation and to prevent and combat serious organised crime, including human
trafficking and smuggling, as well as corruption. Furthermore, the Council Conclusions of
December 2014 on a renewed Internal Security Strategy call for an update of the EU IBM
Concept. The European Commission will, on
the basis of opinions given by the European
Parliament and the Council of the EU, present a Communication on the renewed ISS
by spring 2015. The five strategic objectives
which were agreed upon for the initial ISS will
remain as priorities. These objectives are: the
disruption of international criminal networks;
the prevention of terrorism and addressing
radicalisation and recruitment; raising levels of security for citizens and businesses in
cyberspace; strengthening security through
border management; and increasing Europe’s
resilience to crises and disasters.

The Commission Communication on the
Work Programme states:
‘To tackle the growing pressure at our
external borders the Commission is developing a European Agenda on Migration, which will balance a fairer and
responsible approach to legal migration, in order to make the EU an attractive destination for talent and skills, with
firm measures against irregular migration and people trafficking and smuggling. Improving the management of
migration means better linking our migration policy with our external policy,
fostering greater internal and external
cooperation, offering protection to persons in need, based on responsibility and
solidarity and preventing tragic events
such as those recurrently happening in
the Mediterranean.’

EU Passenger Name Record
proposal
In February 2011, the Commission presented
a proposal for an EU Passenger Name Record (PNR) Directive. The proposal would
oblige Member States to set up PNR systems
and establish strict data protection safeguards for the processing and collection of
PNR data from flights to and from the EU.
The Commission has declared its commitment to ensuring the proposal, which should

include high fundamental rights protection for EU citizens, gets adopted. The European Commission, European Parliament
and the Council are currently in negotiations to this end.

4.4. N
 ew Schengen Evaluation
Mechanism
Preparations are ongoing as regards the implementation of the new Schengen evaluation mechanism. In line with Regulation
1053/2013 establishing an evaluation and
monitoring mechanism to verify the application of the Schengen acquis, the standard
evaluation questionnaire was adopted in July
2014. In October, the annual evaluation programme for 2015 was approved on the basis
of the multi-annual evaluation programme
2014–2019, taking into account the risk analysis provided by Frontex as well as information made available by relevant EU agencies
and bodies such as Europol and the Fundamental Rights Agency. The first evaluations
under the new mechanism (concerning announced visits) started in February 2015 in
Austria. In the meantime, a particular focus
has been put on further developing training
for the evaluation experts, including updating the existing training curricula by including
aspects that have not been covered previously, such as return.

4.5. EUROSUR Handbook
The first edition of the EUROSUR Handbook,
as required by Article 21 of the EUROSUR Regulation, was agreed upon by the end of 2014
in meetings between the Member States, the
Commission and Frontex. The Handbook will

provide technical and operational guidelines,
recommendations and best practices, including on cooperation with third countries. The
European Commission shall adopt the Handbook in the form of a recommendation in the
course of 2015.

4.6. Roll-out and impact of Visa
Information System
The Visa Information System (VIS) will be
rolled out, region by region, until all Schengen states’ consulates worldwide are connected. So far, the VIS has started operations
in North Africa in October 2011; in the Near
East in May 2012; in the Gulf region in October 2012; in West and Central Africa in March
2013; in East and Southern Africa in June 2013;
in South America in September 2013; and in
Central and South East Asia and in the occupied Palestinian Territory in November 2013.
The year 2014 saw the introduction of the VIS
in Turkey and the Western Balkans.
A new timetable was agreed upon for the final VIS roll outs during 2015. The latest time
frame for the roll-out in regions 17–23 is as
follows:
n	June 2015 for region 17 (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine);
n	September 2015 for region 18 (the Russian
Federation);
n	October 2015 for region 19 (China, Japan, Mongolia, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan);
n	November 2015 for region 20 (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri-Lanka), 21 (Andorra, Holy See,
Monaco, San Marino), 22 (Ireland and the
UK) and 23 (Schengen Member States).

Progress reports on Kosovo*, Turkey and
Georgia were published. Whilst the second
progress report regarding Kosovo* notes good
progress, the Commission considered that
further efforts are required to obtain visafree travel for Kosovo* citizens. Turkey’s first
progress report on fulfilment of the visa liberalisation roadmap was presented by the
Commission on 20 October 2014. The Commission’s second progress report on Georgia’s implementation of Visa Liberalisation
Action Plan (VLAP) has concluded that the
first-phase requirements of the visa dialogue
have been met and the second phase where
implementation of benchmarks will be reviewed can therefore be launched.
In 2014, an amendment to Regulation
539/2001 was adopted which included additional 17 countries (16 Pacific and Caribbean island nations** and the United Arab
Emirates) to the list of third countries whose
nationals are exempt from the EU visa requirement. However, before this exemption
can come into force the Commission must
negotiate visa waiver agreements with each
of these 17 countries. The processes for the
various countries are currently ongoing and
once negotiations are completed, they will be
submitted for approval to the European Parliament and Council. Following this, and once
the ratification procedures are completed in
both the EU and the concerned third country, the visa waiver agreement will enter into
force for the citizens of those countries, thus
enabling visa-free travel. Negotiations for the
various countries are at differing stages, but
it is hoped that the visa-free travel for these

countries will become a reality at various
points in 2015. It is unlikely that visa-free status for these 17 countries will bring any additional risks in terms of migration and security.
In the aforementioned amendment of Regulation 539/2001, Peru and Colombia were also
included in the visa-free list. Following this,
on 29 October 2014 the Commission adopted
two reports concluding that Colombia and
Peru met the criteria to start negotiating
agreements allowing their citizens visa–free
access to the Schengen area. They are now
preparing a recommendation for a mandate
from Council to open negotiations on the
visa waiver. Once granted, the Commission
will begin negotiations with both countries.
Only after the short-stay visa waiver agreements enter into force will visa-free travel
for the citizens of these countries become a
reality. This could happen, at the very earliest, in the second half of 2015.
The EU-Ukraine Association Agreement was
signed in late 2014. Among other rules, the
deal provides for greater movement of workers and sets targets for establishing a visafree travel regime and aligning the two sides’
regulatory systems by laying down detailed
timetables for Ukraine to transpose parts of
the EU acquis legislation into its national laws
and put them into effect.
As a result of the Statement of the Heads of
State or Government on Ukraine of 6 March
2014 following the violation of Ukrainian
sovereignty and territorial integrity by the
Russian Federation, the visa liberalisation
dialogue with the country was suspended.

4.8. State of play concerning
the ‘Smart Borders
Package’ (entry/exit
system and the registered
traveller programme)
The proposal for a Smart Borders Package
was first examined by the European Parliament and Council in February 2014 and
there they voiced technical, operational and
cost concerns, mainly related to the overall
feasibility of the proposed new systems. To
counter these, the Commission subsequently
initiated the proof of concept exercise which
consisted of two stages.
The first stage, consisting of a Commissionled Technical Study aimed at identifying and
assessing the most suitable and promising
options and solutions, was completed by
late 2014. The results of which then fed into
the second stage of the proof of concept: an
eu-LISA run pilot project. This pilot project
which will last for most of 2015 is aimed at
verifying the feasibility of the options identified in the Technical Study and validating the
selected concepts for both automated and
manual border controls. This Pilot will be undertaken at various border crossing points of
volunteering Member States/Schengen Associated Countries.
Once the results of this pilot project are published by the end of 2015, legislative deliberations will restart in the European Parliament
and the Council. However, it is not expected
that any eventual system would be in place
at the borders before 2020.

4.9. Recast Eurodac Regulation
The amendment of the Eurodac Regulation
to allow law-enforcement authorities to consult the Eurodac database for the purpose of
prevention, detection or investigation of terrorist offences and of other serious criminal
offences was adopted in 2013. The new rules

will only become applicable though from 20
July 2015. The comparison of fingerprints in
the possession of Member States’ designated
law-enforcement authorities and Europol
against those stored in the Eurodac database
will only be possible where such a comparison is necessary in specific cases, under welldefined circumstances and conditions, and
following prior checks of other databases.

4.10. Asylum Procedures
Directive changes
The recast asylum acquis package brought
about significant changes to the previous
framework. Its updated requirements created a new environment for asylum systems
of participating Member States and will continue to transform them as remaining transposition deadlines approach in July 2015.
Of particular relevance are the revisions to
the Dublin system, new rules regarding access
to procedure, as well as a revised framework
concerning border and accelerated procedures, including the situation of vulnerable
applicants and applicants in need of special
procedural guarantees.*
The revised Dublin Regulation** is already
applicable and it introduces additional guarantees to persons in a Dublin procedure (obligatory personal interview and information
on the procedure for establishing the Member State responsible, extended options for
reunifying family and relatives, and additional
guarantees for minors, including best interest of a child determination and family tracking). The transfer to the Member States
responsible under Dublin can now be appealed and a motion for suspensive effect of
the appeal may be submitted (granting the
right to remain within the territory while the
court is determining the motion for suspension). Legal assistance free of charge is to be
provided upon request and the overall duration of detention is strictly limited. More pre-

cise deadlines are introduced for procedures

revised form, also covers applicants who could
otherwise fall under the Return Directive as
irregular migrants and be returned as such.
* The recast Eurodac
Regulation will take
effect on 20 July 2015.

The revised Eurodac Regulation* improves
data protection standards and sets new time
limits for transmitting fingerprint data to the
central unit of Eurodac. National police services and Europol can access Eurodac data for
the purposes of comparing Eurodac data with
fingerprints linked to criminal investigations
(though only if specific requirements are met,
and only as concerns the most serious crimes
as a last resort after checking other available
databases. There is no possibility to share information with third countries).
Article 6 of the recast Asylum Procedures Directive (APD) clarifies the responsibilities of
state authorities in regard to ensuring access
to the asylum procedure for those wishing to
make an application, in particular the necessity for states to register all expressions of
intent to apply made to whichever national
authority is the first point of contact for the
potential applicant. Article 8 stipulates that
training must to be provided to officials who
may come into contact with persons seeking
international protection (in particular during the surveillance of land or maritime borders or during border checks) so that they
are able, inter alia, to provide information on
where and how an application can be lodged.
The recast APD also states clearly that persons present in the territorial waters of a
Member State who made an application for

46 of 68

international protection should be disembarked on land and have their applications
examined. Moreover, the conditions and safeguards for applying border and accelerated
procedures have now been clarified and, in
particular, the grounds under which such
procedures can be applied have been made
exhaustive.
New rules regarding identification and treatment of vulnerable groups have been put in
place in the recast Reception Conditions Directive (obligation to conduct an individual
assessment to identify the particular reception needs for vulnerable persons and ensure
access to psychological support, legal assistance and information, as well as restrictions
on detaining vulnerable persons, including
minors). Applicants in need of special procedural guarantees, e.g. due to their age, disability, illness, sexual orientation or traumatic
experiences, should be identified in due time
and provided with adequate support such as
sufficient time to make their claims in line
with provisions of the recast APD. In practical terms, those new requirements combined
may substantially limit the use of border and
accelerated procedures with regard to certain groups of applicants.
The recast Reception Conditions Directive
also sets forth rules concerning qualifications
required of the representatives of unaccompanied minors. This may be particularly relevant for Member States experiencing high
numbers of unaccompanied minors who abscond after lodging an application, which
may be linked to child trafficking and child
smuggling.

5. Outlook
Based on the descriptions of the situation in
2014 and a review of the main factors, be it
economic, legal or technical, that can contribute one way or another to irregular migration
to the EU, this chapter reviews the possible
evolution of the situation along the external
border of the EU in the coming years. While
some developments are likely to materialise, others seem possible, based on current
knowledge. Finally, past experiences demonstrate that there are a large number of unforeseeable events and factors that can have
a profound and unpredictable impact on the
situation at the border.

5.1. I llegal border-crossing
expected to remain
concentrated in southern
and south-eastern borders
of the EU
The best forecasts – those likely to materialise and have a direct bearing on the situation
at the external borders – are the continued
use of the Mediterranean area as the main
crossing points for irregular migration. At
the same time, border-control authorities
are expected to be increasingly engaged in
search and rescue operations covering vast
areas of the Mediterranean Sea, as well as
being the first interlocutors for a growing
number of persons presenting themselves
at the EU borders in search of international
protection.

Irregular migratory flows are expected to
follow known routes from North Africa and
the Middle East to the EU, mostly by sea and
through the south-eastern land border via
Turkey. The main uncertainties concern the
timing, as well as the size and composition
of the flows. The composition and/or the size
of the flow will vary in response to the developing situation in North Africa and in the
Middle East, particularly in Syria and neighbouring countries.
Swift diversification of modi operandi, possible displacement between routes or border
types, and escalating attempts to evade detection or identification are all likely to occur
in response to enhanced surveillance.
Based on the location of the main countries
of origin for irregular migration to the EU for
the past five years, the border areas that are
most likely to deal with illegal border-crossing
remain the Southern Mediterranean coast,
and the borders with Turkey. Migrants living
in or having relatively easy/facilitated access
to Turkey and/or North Africa will continue
to be overrepresented in the flow of irregular migrants to the EU. In particular, departures of sub-Saharan migrants from Libya
across the Central Mediterranean to reach Italy and arrivals of Syrians crossing the border
illegally to apply for asylum in the EU – two
phenomena already present in 2013 and 2014
– are likely to continue in the near future.

47 of 68

Frontex · annual risk analysis 2015

In addition, the increasing likelihood of family units crossing the border, means that border-control authorities need to be prepared
to manage flow of vulnerable people, including numerous children. This makes it necessary to focus on the further development
of specific mechanisms and procedures to
tackle the needs of this vulnerable group at
the EU external borders, including all air, land
and sea borders.
Central Mediterranean area
In the Central Mediterranean, many areas on
the North African coasts may be used as departure points for illegal border-crossing to
the EU. North African countries may be used
as transit countries for migrants from more
southern African countries to sail across the
Mediterranean. They may be used as transit
by migrants from many different countries of
origin, which complicate further predictions
in terms of volume. However, with Egypt and
Algeria now requiring visa for Syrian nationals,
these countries are no longer practical transit countries on the way to Libya, the typical departure point in 2014. Turkey has no
such visa requirements for Syrian nationals
and this country may now become the main
country of departure.
The increasing complexity of irregular arrivals
are expected to absorb significant resources.
The broadening of the surveillance area along
with increasing trend in boats seeking assistance, result in border assets being increasing mobilised in support of search and rescues
activities. In addition, the profits generated
by the use of old cargo ships for smuggling
migrants may increase their use, including in
the Central Mediterranean.
Eastern Mediterranean area
On the Eastern Mediterranean route, enhanced surveillance along the land borders
with Turkey has resulted in a displacement

48 of 68

on the Eastern Aegean Sea. This is expected
to put further pressure on the limited local
reception facilities for undocumented migrants. The large number of migrants expected to cross illegally the external borders
will also undermine systematic screening and
debriefing activities. Nationality swapping is
expected to remain an issue.
In addition, an increasing number of migrants
from North Africa and the Middle East are expected to transit to Turkey via the air border, before attempting to cross illegally the
border to the EU, also by using forged document. Istanbul airport (IST) is an important
hub for irregular migrants travelling by air to
several Member States, with continuous increase in passenger flows for the past several
years and Turkish Airlines’ expansion strategy
towards Africa and the Middle East. Turkish
airports are thus likely to remain common
embarkation points for irregular migrants
arriving in the EU.
As a consequence, the number of migrants
undertaking secondary movements through
the Western Balkans is also expected to rise.

5.2. Increased workload at the
border
Regular passenger flows across the external
border will increase significantly in the coming years due to rising global mobility. Visa
liberalisation processes and local border traffic agreements are placing also increasing responsibilities on border-control authorities.
Increasingly, while movements across the
external air borders are managed through a
layered approach, where the border is divided
into four components (in departure countries, at embarking airports, at the border
and after border-crossing), the physical border is increasingly becoming a secondary layer
for risk assessment, meaning that checking
and screening start well before passengers

cross border-control posts at airports. Border
management will increasingly be risk-based,
to ensure that interventions are focused on
high-risk movements of people, while lowrisk movements are facilitated smoothly.

of specific fraudulent techniques to fool biometric checks, like spoofed fingerprints, is
also likely to increase.

Air travel environment is becoming more
complex with the growth of low-cost carriers. In addition, advances in travel complexity and increasing sophistication of criminal
activities result in increasing workload for
border-control officers and increasing difficulties in developing planes and passengers
risk assessments.

Overall, there is an underlying threat of terrorism-related travel movements especially
due to the appeal of the Syrian conflict to
both idealist and radicalised youths. The
conflict in Syria has attracted thousands of
foreign fighters, including EU citizens, dualnationality holders and other third-country nationals.

In addition, the EU continues to receive a
high number of asylum seekers. A substantial number of economic migrants appear
to use the asylum procedure to try entering
or staying on the territory of the EU. Their
first interlocutors are often border-control
authorities.

Turkey has become the country most often
used by foreign fighters to enter or exit Syria
primarily because of its geographical location plus the availability of legal and cheap
travel options.

5.3. I ncreased abuse of
fraudulent breeder*
documents
Given the increasing level of security features
in modern travel documents and stricter migration policies across Member States, the
misuse of genuine travel documents (which
includes impersonation and fraudulently obtained documents) is likely to be an entry
method which will steadily rise.
Some of these issues will be addressed by the
Visa Information System (VIS), which is operational and used by issuing authorities in 11 regions as of November 2013, and will be rolled
out to additional regions in 2014 and 2015.
The systematic check on arrivals of VIS visas is likely to result in increased abuse of
fraudulent breeder documents required to
obtain genuine VIS, as well as EU passports
which do not require systematic biometric
controls at the border. In addition, the use

5.4. Movement of terrorists

It is possible that foreign fighters use irregular
migration routes and/or facilitation networks
(irrespective of whether this is recommended
by terrorist structures or not), especially when
the associated risks and costs are perceived
as low in comparison to legal travel options.
Frontex is not in a position to identify, nor
does it have any information that suggests,
any nexus between terrorist travel and irregular migration routings and/or facilitation
networks. Nonetheless, it cannot be excluded
that EU-based fighters change their modi operandi of travel when faced with administrative and/or legal measures upon their return;
or that may be reluctant to return home in
fear of reprisal, which may induce them to
resettle elsewhere.

5.5. Health risk assessment
The main focus of Frontex is on strengthening border-control cooperation to facilitate
bona fide migration management, combat
cross-border crime and prevent threats to
the Member States. This includes the pre-

49 of 68

Frontex · annual risk analysis 2015

vention of threats to public health, as defined
by the International Health Regulations of
the World Health Organization. For the first
time, the Annual Risk Analysis 2015 presents
the WHO Regional Office for Europe’s review of the potential public health risks associated with the migration phenomena and
ways to adequately address them, prepared
under the project ‘Public Health Aspects of
Migration in Europe’ (PHAME).
As human mobility in Europe rises, health
security attracts increasing attention as
a means of safeguarding the health of the
population. Health security has been traditionally considered a domestic concern.
However, the public health challenges of human mobility and large migration have been
as well recognised as foreign policy matters,
claiming for a need of international cooperation to safeguard public health as a global
common good. The analysis of health risks
requires an overview of the health hazards
arising in the countries of origin and transit, at the border and within the countries
of destination.
Migrants are exposed to a number of different health risks during the migration process.
However, the impact of the journey varies
depending on the category of the migrant,
undocumented migrants being among the
most vulnerable given the often harsh conditions of the journey and the limited access
to health services. The following analysis,
therefore, focuses on undocumented migration. The public health aspects of migration
affect both health care and non-health care
workers involved in the various stages of the
migration process, as well as resident communities. In the countries of destination, migration often streches the capacity of health
care systems to adapt to the additional demand for health services, and the unfamiliar and changing health profiles and needs.
Due to the common lack of proper preparation and information, the health risks posed

50 of 68

by migrants are often overestimated by the
receiving communities.
5.5.1. Migrants
Pre-departure
The risk of acquiring vaccine-preventable diseases depends on the presence of susceptible
individuals in the population and their epidemiological profile. In many countries of origin and transit the health care systems are
weakened by civil unrest, wars, economic
crisis and natural disasters. The provision of
public health services including vaccination
to the population is often interrupted or even
withheld, resulting in a dramatic reduction
of the immunisation coverage. For instance,
in the Syrian Arab Republic, the immunisation coverage has fallen from 91% registered
in 2011 to 68% in 2012. Although efforts have
been made to improve immunisation coverage, there are still deep concerns on the immunisation status of Syrians, including those
asking for asylum in European countries.
In countries with high tuberculosis (TB) incidence and prevalence, large portions of the
population have a status of latent TB infection that can be developed to TB disease, often contagious, in case of decreased immune
response. Such situation may be created by
the hard conditions of a journey which may
start before crossing the border of the country of destination.
Travel and transit
Health risks at this phase vary depending on
the conditions and duration of the travel. The
conditions to which migrants are exposed to
during the journey as well as in the countries
of destination put them at risk of sexual victimisation, violence and sexual ill-health. Refugees, asylum seekers and undocumented
migrants, especially women, infants and children, were identified as the most vulnerable

ones. Other risks arising throughout the journey and specially during rescue operations
include drowning, traumatism, burns, hypothermia, dehydration, heatstroke, foodborne
diseases, respiratory and skin infections.
Host community
At reception centres, overcrowding and inadequate hygiene and sanitary conditions coupled with limited access to health care are
well known risk factors for acquiring a variety of communicable diseases. The risk of
measles, diphtheria and whooping cough is
enhanced in the presence of susceptible individuals. Furthermore, scarce hygiene and
sanitary conditions increase the risk of gastro-intestinal and skin infections.
Mental health disorders and chronic diseases
can be left undiagnosed and untreated, leading to further deterioration of the health
condition of the migrants, even after reaching their destination. Even if chronic diseases
are detected during the first screening procedures, lack of communication between reception centres where migrants are transferred
to may cause the suspension of treatments
with serious consequences. Potentially long
and unspecified periods of stay, unclear legal
status, communication difficulties and pasttraumatic experiences expose the migrants
to mental health risks.
Social, economic and political factors in origin and destination countries influence the
risk of HIV infection of migrants. Isolation and
stress may lead migrants to engage in behaviours – such as unsafe casual or commercial

sex and drug use – which increase HIV risk.
This risk is exacerbated by inadequate access
to HIV services and fear of being stigmatised
for seeking HIV-related information or support. Female migrants may be particularly
vulnerable to HIV and susceptible to exploitation and/or physical and sexual violence.
Migrants in a vulnerable situation may experience poor housing and working conditions,
as well as limited access to health services,
which may cause TB infection or the reactivation of a previous TB infection into disease.
Same conditions can be cause of delays in diagnosis and premature interruptions of their
treatment, which eventually could develop
into a multi-drug resistent form of TB. Proper
education and complete access to culturalsensitive quality and supportive services are
of paramount importance.
5.5.2. Workforce at the border and in
the reception centres
Health risks for health and non-health workforce vary depending on the resistance and
vulnerability of each individual, the working
conditions as well as the potential exposure
to biological agents. Rescuers may be exposed
to trauma, injuries, hypothermia, drowning
and heatstroke during rescue operations. Due
to their difficult working conditions, psychological support to the workers both at the
border and in the migration centres is also
relevant. Adequate screening procedures focused on communicable, non-communicable
diseases as well as mental health should be
performed when required and with full respect to human rights.

6. S
 elected recommendations
for risk mitigation
In an EU migration environment characterised by increasing pressures at the borders
coupled with often decreasing resources for
their handling, the challenge for border-control authorities is to become more effective
and efficient whilst maintaining the necessary
quality standards. Risk analysis must then be
able to provide both short- and longer-term
recommendations for decision makers. The
following chapter provides a concise description of a selection of areas where risk mitigation initiatives could take place. Clearly there
exist many areas where this could be recommended but the following chapter consists of
one selection of issues identified and chosen
on the basis of the Frontex risk analysis carried out throughout this year. The objective
of this chapter is to ensure high-level awareness of selected areas for potential action and
can serve as a practical example of how to
follow on from risk analysis into corresponding risk mitigation decisions.

6.1. Security aspects of border
management

* Regulation (EC) No
562/2006, Schengen
Borders Code, Recital 6

Given the threats visible at the external borders of the EU, it is evident that border management has an important security
component. Indeed, according to the Schengen Borders Code, officials at the borders are
charged with helping to ‘combat illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings
and to prevent any threat to the Member
States’ internal security’.* However, in view
of the increasing security threats witnessed
at the external borders during the past year,
it is necessary to further clarify the role of,
and tools available to border management
authorities in this area.
What useful function can be played by the
border authorities in the area of counter-ter-

52 of 68

rorism or combatting smuggling of weapons
for instance? The threat of terrorist activities and the methods of entry into the EU
have been much discussed during the past
year due to several incidents which occurred
within the EU in 2014 and early 2015. Delineating the tasks and the potential tools of
those working at the borders in helping to
combat this threat is an important discussion
which should be undertaken. Given that 2015
will also be the year in which the EU renews
and updates the EU Internal Security Strategy and the European Commission will adopt
a European Agenda on Security, this discussion would also be very appropriately timed.
Certain cross-border crimes, such as trafficking in human beings, and the role to be played
by border authorities in tackling them have
been well addressed. Other areas could also
benefit from further attention, for instance
in the fight against smuggling of firearms and
ammunition into the EU. Taking into account
the dual circumstances of larger passenger
flows at the borders and an increasing threat
of small amounts of firearms and ammunition
being smuggled by individuals, rather than
as part of dedicated and larger shipments, it
is clear that this represents an increasingly
challenging phenomena for border guards
to handle. There is a need then to address
border management’s function in thwarting these criminal ambitions and preventing
an increasing numbers of illicit firearms, its
parts and ammunition from entering the EU.
With the above issues in mind, specialised
and integrated trainings across the EU and
improved intelligence gathering and analysis
would certainly help to provide for stronger
cross-border crime prevention and detection.
A stronger emphasis could be placed on increasing risk analysis capacities at a national

© Frontex, 2013

level. This could then be employed in, for instance, developing risk profiles of potential
offenders and assessing passenger information. Improved knowledge on the security
threats faced at the borders with information
on the modalities, actions, and the modi operandi typically employed at the borders by
offenders could all prove useful additions to
the border control authorities’ cross-border
crime tackling toolkit. These measures would
all fall under the broader umbrella exercise
of better defining and designing the security
aspect of border management.

6.2. Full identification of
individuals entering the EU
As previous chapters have discussed, 2014
saw increased arrivals at the external borders
of the EU, often in large, mixed and sometimes overwhelming influxes at particular
borders. The corollary of this was the strain
placed on border control authorities which
left them with fewer resources available for
identifying those attempting to enter the
EU. This then resulted in some of the figures
seen in the past year, where high numbers
of entrants were not attributed a nationality. Pressures faced at a border can also lead
to increases in the phenomenon of nationality swapping for the purposes fraudulent
entry to the EU. Additionally it is an obligation stemming from the Schengen Borders
Code that entrants must have their nationalities identified.

why there is a strong need to ensure the correct and full identification of those arriving
at the borders so as to provide the full necessary protection, where required. Secondly,
the identification issue concerns the potential
threat to internal security. With large numbers of arrivals remaining essentially unclassified for a variety of reasons – false or lack
of identification documents, concerns over
the validity of a claimed nationality etc. –
there is clearly a risk that persons representing a security threat enter the EU. However,
the challenge for the border guard is clear:
how to differentiate for example, between
the asylum seeker who arrives at the external border with no papers and the economic
migrant or a migrant who might pose a security threat attempting to abuse the system
by claiming a false nationality? This difficulty
is clearly exacerbated in situations of intense
migratory pressure.
It is clear that in response to these challenges, greater emphasis must be placed on
increased screening and debriefing teams.
Second-line checks on arrivals are a crucial
step in the identification process. They also
provide an important source of information
which can be further used for intelligence and
risk analysis purposes. Improving intelligence
and analytical capacities are thus also of great
importance. The development of risk profiles
of arrivals and training for border guards involved in these areas would also help to ensure greater identification.

The importance of this issue is two-fold; there
is both a humanitarian and a security rationale. Firstly, granting international protection
to those in need is a legal obligation. Hence

6.3. Knowledge management
at operational and policy
levels
One improvement which has been evident
in the preceding years has been the increasing sources of information and data from
the external borders. Information is key to
situational monitoring and for analytical
purposes and so the improved availability
of information is of significant importance.
However, with greater information comes
a greater challenge in effectively utilising it.
This is especially the case in emergency situations when large amounts of information
are available but time is scarce. It is in this
context that data and situational information is sometimes not enough, but authorities will require the analysis and intelligence
derived from it to make the fully informed
decisions. The management of this knowledge process is critical.
Methods for ensuring that the available and
appropriate information reaches the authorities must be assured and must also be able to
perform even in the context of time pressure.
The cycle of information is an essential process for informed decision making: Ensuring
that reliable and stable information from the
screeners, debriefers and all those working on
the front line is efficiently extracted and then
analysed by the analytical services and transformed into workable and relevant knowledge
for onward and timely transmission to decision makers is crucial. This process supposes
the existence of capable analytical services
and timely data collection. Also important in
this regard is an exchange and sharing ‘culture’, where relevant information is transmitted amongst differing national and EU services.
Another aspect of this issue can be seen at
a higher policy level. It is still unclear how to
transfer sufficient and relevant information
and knowledge from border management
into the articulation of informed and coherent

54 of 68

migration policies. The knowledge gained by
border management officials, from the bottom up, should help feed into the devising of
the higher level strategic policies taken at national and EU level. The analysis and intelligence should be a constant and reliable source
when deciding on the future approaches in
the area of migration management.

6.4. Specific third-country
border management and
border security risks
Building relations with countries outside the
EU represents a very important method for
effectively tackling irregular migration and
cross-border crime and forms an important
part of the EU’s Integrated Border Management (IBM) concept. Operational cooperation, regional capacity building projects and
information exchange have all been of huge
importance in ensuring efficient and effective border control systems for both the EU
Member States and their counterparts. However, in these relations there has, at times,
been a tendency to address the risks that the
third countries’ border management circumstances represent to the EU borders. For instance, the focus might be overly placed on
the third countries’ weak capacities, porous
borders and population movements. It is a legitimate concern but it also can lead to a lack
of incentive for third countries to cooperate if
the approach is too EU-centric. The approach
could be more focused on directly benefitting
the specific border related needs of those third
countries. The consequence of this would be
to assist in improving and enhancing their
border management in relation to the threats
and needs of these third countries.
Identifying the risks faced by third-country
partners in terms of their border management and border security concerns, and then
recommending local and regional actions for
risk mitigation would then likely cascade and
spread out to create reciprocal positive ben-

efits for the EU borders. It would also help to
ensure increased incentive for cooperation
with the EU. This could be achieved through
targeted capability building and technical assistance projects in third countries, based on a
national appreciation of risk, which would aim
to strengthen third-country migration management capacities, whilst, all the while, still
imparting EU border management standards.
As an initial proposal, Turkey would appear
to be a reasonable candidate with whom to
implement this working method of increased
and targeted cooperation. This does not preclude the necessity to cooperate with other
countries of origin and transit who play important roles and are crucial partners in the
EU neighbourhood.

6.5. Multidisciplinary
integrated training for EU
border-control authorities
It has been seen in this year’s Annual Risk
Analysis that the geopolitical environment
surrounding the EU is becoming ever more
complex. Given the proximity of conflict areas to the external borders of the EU, there
is no doubt that the threat level to EU border security increases. With the situations
in certain neighbouring countries constantly
evolving, sometimes for the worse, so too the
nature of the challenge for border authorities proves to be constantly shifting. This can
be seen also in the sudden influxes faced at
the external borders which have proved difficult to predict and thus, demand an effective and timely response. It can be a challenge
to provide for the continuous functioning of
border-control activities in a situation where
thousands of migrants, of mixed backgrounds,
circumstances and nationalities, arrive at the
border in a very short space of time. It implies a certain level of inherent risk and vulnerability at the external borders.
In response to constantly evolving location
and scale of the threats witnessed, the au-

thorities at the borders must have a capability for risk mitigation during moments
of emergency. Often the response in such
situations calls for intensified interagency
cooperation. This is an important tool for
responding when a particular border is under an inordinate strain. The difficulty that
this method presents though is that the officials tasked with working in closer collaboration, whether they are from customs,
security services, asylum authorities, or indeed border guards, are not trained to know
the work of the other. The border guard will
likely not have the necessary knowledge of
the customs official’s functions and likewise,
the police officer will not know all the procedures of the asylum official’s work – and
vice versa. This can lead to misunderstandings, difficulties and delays when these authorities are required to assist one another
during crises. When time is of the essence,
and a potential humanitarian crisis is unfolding, processes must be as streamlined and as
dependable as possible.
A potential mitigation for this issue could
be to complement interagency cooperation
through an integrated multidisciplinary training. An integrated training for all officials
working at the borders would aim to provide
them with the skills found in one another’s
respective disciplines. This could comprise
of specialised courses to enable those undertaking them to gain a knowledge of the
processes behind the work of their counterparts in the field. Ensuring that a border guard
would be well versed in the work of a lawenforcement security officer, and have a secure grasp of the issues going into the fight
against smuggling of weapons, for instance,
would ensure that in his own work he could
contribute to the work of the other. A better
understanding of the needs of the other authorities in the field would certainly lead to
an enhanced interagency cooperation which
could help to mitigate the threat arising during emergencies at the borders.

Notes on FRAN data sources and methods
The term Member States refers to FRAN
Member States, which includes the 28 Member States and the three Schengen Associated Countries (Iceland, Norway and
Switzerland). For the data concerning detections at the external borders of the EU,
some of the border types are not applicable
to all FRAN Member States. This pertains to
data on all FRAN indicators since the data
are provided disaggregated by border type.
The definitions of detections at land borders are therefore not applicable (excluding
borders with non-Schengen principalities)
for Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark,
France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK. For
Cyprus, the land border refers to the Green
Line demarcation with the area where the
Government of the Republic of Cyprus does
not exercise effective control. For sea borders, the definitions are not applicable for
land-locked Member States including Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Luxembourg, Slovakia and Switzerland.
In addition, data on detections of illegal border-crossing at land, air and sea BCPs (1B) are
not available for Iceland, Ireland and Spain,
and in Greece these detections are included
in the data for indicator 1A. Data for Norway only include detections of illegal border-crossing at land and sea BCPs (1B), not
between BCPs (1A).
Data on detections of illegal border-crossing between sea BCPs (1A) are not available for Ireland.
Data on apprehension (FRAN Indicator 2) of
facilitators are not available for Ireland. For
Italy, the data are not disaggregated by border type, but are reported as total appre-

hensions (not specified). Data for Italy and
Norway also include the facilitation of illegal stay and work. For Romania, the data include land Intra-EU detections on exit at the
border with Hungary.
For the data concerning detections of illegal stay (FRAN Indicator 3), data on detections on exit are not available for Denmark,
Ireland, Italy, Spain and the UK. For Greece,
only detections of illegal stayers with false
documents are reported at the air border as
detections of illegal stay on exit. Data on detections of illegal stay inland have not been
available from the Netherlands since 2012.
Data on refusals of entry (FRAN Indicator 4)
at the external EU borders are not disaggregated by reason of refusal for Ireland and
the UK. Refusals of entry at the Spanish land
borders at Ceuta and Melilla (without the issuance of a refusal form) are reported separately and are not included in the presented
FRAN data.
The data on passenger flow (shared on voluntary basis) are not available for Austria,
Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Malta, Portugal, Sweden and the
UK. Data on passenger flow at the air border are not available according to the definition for Spain. Data at the sea border are
not available for Spain, the Netherlands, Romania and Denmark.
For Ireland, data on persons using false documents are only available from February 2011
(FRAN Indicator 6). In Sweden, the data on
false document use are not presented since
the reported detections do not distinguish between apprehensions of persons using false
documents at the external border and those
apprehended inland.
