Frontex official publications fall into four main categories: risk analysis, training,
operations and research, each marked with a distinct graphic identifier. Risk analysis
publications bear a triangular symbol formed by an arrow drawing a triangle, with
a dot at the centre. Metaphorically, the arrow represents the cyclical nature of risk
analysis processes and its orientation towards an appropriate operational response.
The triangle is a symbol of ideal proportions and knowledge, reflecting the pursuit
of factual exactness, truth and exhaustive analysis. The dot at the centre represents
the intelligence factor and the focal point where information from diverse sources
converges to be processed, systematised and shared as analytical products. Thus,
Frontex risk analysis is meant to be at the centre and to form a reliable basis for its
operational activities.

Introduction

Concept
The Western Balkans Risk Analysis Network (WB-RAN) performs monthly exchanges of statistical data and information
on the most recent irregular migration developments affecting the region. This information is compiled by the Frontex Risk
Analysis Unit (RAU) and analysed in cooperation with the regional partners on
a quarterly and annual basis. The annual
reports offer a more in-depth analysis of
the occurring developments and phenomena which impact the regional and common borders, while the quarterly reports
are meant to provide regular updates and
identify emerging trends in order to maintain situational awareness. Both types of
reports are aimed at offering support for
strategic and operational decision-making.

Methodology
The Western Balkans Quarterly is focused
on quarterly developments as reflected by
the seven key indicators of irregular migration: (1) detections of illegal bordercrossing between BCPs, (2) detections of
illegal border-crossing at BCPs, (3) refusals of entry, (4) detections of illegal stay,
(5) asylum applications, (6) detections of
facilitators, and (7) detections of fraudulent documents.1

1

Please note that the analysis of this indicator
is now limited to WB-RAN countries
only, given that EU Member States have
transitioned to the European Union
Document-Fraud (EDF) reporting scheme.

The data presented in the overview are
derived from monthly statistics provided
within the framework of the WB-RAN
and reference period statistics from common border sections of neighbouring EU
Member States (Croatia Bulgaria, Greece,
Hungary and Romania). In addition, the
Western Balkans Quarterly is drawing
from FRAN Quarterly reports and also
data analysed in the framework of other
risk analysis networks (FRAN, EDF-RAN).

Structure
The first part offers a general Situational
overview broken down by main areas of
work of border-control authorities and police activities related to irregular migration.
The second part presents more in-depth
Featured risk analyses of particular phenomena. As the current issue of the Western
Balkans Quarterly is the second following
a new approach adopted for risk analysis quarterlies, the structure of the report
may still be subject to some readjustments.
Changes in data scope after Croatia’s
entry to the EU
Important changes in the collection and
use of data for Western Balkans Quarterly
were introduced upon Croatia’s joining the
EU in July 2013. Firstly, data for Slovenia,
which now has no external borders with
non-EU Western Balkan countries, has not
been included in the report since the third

quarter of 2013. Slovenian historical data
were also excluded from the tables in order to make the comparison with previous
quarters analytically meaningful.
Secondly, as the Croatian-Hungarian and
Croatian-Slovenian border sections have
now become internal EU-borders, they are
no longer covered by this report.
Thirdly, after joining the EU, Croatian data
on illegal stay data are limited to detections at the border. More precisely, Croatia’s illegal stay data only include cases
detected on exit, while inland detections
are not included. The analysis of the illegal stay indicator takes this fact into
consideration.
Changes in data scope after Kosovo*’s
entry to the WB-RAN
Starting from the first quarter of 2014 data
from Kosovo* on key indicators of irregular migration have been included in the
reporting making it possible to get a more
comprehensive picture on the irregular
movements in the region. However, as
there is no historical data available for Kosovo*, the new data do in some measure
impact the comparisons of the examined
period with the previous quarters. When
necessary for analytical purposes, some
comparisons can be made also excluding
data from Kosovo* and noted in the text.

of the non-regional flow, respectively.
Overall, at regional level, in the analysed
quarter detections of Syrian migrants increased significantly (+260%) compared
to the previous three months, and Syrians ranked just ahead of Afghans, whose
numbers rose by 193%.

During the analysed period, roughly 52 200
non-regional migrants (citizens of countries other than Western Balkan countries)
in transit from Turkey, Greece and Bulgaria
were detected for illegal border-crossing at
the common and regional borders (Fig. 2).
This represents a 219% increase compared
to the previous quarter. Nine out of ten illegal border-crossings in the Western Balkans were due to non-regional migrants.

The third and fourth positions were occupied by Iraqi and Pakistani migrants, both
of whom accelerated their rising trends
described in the past periods, registering
three- and fourfold increases, respectively,
compared to the previous quarter.

Syrians and Afghans were by far the two
main nationalities with 38% and 36% shares

Together, these top four nationalities accounted for over 87% of the non-regional
migration flow reported between BCPs.
Interestingly, during the period under review the number of detections involving
African migrants rose more than three
times compared to the previous quarter.
All regions of Africa contributed to this
overall increase, with Congolese, Somalis, Cameroonians and Nigerians being the
top reported nationalities.
The detections of Western Balkan regional migrants (citizens of Western Balkan countries) decreased by 83% compared
to the previous quarter, mainly in connection to the considerable decline of Kosovo*
nationals (-98%), and only accounted for
8% of the total illegal border-crossings (by
regional and non-regional migrants) reported during Q2.
The drop in the numbers of Kosovo* nationals can be regarded as a positive outcome of the concerted international action
undertaken by Kosovo*, Serbia, Hungary,
Austria and Germany, which was more extensively discussed in the WB-ARA 2015.
More precisely, during the analysed quarter 4 583 illegal border-crossings of regional migrants were detected, which
represents a sixth of the number in the
previous three-month period. However, if
compared with the same quarter of 2014
this figure is still 14% higher, mainly due
to a rise in detections of Albanian nationals, who now account for 81% of the regional flow.
A vast majority (96%) of the nationals from
Western Balkan countries detected while
attempting an illegal border-crossing were
reported at the common borders with
EU Member States, especially on entry to
Greece (75%) and Hungary (18%).

Facilitators
During the second quarter of 2015, 572
facilitators were detected, representing
an 11% increase compared to the previous three-month period. This increase can
be regarded as marginal if compared to
the 226% rise in the number of reported
illegal border-crossings by non-regional
migrants This indicates migrants’ significantly improved ability to self-organise
their trips.

As regards nationalities, 79% of all facilitators detected in the analysed quarter
were nationals of Western Balkan countries while 14% were citizens of the neighbouring EU Member States/Schengen
Associated Countries.
Serbia continued to report the highest
share of detected facilitators (47%) mainly
at its borders with Hungary and the former

Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, but also
inland. This, along with the fact that over
59% of the facilitators reported at regional
level were Serbian nationals indicates that
Serbia remains the region’s country most
affected by the non-regional flow (as the
lack of orientation in the region makes
the non-regional migrants more likely to
need facilitation).

Border checks
Clandestine entries
In Q2 2015, a total of 2 216 non-regional
migrants were detected while attempting to illegally cross the border hidden in
vehicles (a sixfold rise compared to the
previous quarter and the highest number
since data collection began). Such a high
increase was mainly due to the surge in
detections at the border between Serbia
and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. This section accounted for 88%
of the non-regional migrants detected at
BCPs during Q2. In terms of nationalities,

and Iraqis were the decisive top three, together accounting for 92% of detections.
Additionally only, 25 nationals of Western
Balkan countries were reported at BCPs.

tionals (47), most likely in an attempt to
avoid entry bans following the abuse of
visa liberalisation.

Document fraud
During the second quarter, there were 241
cases of false document use reported by
the six Western Balkan countries, a number similar to that of the previous quarter.

In the analysed period, the number of refusals of entry increased by 16% compared
to the previous quarter: from roughly
8 500 to 9 800. Compared to the corresponding quarter of 2014, the numbers remained relatively stable.

Serbia continued to rank first, with 45% of all
regional detections, followed by Albania and
the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, with 20% and 14% shares, respectively.

As usual, a large majority of refusals of entry were issued at the land borders (92%)
while the remaining 8% were mostly reported at the air borders.

As regards nationalities, during the second
quarter Albanians continued to rank first
amongst false document users, followed
by Serbian and Kosovo* citizens.

Most of the refusals reported by the neighbouring EU Member States were issued
to nationals of Western Balkan counties
(93%) while just under a half of the persons refused in the six regional countries
were local residents, followed by EU nationals (mostly travellers unaware of the
entry conditions required by Western Balkan countries), who accounted for 27%.

2 000

The most commonly used false documents
were passports, border stamps and ID
cards. As in previous quarters the large
majority of the detected ID cards (41 out of
50) were EU Member States’ documents,
as they can be used to move freely inside
the Schengen area and the EU.

Refusals of entry

The overall number of refusals issued to
migrants of those non-regional nationalities that typically enter the EU through
Turkey/Greece still represented a very low
share of the total. This indicates that the
non-regional migrants transiting the Western Balkans tend to target the green borders without even attempting legal entry.

Situation in the Western Balkans

Illegal stay within the Western
Balkan countries
There were 888 detections of illegal stay
reported by the six Western Balkan countries during the analysed period, which
represents a second consecutive quarterly decrease of this indicator. The number is significantly lower in relation to the
previous quarter (-31%) and even more so
when compared to the corresponding period of 2014 (-41%).

nians outpaced Syrians and ranked first
and second, respectively, among detected
illegal stayers. Serbians continued to be
mainly reported by Bosnia and Herzegovina while Albanians seemed to prefer to
stay illegally in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Serbia in almost
equal shares. Syrian illegal stayers ranked
third in terms of detections during the
second quarter and continued to be almost exclusively reported by Albania inside its territory.

Looking at the top three nationalities in
the analysed quarter, Serbians and Alba-

All the top three nationalities registered
decreases compared to the previous quar-

ter, ranging from -19% in the case of Albanians to -56% for Syrians.
Interestingly, very low numbers of people of non-regional nationalities associated with the migratory flow originating
from Turkey/Greece were detected while
illegally staying inside the six Western
Balkan countries. For example, although
Syrians and Afghans were the top two
nationalities for detected illegal bordercrossing during this quarter, only 111 and
21 of these nationals, respectively, were
reported for illegal stay in the six Western Balkan countries.

Large and sustained transit
through the Western Balkans
of migrants originally entering
the EU via Turkey
The number of detected illegal bordercrossings by the non-regional transiting
flow throughout the analysed period was
unprecedented, setting an absolute record
since data collection began for the Western Balkans. More precisely, the 54 437
detected illegal border-crossings by nonregional migrants (52 221 between BCPs
and 2 216 at BCPs) was comparable to the
sum total of detections of non-regional
migrants in the past two years (54 692 in
2013 and 2014).
As presented in the WB-ARA 2015 as well
as in the previous Western Balkans Quarterly analyses there is a direct link between
the non-regional migration flow transiting the Western Balkans and the one affecting the borders of Greece, especially
in the Eastern Aegean Sea. Specifically,
the high pressure on the Aegean Islands is
later echoed on the Western Balkan route
with a certain time lag, which is basically
the time migrants need to organise their
onwards movements (Fig. 9).
Figure 9. The migration pressure
recorded in the Eastern Aegean is later
reflected in the Western Balkans

ond quarter are a direct consequence of
the unprecedented number of migrants reported in the Eastern Aegean in the same
period. More exactly, the number of illegal border-crossings reported by Greece in
the Aegean Islands in Q2 2015 is the highest since data collection began (roughly
equal to the totals for this area over the
past five years – between 2010 and 2014).
The direct link between the two regions
can be also confirmed by the composition
of migrants’ nationalities (Fig. 10).

shares of reported detections of illegal border-crossing (Fig. 11), the Bulgarian-Serbian border appears to have increased its
appeal as an entry point for non-regional
migrants to the Western Balkans in relation to the same period last year.

The same appears to be the case for the
border between the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Greece, which
accounted for 12% of all detections of nonregional migrants in the Western Balkans.
However, the latter development is not entirely new and is likely to have just become
more apparent in the data due to increased
activity of the border police and the diminished migrants’ motivation to transit the
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
undetected (see section on Countermeasures triggered by the increased migratory
pressure at regional level overleaf).
In the northern part of the region, the
Hungarian-Serbian section remained the
busiest border in terms of detected illegal
border-crossings associated with non-regional flow and the main point used to exit
the region. During the discussed quarter,
roughly 37 000 detections of non-regional

migrants were reported from this section,
which represents a new quarterly record.
At regional level almost all nationalities
manifested increases. Similar to previous
periods, Syrians and Afghans ranked first
and second, while Pakistanis and Iraqis occupied the third and fourth place, roughly
reflecting the above described trends in
the Eastern Aegean Sea.
Despite overall lower numbers, during
the analysed period an over threefold rise
could be observed in detections of African
migrants throughout the Western Balkans.
As regards the regions of origin, migrants
from Eastern, Central, West and North Africa all contributed to this overall increase.
More precisely, migrants from Central Africa ranked first both in absolute numbers (1 251) and in terms of the largest

increase (+640%), mainly due to the remarkable rises in Congolese and Cameroonians (nine- and sixfold, respectively).
West Africans ranked second in terms of
numbers (1 174) showing a 175% rise compared to the previous quarter, including
mainly Nigerians and Ghanaians (with sixand fourfold rises, respectively). The third
place, with a total of 1 024 detections and
a 75% increase, was taken by East African migrants, mainly Somalis and Eritreans (with +47% and threefold increases,
respectively). Finally, North African nationals ranked fourth, with a total of 622
detections representing a 465% increase,
mainly due to increased numbers of Algerians, Sudanese and Moroccans.
The increase in detected Africans in the
Western Balkans could be partly explained
by the expansion of Turkish Airlines connection network in Africa (see box).

Turkish Airlines has the largest network in Africa
Turkish Airlines has nearly doubled its seat capacity to Africa from about
38 000 in 2011 to about 70 000 weekly seats at the end of 2014. The carrier is
planning further expansion in Africa in 2015 with at least six new destinations.
It already boasts the largest network in the continent among foreign carriers, overtaking Air France and Emirates. By the end of 2015, Turkish Airlines
will have at least 45 destinations in its African network across 30 countries.
For comparison, Air France, which has the second largest African network
among European carriers, offers flights to 34 destinations. Brussels Airlines
has 19 African destinations on offer, British Airways 18 and Lufthansa 13.

Countermeasures triggered
by the increased migratory
pressure at regional level
The increased pressure exerted by the
transiting migration flow, the humanitarian dimension of migration and different vulnerabilities appear to be the factors
which have shaped a response of the affected countries.
Hungary, pressed by the ever rising number of detections decided to implement a
series of measures in order to curb the migratory flow through its territory. These
measures began with putting up banners on the streets of Budapest displaying messages aimed at deterring irregular
migration, continued with requesting the
population’s opinion on the phenomenon
(through a national survey), before hardening the migration policy and erecting
a physical obstacle along the country’s
southern border.
According to the media, the restrictions of
the asylum policy include the creation of a
list of safe countries which, if transited by
migrants before reaching Hungary, would
expose them to a rapid asylum procedure
and an immediate return based on readmission agreements. Similarly, migrants
already in the asylum procedure will see
their claims rejected if they leave accommodation centres for more than 48 hours
without approval. These changes entered
into force on 1 August 2015.
The physical obstacle (planned finalisation
on 31 August) will consist of a temporary
fence running along the entire length of
the southern border with Serbia.
If implemented as planned, these changes
will likely result in accelerated returns of
migrants to Serbia based on the bilateral
agreement and a lower number of illegal
border-crossings at the Hungarian-Serbian border.

18 of 31

However, the impact of these measures
will ultimately depend on their effective
implementation.
Serbia, reacting to the increase in the migratory pressure increased its control activities on the common border with the
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and decided to establish another reception centre in Presevo (with support
also from Russia via the Russian-Serbian
Humanitarian Centre – RSHC). Hungary,
Austria and Germany are supporting the
increased control measures with personnel and equipment.
The increased police activities by Serbia at
the common border with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia appears to
have a certain deterrence effect on migrants. Namely, the Serbian authorities
reported approximately 43 000 people
who have renounced their intention to
cross the green border between June and
July after seeing police patrols. Nevertheless, many migrants continue to make it
across, as the number of expressed intentions for asylum inside Serbia between
June and July totalled almost 40 000 according to police statistics.
Out of these 40 000 migrants, only 136 actually submitted official asylum applications
(one in every 294), while the rest preferred
to avoid registration. The ratio between the
expressed intentions and the official applications for asylum appears to have seriously
deteriorated compared to 2014 (when one
in every 43 actually filed an official claim).
This is a further indication that non-regional
migrants use asylum systems a means to
avoid detention on transit.
Kosovo*, being aware of the increasing migratory pressure and the enhanced con-

trol activities of Serbia, also reportedly
decided to increase the surveillance capabilities on their common border with the
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
in order to pre-empt a possible flow deflection across their territory. Additional
personnel and equipment from other territorial border police units have been redeployed to this border section.
On 18 June the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia modified the migration
legislation in order to provide detected migrants who express the intention to claim
asylum with documents allowing them 72
hours to move across the territory and
reach one of the reception centres.
This decision appears to have been taken
in the attempt to reduce the impact of
migration on the lives and security of the
migrants. Namely, many non-regional migrants tried to avoid police detection and
thus exposed themselves to either dangerous routes (as was presented in our previous report many died struck by trains while
walking along train tracks) or to kidnappings, extortions and violence by various
criminal groups.
While mitigating the risk to the wellbeing of migrants by giving them no reason
to choose dangerous roads or interact
with criminal groups, this new legislation
appears to have also had an impact on
the border security as it was used by migrants for transiting the country rather
than reaching reception centres.
Namely, it appears to have accelerated
migrants’ movements across the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (as after
the first registration they can use public
transport) and increased the pressure on
the common border with Serbia and then

on Hungary’s border with Serbia during
July and August.
In addition, this decision has also encouraged more migrants to choose the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as the first
entry point in the Western Balkans, creating a very high pressure on the country’s
south border with Greece (between late
June and August).
Trying to cope with this increased pressure, on 20 August the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia declared a state of
emergency and deployed additional miliary
and police personnel to the southern border with Greece, in order to prevent illegal
border-crossing between BCPs.
However, this decision appears to have
been reversed on 22 August following very
high pressure and clashes between security forces and migrants who were trying to break through the barriers. At the

time of writing this report it was not yet
clear if the decision to reopen the border
was permanent or temporary. The security forces maintain presence, but just to
register the migrants, check their belongings and ensure that they pass through in
an orderly fashion so that the flow runs
smoothly without creating blockages at
bus and train stations after entry. This
will keep the flow going smoothly, but
will likely increase the pressure further
along the route.
If similar measures to seal the border will
be reintroduced in the future, they are
likely to create a high pressure in the short
term and increase security risks at the
common border section with Greece. In
longer term, such measures can reduce
the attractiveness of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia for the transiting migrants and probably deflect them
to other common sections.

Red Cross in Gevgelija explaining

Republic of Macedonia
At the regional level, other countermeasures are likely to be implemented
in response to the increased migratory
pressure.
However, if these measures are taken in
isolation, they are more likely to result in
the rerouting of migration flows rather
than actually stopping them.

II. Featured risk analyses

Factors contributing to the increase
in detections of Afghans in the Eastern
Aegean Sea and the Western Balkans
Afghan migrants were increasingly reported for illegal border-crossing on the
Eastern Aegean Islands during the first six
months of 2015. With a total of over 19 000
detections, these nationals accounted for
29% of the overall flow affecting this area.
Syrians still ranked first in detections in the
Eastern Aegean (over two times the number of Afghans) but considering the nationality swapping practice the real number
of Afghans could be higher than statistical data indicate.

(this would mean that 700 000 of the refugee-card holders would not have their
cards renewed by 2015 and would be expected to return).

As a consequence of the increased detections of Afghans in the Eastern Aegean,
their numbers have also risen on the Western Balkan route, where they were the second most detected nationality throughout
the first half of the year, very close behind
Syrians. Specifically, during the first six
months of 2015 there were over 25 000
reported illegal border-crossings by Afghans at the common and regional borders of Western Balkan countries.

Also apparently in line with this policy,
media reports between June and December 2014 indicated a reduction by approximately 260 000 of the temporary visas
offered to Afghans residing in Iran and not
registered as refugees.

This rising trend may be additionally explained by the deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan after the retreat of
the ISAF and the following developments
in Iran, Pakistan and Turkey (countries assessed to be hosting over 5.5 million Afghans between them).

Afghans living in Iran
Push factors
In 2012, the Iranian Bureau of Aliens and
Foreign Immigrants’ Affairs announced
that they planned to return 1.6 million unlawful persons and a total of 900 000 refugees to their countries of origin by 2015. It
was expected that by 2015, 200 000 refugees would voluntarily return and that
700 000 would no longer be refugees

20 of 31

In June 2014 media reports emphasised increased pressures by the Iranian authorities to accelerate returns of Afghans. Some
reports indicated that in this attempt the
authorities were stretching the tripartite
Iran-Afghanistan-UNHCR agreement on
voluntary return of Afghans from Iran.

More exactly, in June 2014 Iran renewed
temporary visas to 760 000 unregistered
Afghans for a period of six months (until December 2014). In December 2014, according
to Human Rights Watch (HRW), the Iranian
authorities again renewed temporary visas, but this time only to 500 000 Afghans,
leaving a difference of roughly a quartermillion without a legal status. Moreover,
the 500 000 temporary visas which were
extended in December were also bound to
expire in June 2015 and have currently been
extended to the end of November.
Rough estimates of the Afghan
presence and status in Iran
The Iranian Ministry of Interior estimated
a total of around 3 million Afghans to be
present on their territory.
By combining different sources of information this total number can be roughly divided into three categories depending on
the status enjoyed by the persons in Iran.

UNHCR estimates around 950 000 to be
registered as refugees, while IOM estimates between 1 and 1.4 million to be undocumented. Moreover, media reports and
HRW data indicate a shrinking third category of people with documents but not
registered as refugees (i.e. holders of temporary visas who decreased from roughly
760 000 to 500 000 as mentioned above).

Afghans living in Pakistan
Push factors
According to an IOM report, between January and May 2015 a total number of over
73 000 Afghans returned from Pakistan
to Afghanistan. Out of these, only around
6 600 were reported as ‘deportees’ enforced by the authorities, while the rest or
roughly 67 000 were reported as ‘spontaneous returnees’. The spontaneous returns
are legal, under a tripartite agreement between Pakistan, Afghanistan and UNHCR
signed in 2007 and apparently still in force,
which allows voluntary repatriation of Afghans and sets an obligation for Afghanistan to accept and integrate them.
However, unconfirmed reports by HRW
suggest that the increase in voluntary returns may be more related to Pakistani authorities actually bending the agreement
and de facto pushing Afghans to leave as
a response to the recent escalation of Taliban terrorist activities.
Pakistan, with the help of UNHCR, was
providing Afghans living on their territory
with documents called Proof of Registration (PoR), which made their stay legal and
allowed them access to certain support.
Starting from 2008 (with an 8-month reinstatement in 2010) new PoR are no longer
issued. The authorities only extend the va-

wb-ran · q2 2015

lidity of the old ones (currently until the
end of 2015), a decision likely to limit the
access to basic support for many Afghans
(new arrivals and also those currently not
registered) . The fact that UNHCR can currently process roughly 7 000 people per
year and issue refugee documents recognised by the Government can act as a
mitigation factor but with limited effect
(considering that the number of undocumented persons is estimated at between
1 and 4 million).

territory exposes a very high (estimates
vary between 1 and over 4 million currently) and possibly increasing (if PoR are
not extended beyond 2015) number of Afghans to forced expulsion.
Rough estimates of the Afghan
presence and status in Pakistan
According to information presented by different sources Pakistan currently hosts a
minimum of roughly 2.5 million Afghans.
Out of this total around 1.5 million are
registered in possession of Proof of Registration (currently valid until the end of
2015) while another 1 million are currently
unregistered.

It can be assessed that no new PoR, a possible non-extension of previously issued
documents beyond 2015, coupled with
the right of Pakistani authorities to deport undocumented migrants from their

Afghans living in Turkey

Push factors

Figure 13.Proof of Registration used by
Afghans in Pakistan

Reporting indicates that the time needed
for processing the asylum claims in Turkey is very long with appointments for
processing being made over one year in
advance and in different districts of the
country. Because of this situation many
Afghans become frustrated and around
14 000 are currently seeking resettlement
in a third country. Additionally, there are

no camps for non-Syrian refugees in Turkey and most of the Afghans reside in urban areas.
Estimates of the Afghan presence
and status in Turkey
Currently there are 40 000 Afghan refugees and asylum seekers in Turkey and
an extra 10 000 are expected in 2015 according to UNHCR.

Conclusion
All of the above can partially explain the
increase in detections of Afghans seen
at the external borders (mainly Eastern
Mediterranean and, as a consequence, the
Western Balkans).
It should also be considered that any further increase of deportation by both Pakistani and Iranian authorities will further
fuel the flow of Afghans targeting the external EU border.
