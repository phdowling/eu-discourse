Frontex official publications fall into four main categories: risk analysis, training, operations
and research, each marked with a distinct graphic identifier. Risk analysis publications
bear a triangular symbol formed by an arrow drawing a triangle, with a dot at the centre.
Metaphorically, the arrow represents the cyclical nature of risk analysis processes and its
orientation towards an appropriate operational response. The triangle is a symbol of ideal
proportions and knowledge, reflecting the pursuit of factual exactness, truth and exhaustive
analysis. The dot at the centre represents the intelligence factor and the focal point where
information from diverse sources converges to be processed, systematised and shared as
analytical products. Thus, Frontex risk analysis is meant to be at the centre and to form
a reliable basis for its operational activities.

Executive summary
The third quarter of 2014 saw an increase in
most of the indicators of irregular migration
exchanged under the Frontex Risk Analysis
Network (FRAN) in comparison with the second quarter of 2014. The only decrease was
observed in the number of effective returns.
A factor in this general trend was the annually recurring cycle of seasonal variation,
whereby the summer months of each year
are usually marked by increased pressure at
the external borders.
However, the increase in irregular migration
was above what would usually be expected
based on seasonal fluctuations at this time of
the year. In the third quarter of 2014, the number of illegal border-crossings reported by the
Member States was at its highest level since
FRAN data collection began in 2007 at over
110 000. In fact, compared to the third quarter of 2013, detections at the external borders
increased by more than 150%.
Almost 90% of the irregular migrants were
reported from the sea border of the EU. Compared to one year ago, both Italy and Greece
reported a more than threefold increase in
detections of illegal border-crossing. Also detections in Spain increased; however, only by
6% and from a significantly lower base.
In Q3 2014, Syrian migrants were the most
reported nationality in the Central Mediterranean with more 20 000 detections, which
accounted for one quarter of all detections
at this border section, while the number of
Eritrean migrants, previously top-ranking,
decreased by 20% from Q2 (falling to about
13 000). Due to the difficult living conditions
for migrants in Egypt, many of the 140 000
Syrians currently registered in the country decided to leave for Europe, mainly through Libya.

The intensified migration in the Central Mediterranean Sea was not only related to improved weather conditions, but also to the
migratory pressure exerted by a large number of migrants from African, Middle East, and
Asian countries, waiting in the coastal areas
of Libya for an opportunity to reach Europe.
On the other hand, criminal facilitation networks exploited the presence of Italian vessels deployed in the proximity of the Libyan
coast under the Operation Mare Nostrum,
often using unseaworthy and overcrowded
boats and counting on the prompt engagement of Italian search and rescue capacities.
For the third quarter in a row, Italy reported a
large number of sub-Saharan Africans of unidentified nationality. Before the first quarter
of 2014 hardly any migrant had been reported
in this category, yet Q3 saw over 12 000 such
detections, which may indicate that the large
waves of arrivals of sub-Saharan Africans may
have intermittently exceeded the screening
capacities deployed to the Italian sea border.
Numbers of identified sub-Saharan Africans
indeed show a significant increase in Nigerian and Gambian irregular migrants.
As the prolongation of the conflict in Syria and
the emergence of new conflict areas, such as
Iraq, might further increase war-related migration to countries of the Middle East region, also the Eastern Mediterranean route
will continuously be affected by migrants
trying to reach the EU. Already in Q3 2014,
mainly due to more detections in the eastern Aegean Sea, the share of detections reported from the Eastern Mediterranean route
has increased by 170% compared to Q3 2013.
By the end of 2013, increased operational
measures had led to a decline in detections

at the Greek and Bulgarian external land
borders and to a displacement of irregular
migration to the Aegean Sea. However, irregular migration at the green border to Turkey has been continuously on the rise again
since January 2014. Compared to the previous quarter, detections between land BCPs
increased by almost 70%, while clandestine
entries almost doubled, even though from
a far lower level.

* This designation is
without prejudice to
positions on status, and is
in line with UNSCR 1244
and the ICJ Opinion on
the Kosovo declaration of
independence.

Hungary reported a rapid threefold increase
in detections of illegal border-crossing since
the previous quarter, again representing the
largest share of irregular migration flow at
the land borders. Both detections related to
Kosovo* citizens and Syrians increased more
than fourfold. Syrians are currently the topranking nationality at this border section. This
suggests that, despite increased operational
activities at the EU’s external border with Turkey, secondary movements from Greece
through the Western Balkan region to Hungary and further on to other Member States
continue at sustained levels. Numbers of Afghan nationals, who ranked third, increased
to a lesser extent.
On the Western Mediterranean route, the
numbers of detections of illegal migration
from Morocco have almost doubled since the
previous quarter. Migration in this region has
usually peaked during the third quarter, but in
2014, the months between July and September were marked by the most intensive migratory flow since 2011.
The growth in illegal migration, however, was
limited to the blue border. Additional technical
and operational measures at the land border
to the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla
reduced attempts to climb the fence significantly and resulted in just 325 detected migrants in Q3 2014.
After the number of asylum seekers had
crossed 100 000 applications made in the

6 of 62

EU/Schengen Associated Countries in the
second quarter, the indicator broke another
record in Q3 2014 and jumped to 164 000
asylum claims. Of migration-related indicators, the number of asylum applications
showed the most consistent long-term upward trend. In absolute numbers according
to Eurostat data, Germany was the Member
State which registered the largest increase in
asylum applications compared to the same
period of last year.
Asylum seekers increasingly focused on the top
destination countries. Since 2010, the share of
applications for international protection submitted in the current top three asylum destinations (Germany, Sweden, and Italy) has
grown from 37% to around 60% of the total number. In general, Syrian asylum seekers
continued to be the number one nationality
seeking international protection in the EU/
Schengen Area, representing a fourth of all
asylum applications submitted in Q3 2014.
Since the previous quarter, the number of persons using fraudulent documents reported
through the European Union DocumentFraud Risk Analysis Network have increased
to more than 2 400 detections on entry to
the EU/Schengen area from third countries.
Spain, Italy, and France reported the highest
levels of document fraud detections of entry
at the external border, together accounting
for more than 50% of the cases. But also Poland reported more detections, which were,
to a large extent, related to Ukrainians presenting fraudulently obtained visas.
Moreover, the number of document fraud
cases detected between Schengen and nonSchengen EU countries has grown by almost
40% since the previous quarter, reaching the
highest level of both this and last year. This
surge was mostly due to more detections
of Albanian, Ukrainian, Iranian, and Syrian
document fraudsters attempting to travel
to the UK.

1. Introduction
FRAN Quarterly reports are prepared by the
Frontex Risk Analysis Unit and provide a regular overview of irregular migration at the
EU external borders, based on the irregularmigration data exchanged among Member
State border-control authorities within the
cooperative framework of the Frontex Risk
Analysis Network (FRAN) and its subsidiary,
the European Union Document-Fraud Risk
Analysis Network (EDF-RAN).
The main purpose of the FRAN Quarterlies
is to provide:
1.	feedback to the FRAN community in the
context of information exchange;
2.	a periodic update to the situational picture of irregular migration at EU level; and
3.	material for constructive discussion on reporting protocols and related trends and
patterns.
This report is intended to simultaneously
serve two objectives: firstly – to provide a
clear summary of the situation at the external border of the EU, and secondly – to serve
as an archive for future reference and comparative analyses. Consistent with standard
archival techniques, some information is repeated among sections to serve as context.

Harmonising complex, multi-source migration data among Frontex and Member States
is an ongoing process. Therefore, some of
the more detailed data and trends in this
report should be interpreted with caution
and, where possible, cross-referenced with
information from other sources. The statistics should be understood in the context of
the different levels of passenger flows passing through different border sections, the
activities of Member State border-control
authorities undertaken to secure different
border sections and widespread variation
in reporting and data-collection practices.
FRAN members and Member State risk analysis experts and border-control authorities are
considered the primary customers of these
reports. In addition to the discussions taking place during FRAN meetings, Member
State experts are invited and actively encouraged to examine and comment upon
the data and analyses presented here. Despite all efforts of the Frontex Risk Analysis
Unit and Member State experts involved in
data exchange and analyses, it is conceivable that minor errors will occur in these reports due to very challenging timelines and
the growing volume and complexity of the
data and other information exchanged within
the FRAN community.

2. Methodology
This, the 25th issue of the FRAN Quarterly, is a
comparative analysis of FRAN data collected
between July and September 2014 and exchanged between 31 Member State bordercontrol authorities within the framework of
the FRAN. The report presents the results of
statistical analysis of quarterly variations in
eight irregular-migration indicators and one
asylum indicator, aggregated at the level of
the event. Bi-monthly analytical reports exchanged by Member States were also used
for interpretative purposes and to provide
qualitative information, as were other available sources of information, such as Frontex
Joint Operations.

and 7B, and the definitions of these indicators are included in an annex to that report.
Data collection commenced in January 2011.

Precise definitions of Indicators 1 to 6, aimed
at harmonising the data exchanged at EU
level, were presented in the annexes of the
Q1 and Q2 reports in 2009 and so are not
repeated here.

In January 2012, the European Union Document-Fraud Risk Analysis Network
(EDF-RAN) was formed as a specialist forum to oversee the exchange and analyses
of detections of document fraud to illegally
cross the external borders and on all international flights. Data were backdated and
joined with those exchanged under a pilot
Tailored Risk Analysis released in 2011.

During the June 2010 FRAN Meeting, a proposal for a harmonised definition of the return
indicator was outlined and several questions
were presented in order to encourage discussion among FRAN members in view of establishing the regular collection of monthly
return data by Frontex. Subsequently, an online survey of FRAN members was conducted
to gather information and further stimulate
discussion to fine-tune the proposal for the
indicator. The 11th FRAN report (Q1 2011) was
the first to include analysis of Indicators 7A

Monthly data on the following indicators were exchanged
among the FRAN community:
1A detections of illegal border-crossing between BCPs
1B detections of illegal border-crossing at BCPs
2 detections of suspected facilitators
3 detections of illegal stay
4 refusals of entry
5 asylum applications
6 document fraud (EDF-RAN)
7A return decisions for illegally staying third-country nationals
7B	effective returns of illegally staying third-country nationals
FRAN and EDF-RAN data used in the tables are as of 18 November 2014

The FRAN data-exchange has been in place
since September 2007. In principle, data submitted after the deadline of 25 October 2014
will be reflected in the next FRAN Quarterly,
except in cases where clarification is needed in
order to proceed with comprehensive analysis.
Following the closure of the CIREFI working
group in April 2010, most of its mandates and,
of particular relevance, the exchange of data
were transferred to the FRAN.

At the beginning of 2014, Member States
started to regularly collect quantitative information on indicators related to secondary
movements. Migratory movements described
under this section include irregular migration routes between both EU Member States
(Schengen Members or not) and the Schengen Associated Countries (SACs). Migratory
routes between EU countries via the Western Balkans are also examined. For practical
reasons, the term ‘secondary routes’ or ‘secondary migration’ includes travel between all
the above mentioned categories.
In the analysis of secondary migration, emphasis is on third-country nationals who
either:
1.	Have crossed the border to the EU/SACs
illegally in one Member State and then
continue their journey within the EU to
other Member States;
2.	Have entered the EU/SACs legally but no
longer fulfil the conditions of stay or residence in the EU/SACs;

3.	Have applied or intend to apply for asylum in the EU/SACs as a modus operandi to
stay and travel illegally in the EU.
As the emphasis of this analysis is on routes, it
concentrates on those irregular migrants who
moved within the EU/SACs rather than those
who stayed at a certain place for a longer
period. Accordingly, Group 2 does not actually relate to all overstayers but only those
who attempted to travel or actually travelled further into the Schengen area once
no longer fulfilling the conditions for stay or
residence there.
External borders refer to the borders between Member States and third countries.
The borders between the Schengen Associated Countries (Liechtenstein, Norway, Iceland, and Switzerland) and third countries
are also considered as external borders. The
borders between the Schengen Associated
Countries and Schengen Member States are
considered as internal borders. For the indicators on detections of facilitators, illegal
stay and asylum, statistics are also reported
for detections at the land borders between
Schengen Member States and Schengen candidates (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, and Romania) or non-Schengen Member States (the UK
and Ireland), so that a total for EU Member
States and Schengen Associated Countries as
a whole can be presented. It was not possible to make this distinction for air and sea
borders because Member States do not habitually differentiate between extra-EU and
intra-EU air and sea connections but tend to
aggregate data for all arrivals.
When data are examined at the level of
third-country nationalities, a large percentage usually falls under categories ‘Other (not
specified)’ or ‘Unknown’. It is expected that
the percentage reported under these categories will decrease with time as Member
States improve the quality and speed of their
identification, data collection, and reporting
practices; nationalities are often reported as
‘Unknown’ if an individual’s nationality cannot
be established before reports are submitted.

This issue of the FRAN Quarterly also includes the main findings of Frontex-coordinated Joint Operations active for at least
a proportion of Q3 2014. Air borders saw
the continuation of the JO Focal Points Air
2014 as well as the start of the JO Alexis 2.
Sea borders saw the continuation of the JO
Poseidon Sea, JO Hermes, JO Aeneas and JO
Indalo, and JO Focal Points Sea. Also during the reporting period the JO Hera began,
while JO Minerva 2014 activities actually
both started and finished within the given
reporting period. The JO Aeneas came to an
end at the end of the reporting period. Land
borders saw the continuation of the JO Poseidon Land 2014, JO Focal Points Land 2014,
JO Flexible Operational Activities 2014, and
JO Attica 2014.
Both primary data sources, such as interviews
with irregular migrants, and secondary data
sources, such as reports of intelligence analysts, daily reports of deployed officers and
analytical products (weekly and bi-weekly
analytical reports for each abovementioned
operation) were used to provide an exhaustive overview of the situation at the external
borders of the EU. Additionally, open-source
data were researched as background information for the present analysis.

Acknowledgements
The Frontex Risk Analysis Unit would like
to express its gratitude to all FRAN and
EDF-RAN members and their associates in
Member State statistical, migration and document-fraud units who collect, aggregate
and exchange monthly data, also to the analysts who compile the bi-monthly analytical reports, on which much of the detailed
analyses presented here are based.
We are also grateful to Member State representatives who attended a guest analyst
workshop on intra-Schengen/EU secondary
migration in November 2014 and responded
to requests for additional information on key
topics and emerging trends.

4.1.	Detections of illegal
border-crossing

the total, while 27% of all migrants reported
from this border were Syrian nationals.

As reflected in FRAN data, the third quarter
of 2014 saw a further substantial increase in
detections of illegal border-crossing at the
EU external borders compared to Q2 2014.
Member States reported 110 581 irregular
migrants, which is the highest number ever
reported through the FRAN data collection,
and a 61% increase compared to the previous quarter. Furthermore, compared to the
third quarter of 2013 the number of detections grew by around 150%.

The record number of Syrian migrants detected at the EU external borders in Q2 doubled in Q3 2014 and exceeded 37 000. Both
the Central and the Eastern Mediterranean
route saw the highest number of detections
of Syrian nationals since the beginning of the
armed conflict in their home country. However, while in 2013 a clear majority of Syrian
migrants escaping the war attempted to
reach the EU through Greece and Bulgaria,
in 2014 they increasingly chose the Central
Mediterranean route across the Italian sea
borders.

The sea borders of the EU, where almost
100 000 irregular migrants were reported
by Member States (i.e. three times as many
as one year ago) accounted for almost 90%
of the detections of illegal border-crossing.
Detections reported from the Italian blue
border represented more than two thirds of

Figure 3 illustrates the level of detections of
illegal border-crossing during Q3 2013 and Q3
2014 (size of circles) and the degree of change
between these reporting periods (slopes)
for the top ten Member States. In Q3 2014,
most of the Member States subject to illegal
border-crossings reported increased detections compared to the same period in 2013.
The biggest relative increase was reported
by Greece, where detections rose by 260%,
while the largest increase in absolute numbers was reported from Italy. In contrast, operational measures at the Bulgarian border to
Turkey resulted in detections falling by 50%.
Apart from analysing the changes in terms
of Member State distributions, it is also informative to consider these trends by the nationality of the detected migrants at the EU
level. Figure 4 illustrates the number of detections of illegal border-crossing by the top
ten nationalities during the third quarters of
2013 and 2014 (size of circles) and the degree
of change between these reporting periods (slopes). The chart shows that in relative
terms, detections of Bangladeshi nationals

increased the most (around ninefold), while
in absolute numbers, the increase in detections of Syrian migrants was the most pronounced (+25 000).

4.2. Routes
For more detailed analyses, detections of illegal border-crossing are frequently classified
into major irregular migration routes which
more accurately relate to regions of detection rather than linear routes taken. As illustrated in Figure 5, during the third quarter of
2014 detections of illegal border-crossing in
the Central Mediterranean ranked first among
the main irregular migration routes, following
a threefold increase compared to Q3 2013. In
the Eastern Mediterranean the number of detections increased by 175% compared to the
same period in 2013. For most sea borders, the
upward trend registered in Q3 2014 exceeded
the growth, which was usually reported during the summer.
4.2.1. Central Mediterranean route
In total, 75 267 migrants have been detected on the Central Mediterranean route
in Q3 2014 (including Apulia and Calabria). In

2013, the migration curve peaked in Q3 with
24 000 migrants detected on this route. The
situation relaxed during the winter, but the
number climbed again to more than 53 000
in the second quarter of 2014. The upward
trend reported towards this summer clearly
exceeded the usual seasonal increase registered in previous years.

again. Information gathered through interviews with migrants conducted by Frontex
joint debriefing teams shows that facilitation
networks in Libya gathered migrants willing
to reach Italy in different safe houses along
the coast of Libya and Egypt until groups
were big enough to fill the available vessels
to the limit, thus maximising profits for the
facilitators.

According to Frontex operational data, the
months of April, June, July, August, and September 2014 successively broke all previous
records of irregular migration registered in
the Central Mediterranean. During the third
quarter, detections in the Central Mediterranean grew from 24 000 in July to 25 000
in August and 26 000 in September, which
was the highest monthly number reported
since the beginning of the FRAN data collection. However, compared to the summer
seasons of previous years, the figures also
point to a deceleration of growth, implying
a potential relaxation of the migration situation in the Mediterranean Sea for the consecutive months.

Compared to last quarter, the proportion
of migrants who left from Libya decreased
from around 88% in the last quarter to 79%
during the reporting period. This was mainly
due to more boats departing from Egypt.
The number of detected migrants coming
from this country increased from around
4 300 to 9 100. They frequently departed
from the coastal area of Alexandria aboard
wooden fishing boats, being later transferred
to larger wooden vessels that transported
them to Italy. Most migrants detected on
this route were Syrians and Egyptians and
an increasing number of Palestinian and Sudanese nationals.

As shown in Figure 6, the number of migrants detected in their attempt to cross the
Central Mediterranean peaked at regular intervals, such as in weeks 12, 15, 19, 23, 26, 29,
32, 34, and 37. After each peak, detections
decreased sharply and then gradually grew

Again, also migrants taking routes from Turkey to Italy were reported in Q3 2014. Almost
2 000 persons were detected on boats taking this lengthy trip across the Mediterranean
Sea. In some cases, Egyptian and Ukrainian
facilitators organised transfers on wooden

fishing boats from the Turkish town of Mersin. Mainly Syrian and, to a lesser extent, Afghan migrants in Turkey were advised by
facilitation networks operating from Istanbul to travel to Mersin and other ports of departure. Interviews conducted by debriefing
teams showed that during the journey some
of these boats also picked up Syrian nationals who had departed directly from the Syrian coast on smaller boats.
The Frontex JO Hermes 2014 was launched
on 1 May 2014 and was, initially, scheduled to
conclude on 30 September 2014. The operation was then extended under the umbrella
of the JO Hermes 2014 Extension. The aim of
the Joint Operation was the implementation
of coordinated operational activities for the
purpose of controlling irregular migration
flows and cross-border criminality from Tunisia, Algeria, Libya, and Egypt towards the
Pelagic Islands, Sicily, and Sardinia.
As during the previous quarter, a number of
factors added to increased migration from
North Africa. Firstly, good weather conditions made the Central Mediterranean Sea
more navigable. Secondly, the presence of a
large number of migrants from countries in
sub-Saharan Africa and the Horn of Africa as
well as Syrian, Palestinian, Bangladeshi, and
Pakistani nationals in coastal areas of Libya
increased the migratory pressure. Thirdly, the
increasingly unstable situation in Libya since
the fall of the Gaddafi regime led to a deteriorating economy, a lack of rule of law and
basic security functions, and consequently
to more migrant boats departing from the
Libyan coast.
On the other hand, criminal facilitation networks exploited the presence of assets deployed through the Operation Mare Nostrum.
Given the deployments of Italian search and
rescue capacities in proximity to the Libyan
coast, facilitators often used unseaworthy
boats and provided only short amounts of

petrol and water supplies for the sea crossing to Italy, thereby putting migrants’ lives at
risk. With the high number of boats departing from Libya, facilitation networks were
running short of vessels at their disposal, so
they often recovered the empty boats left
adrift and towed them back to Libya after
the migrants had been rescued by the Italian authorities.
The implementation of the Italian operation
Mare Nostrum, which aimed at preventing
loss of life at sea, was commenced in October 2013. This search and rescue operation was launched in response to the fatal
incident which occurred at the beginning of
October 2013, in which more than 300 migrants drowned after their boat capsized off
the Italian island of Lampedusa. The assets of
the Italian Navy deployed under Mare Nostrum had the capability of operating permanently at sea, in an operational area located
to the south of the Maltese search and rescue area and in the north of the Libyan search
and rescue area. This operation enabled the
early detection and rescue of migrant boats
in distress close to the Libyan coast.
Syrian migrants
The number of Syrian migrants detected in
the Central Mediterranean rose to a record
level. While during the third quarter of 2013,
fewer than 7 000 persons from the war-torn
country tried to cross the sea borders of Italy
and Malta, the number grew to more than
10 000 from the previous quarter. Between
July and September 2014, already 20 576 Syrian nationals were reported from this route.
The upward trend was mainly caused by a
50% increase in departures from Libya, from
where two thirds of the Syrian migrants had
left.
According to UNHCR, around 140 000 Syrian refugees are currently registered in Egypt.
Their situation has become more difficult

15 of 62

Frontex · FRAN Quarterly · q3 2014

mainly because of the introduction of a visa
obligation and the revocation of legal stay
for Syrian nationals and also for economic
reasons. Because of these increasingly problematic conditions, many refugees decided to
leave Egypt to go to Europe. A large number
of Syrians crossed the border from Salloum
to Bardiya in Libya and travelled in vans and
buses to departure areas, for example near
Zuwara and Benghazi.

started to be facilitated through Tunisia. The
whole journey was arranged from the countries of departure. Migrants got in contact
with these facilitation networks by wordof-mouth, in particular through relatives or
friends who previously travelled to the EU on
this route. The final price paid by migrants
varied from USD 5 500 to 7 000, including
airline tickets, facilitation though Algeria,
Libya and transfer to Italy.

Since March 2014, direct departures of Syrians
from Egypt to Italy have been gradually growing, almost reaching last year’s record numbers. Between the second and third quarter
of 2014, the number of Syrian nationals being detected on boats departing from Egypt
increased by 80%.

Eritrean migrants

On 26 August, a three-deck luxury yacht
from Egypt was detected with 449 migrants,
mostly Syrians, on board. According to the
debriefing teams, the interviewed migrants
stated that they had been offered a ‘VIP trip’
to Italy. The migrants initially boarded two
fishing vessels in the seaports of Damietta
and Baltim in Egypt, which transferred them
to the overloaded yacht. The case showed
that Egyptian networks also target comparably wealthy migrants for sea trips to Italy.
To reach Libya, an increasing number of Syrian nationals also used the air route from
Beirut (Lebanon), Istanbul (Turkey), or Amman (Jordan) to Algiers (Algeria) (see Fig. 7).
From Algiers airport, Algerian facilitation
networks transported them to Debdeb, located at the border with Libya. In Debdeb,
the Algerian facilitator transferred the migrants to a Libyan facilitator who then transported them illegally across the border and
further to the Libyan coast. According to
reports, however, as the passage has become unsafe due to a number of assaults
on migrants, Syrian nationals alternatively

After a five-month period of having been
the main nationality detected in the Central
Mediterranean, figures of Eritrean irregular migrants started to decrease in August.
Compared to the second quarter of 2014,
the number of Eritreans decreased by 20%,
from 16 782 to 13 340 reported during the
third quarter. Still, the level of detections was
more than twice as high as during the same
period of 2013.
Many Eritrean migrants travelled across Sudan with the help of well organised facilitators based in Karthoum and then crossed
the border to Libya. According to statements
given during debriefing interviews, the facilitation groups from both countries worked
well together, as handover procedures were
efficiently organised and included logistic arrangements, communication and payments.
The migrants were brought to the Libyan
coast.
This shows that the interconnectedness of
different facilitation groups has led to a certain degree of flexibility, allowing them after
some time to bypass law-enforcement activity or armed conflict. Hence a dip in detections at the EU borders may often point
to an operational adjustment conducted by
facilitation networks rather than to a reversal in migratory trends.

Migrants from sub-Saharan African
countries
The nationalities of 50% of the migrants coming from sub-Saharan African countries could
not be identified upon detection at the Italian
sea border. Since Q1 2014, unknown nationalities started to show up in significant numbers
in the FRAN statistics, due to large waves of
migrants arriving at the Italian sea borders.

Among the identified nationalities, Nigerians showed the largest increase since the
beginning of 2014. While one year ago, less
than 2 000 Nigerians were detected illegally trying to cross the sea borders to Italy
and Malta, the number in Q3 grew by 80%,
reaching the highest level since FRAN data
collection began in 2007.

Mediterranean Migrants: Human Trafficking
Gang ‘Took Organs as Payment’
A gang of human traffickers accepted migrants’ organs as
payment for smuggling them to Europe in a perilous journey from northern Africa, an Italian police investigation has
revealed.
The gang, composed by Libyans and Eritreans, allegedly demanded that asylum seekers pay EUR 1 500 (GBP 1 200) up
front to board one of the many run-down boats that leave
from the Tripoli area for Italy’s southernmost island of Lampedusa every week.
Those who could not immediately afford the price were given
the possibility to pay at a later stage, according to court documents seen by Corriere della Sera newspaper.
Upon their arrival on European soil, the gang decided
whether to ‘use them as manpower or organ donors,’ according to documents ordering pre-trial detention for five
gang-members.
Judge Tiziana Coccoluto wrote that the condition of migrants who had to pay off their debt was akin to that of
slaves, noting that the gang could also sell them off to other
criminal groups.
The group’s ‘treasurer’, who operated in Rome, was arrested
earlier this year along with four other men who allegedly
worked as money collectors across the Italian peninsula.
They are facing charges of being members of a criminal organisation aimed at smuggling migrants.
Police suspect that the gang was linked to human smugglers
responsible for a migrant boat that sank off Lampedusa in
October last year, killing 336 people.

An irregular Nigerian migrant told debriefers
in Italy that her ex-boyfriend assisted in her
migration to Libya, and that he forced her to
prostitute herself in order to pay the cost of
the facilitation. Several other Nigerian women
were apparently trafficked in the same way.
The interviewed migrant declared that she
intended to travel on to Rome and carry on
with prostitution.
Gambian irregular migrants again showed
up at the Central Mediterranean route in
higher numbers. The steady increase began
with more than 200 Gambian nationals in Q1
2013, leading to 2 607 detections in Q3, which
is the highest level recorded since FRAN data
collection began in 2007.
During debriefing interviews, a substantial
number of migrants from the Gambia, Ghana,
Mali, Nigeria and Senegal claimed that they
had been living in Libya for several months
or even years prior to their departure for Europe. The main reasons for leaving the country were political instability and inability to
find proper employment. Other irregular subSaharan migrants who recently arrived in
Libya stated that they have travelled via Algeria and mentioned the use of ‘forges’ or
‘African houses’, where migrants from subSaharan countries can stay while transiting
towards their final destination and which are
located in the surrounding areas of Tamanrasset, Ghardaia, Ouargla and Debdeb (Algeria), Gadamis, Dirj or Sabha (Libya). Others
travelled through the migration hub of Agadez in Niger and Awbari in Libya to reach the
boat departure places to Italy.

Maritime accidents and rescue
operations
In the third quarter of 2014, 67 452 persons
were rescued in 356 rapid rescue operations
undertaken by Italian authorities, assets deployed through the JO Hermes and civilian
vessels. In spite of these combined efforts,
several tragic accidents in overcrowded migrant boats led to 59 confirmed fatalities.*
On 11 September 2014, a wooden ship with irregular migrants sank 300 nm east of Malta.
According to unconfirmed information, the
boat departed from Damietta in Egypt on 6

September with approximately 500 migrants
aboard. Two of the migrants on board the
vessel were rescued by a Panamanian merchant ship and taken to Ragusa (Italy), while
six other migrants were rescued by British
and Lebanese merchant ships. These six migrants were transferred to a Hellenic Air Force
helicopter which transported them to Crete
(Greece). Statements given by the survivors
suggest that most of the migrants were from
Egypt, Palestine, Sudan, and Syria. Two Palestinian survivors of the wreck accused the
traffickers of intentionally sinking the vessel
after the migrants would not agree to transfer to a different ship.
On 18 July, a civilian vessel and Italian and
Maltese maritime assets rescued 644 irregular migrants aboard a fishing vessel while

Frontex · FRAN Quarterly · q3 2014

33 corpses were recovered from the boat.
There is an indication that they had died of
suffocation. Conscious about the proximity
of European search-and-rescue assets, facilitators during the reporting period have endangered the life of thousands of migrants
by transporting them in overloaded rickety
old wooden boats or aboard old inflatable
dinghies, which were constantly in danger
of capsizing with the consequential loss of
migrants’ lives.
4.2.3. Eastern Mediterranean route
During the reporting period, the number of
irregular migrants detected in their attempt
to reach the EU along the Eastern Mediterranean route reached a record of 22 339 persons. Compared to last quarter, the increase
was reported from all related border sections,
including the Greek and Bulgarian land border to Turkey. The growth in illegal migration,
however, was most significant in the eastern Aegean Sea, where the number of detections was five times higher than during the
third quarter of 2013 and almost three times
higher than in Q2 2014. Thus 84% of all detections on the Eastern Mediterranean route
were related to migrants attempting to reach
the EU by boat.
The proportion of those irregular migrants
who attempted to cross the Eastern Mediterranean sea border has increased for several reasons:
1.	In August 2012 the Greek authorities
launched the operation Aspida, deploying
additional manpower, assets and equipment to the Evros region in order to curb
and tackle illegal migration. The enhanced
surveillance and patrolling activities have
resulted in a remarkable drop in the number of apprehended irregular migrants and
a displacement of the migration flow towards the Bulgarian-Turkish border and
the eastern Aegean Sea.

20 of 62

2.	As a response to the increased pressure
at the Bulgarian-Turkish land border, the
Bulgarian authorities decided to implement an Integrated Border Surveillance
System (IBSS) to conduct enhanced air
surveillance, a special police operation and
to construct a 30-kilometre-long fence.
As can be seen in Figure 9, the abovementioned operational activities decreased the
detections of illegal land border-crossing in
the long term; however, they also led to a
displacement to the sea borders.
The proportions of the most common nationalities detected in the Eastern Mediterranean did not substantially change. As in
the last quarters, a stable majority of around
60% of the detections were related to Syrian nationals. However, the total number of
Syrian migrants on this route increased significantly from around 4 600 in Q3 2013 and
5 800 in Q2 2014 to almost 15 000 during
the reporting period. As the prolongation
of the conflict in Syria will further increase
war-related migration in the region, countries neighbouring Syria might reach their
capacity limits to maintain the large number of Syrian refugees.
Over the past few quarters, Afghan nationals
have accounted for a steady share of around
20% of the irregular migrants, but as in the
case of Syrians their total number increased
strongly. 5 458 Afghan migrants attempted
to reach the EU from Turkey – three times as
many as in the same period of last year (and
in the previous quarter). The increased migration of Afghan nationals was both caused
by political instability in Afghanistan and the
measures imposed by the Iranian government to regularise the stay of Afghans on
Iranian territory.
Moreover, the emergence of new conflict
areas, such as Iraq, might represent a new
source of migration. It can be assumed that

some of them will move towards the EU. The
number of Iraqi nationals actually detected at
the EU external borders with Turkey is comparably low but shows an upward trend, as it
increased from 58 in the previous quarter to
284 in the current reporting period.
With 363 detections, the number of Palestinians is almost twice as high as one year
ago, in Q3 2013. Most of them were originally
from Syria, mainly from the camps around
Damascus.

Screening activities in the Eastern
Mediterranean
Regular screening processes carried out on
some Greek islands, as well as at the GreekTurkish and Bulgarian-Turkish land borders,
revealed a high degree of falsely claimed
migrant nationalities. The presence of the
screening teams also has a preventive effect.
Migrants aware of being screened tended to
state their true nationality. Findings from the
screening procedures show that in most nationality swapping cases, migrants claimed to
originate from countries with widely known
armed conflicts.

Claimed Syrian turns out to be a Russian national
wanted for terrorist offences
A recent incident reported from Greece shows that in the
context of armed conflict in Iraq, Syria and other countries,
screening and debriefing activities are crucial for collecting information relevant for the security of the EU’s external borders.
On 5 September, Greek law-enforcement authorities arrested a Russian national of Chechen origin on the island of
Chios. An international arrest warrant had been issued for
this person for being involved in a terrorist attack in the Russian Federation. He was travelling with a group of 45 Syrians and, initially, he claimed to be of the same nationality.
Thorough investigations revealed that his true nationality
was Russian and that he was wanted for being involved in a
deadly attack upon a police convoy in the Russian Federation
in August 2009, which led to the death of five police officers
and the injury of four others. The suspect, who claimed to
have lived in Turkey since 2012, was detained by the Hellenic authorities of Chios Island and prepared for extradition to the Russian authorities.

extended armed conflicts in Syria and Iraq,
and the fact that the number of migrants
waiting in Turkey for an opportunity to enter the EU has been growing.
In order to reach the Greek Aegean Islands,
migrants used the services of well organised
facilitation networks with connections from
migrants’ countries of origin to their preferred
destination countries. The price for the facilitation services from Turkey to the Greek Islands varied from EUR 1 500 to EUR 2 500,
depending on the type of vessel provided: the
price was cheaper if travelling aboard inflatable rubber boats while it was more expensive to travel by yacht or speed boat. In fact,
facilitators used a wide range of transportation means to transport irregular migrants
to Greek territory: for instance, inflatable
boats, speed boats, plastic boats, yachts, jet
skis and even cargo ships. With regard to the
location of interceptions, a clear majority of
detections were made on the Greek islands,
while only 25–40% occurred at sea.

Eastern Aegean Sea
According to FRAN data from July to September 2014, almost 20 000 apprehensions of irregular migrants were reported
from the eastern Aegean Sea. Also previous
years showed a seasonal peak in the third
quarter, but the number of migrants detected in Q3 2014 was far higher than during any previous quarter since FRAN data
collection began. Although numbers also
grew at the land borders to Turkey, the increase has been particularly significant at
the sea borders. The decision of a majority of migrants in Turkey to opt for the sea
route was certainly caused by increased operational measures at the land borders to
Greece and Bulgaria. The reasons for the
overall growth however are related to the

22 of 62

Concerning the modus operandi used to reach
islands close to the Turkish shore, for example, Samos, Lesbos, and Chios, it became more
common that facilitation networks used inflatable boats without skippers on board. Interviews conducted by the joint debriefing
teams indicate that, upon embarkation from
the Turkish shore, facilitators instructed migrants on how to control the boat and gave
them directions in order to reach the Greek
Islands. Being aware of the tough Greek penal sanctions against migrant smuggling,
the facilitators thus avoided being apprehended by the Greek authorities. Moreover,
the migrants are instructed that, if they are
detected by the Hellenic Coast Guard, they
should destroy the boat in order to be rescued
and transferred to the Greek shore.
In the Dodecanese islands (Rhodes, Kos, Patmos, etc.), facilitators transported migrants
on boats and yachts close to islands, where

they were disembarked a short distance from
tourist areas and instructed to swim and pretend to be tourists. This modus operandi was
hard to detect, as the touristic areas were
not intensely patrolled and migrants could
easily mingle with other people.
Land border to Turkey
Since January 2014, the number of illegal border-crossings reported at the EU’s land border with Turkey has increased on a monthly
basis, reaching thus far 2 300 irregular migrants apprehended within the third quarter
of 2014. Also detections of clandestine entry
have increased massively, from less than 30
in Q3 2013 to almost 500 reported during the
reporting period.
Migration at the Bulgarian land border to
Turkey peaked in Q4 2013, with the number of apprehended migrants reaching the
highest level of detections since the FRAN
data collection began. As a consequence of
increased Bulgarian operational measures,
including an Integrated Border Surveillance
System (IBSS) and a special police operation,
the level of detections decreased in the following quarter, but illegal border-crossing
continuously grew again to more than 1 500
detections in Q3 2014. More than 70% of the
detected migrants here were Syrians and
around 11% Afghans.
Irregular migration at the Turkish-Greek land
border also increased, however at a lower
rate. Here, illegal border-crossings grew by a
third since previous quarter and doubled compared to the third quarter of 2013. Two quarters of the apprehended migrants claimed to
be Syrians; however, a large proportion of
non-Syrians claiming to be from Syria should
be taken into consideration when analysing
the picture. Interestingly, the share of Iraqi
nationals among irregular migrants was highest at this border sections, thus ranking second with 119 detections.

4.2.4. Western Mediterranean route
In the western Mediterranean region, which
consists of several areas of the southern
Spanish coast as well as the land borders of
Ceuta and Melilla, the numbers of detections
of illegal border-crossing between Morocco
and the Iberian Peninsula almost doubled and
reached close to 3 000 apprehension in the
third quarter of 2014. Migration in this region
has usually peaked during the third quarters
of each year, but in 2014, the months between
July and September showed the most intensive migration since 2011.
Overall numbers point to an increasing migration pressure along this route, although
influenced by seasonal factors. Conflicts and
violence in Mali, Sudan, South Sudan, Cameroon, Nigeria, Chad and the Central African Republic have caused the displacement
of large parts of the population and have
added to the economic causes of migration
in the region. Thus, increased numbers of
sub-Saharan migrants and of persons trying to cross to Spain are stranded in Moroccan coastal areas.
Additional technical and operational measures at the land border to the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla reduced migration
there significantly. Most migrants detected at
the borders to Ceuta and Melilla were from
sub-Saharan countries. Guinean migrants
proved to be the largest migrant group, but
also many Syrians were apprehended at the
borders to the Spanish enclaves.
At the sea border, the JO EPN Indalo 2014
was hosted by Spain and started on 3 June
2014. As envisaged, the operation ended on
31 October 2014. The operational area was
divided into five zones situated along the
Spanish coast between the Strait of Gibraltar and the city of Cartagena.

Morocco, while the remaining 10% attempted

Figure 11 shows that a large majority of detections made in the context of the JO EPN
Indalo was made in week 33 (11–17 August
2014). Indeed, on 11–12 August, an unexpected
and sharp increase in arrivals has been reported from the operational area of Algeciras. The Spanish Search and Rescue Services
(SASEMAR) started a massive SAR operation detecting and intercepting a considerable number of toy boats and rescuing more
than 1 200 migrants that were transported
to Tarifa Sea Port.

In the third quarter of 2014, the proportion of
migrants detected while trying to cross the
Strait of Gibraltar was reported to have increased to a record share of almost 90% of
all apprehensions at the Western Mediterranean route. More than 70% of the irregular migrants reported from the sea border
were nationals of sub-Saharan countries, with
the top-ranking nationality being Cameroonian migrants. The second-ranking nationality
showed to be Algerian nationals. Around 90%

per person) and the same type of boats are
used: either boats with 255 kg capacity with
6–7 persons on board or boats with 400 kg
capacity carrying 10–11 persons.

However, there was a clear change in the modus operandi: according to the intelligence
sourced from debriefing activities, the migrants gathered in large crowds to cross the
Strait of Gibraltar, resembling the strategies
used to cross the fence to the area of Melilla.
Although some migrants were apprehended,
the vast majority could get away and start
the sea-crossing.
4.2.5. Western African route
In the third quarter of 2014, fewer than 50
detections of illegal border-crossing were reported from this region. All persons detected
during the current reporting period were
from sub-Saharan African countries. Back in
2009, the annual number of detections still
exceeded 2 000 migrants. In spite of minor
peaks during the summer of 2013 and in the
current reporting period, illegal crossings of
the sea borders between Morocco and mainly
the Canary Islands has generally remained on
a significantly lower level. Of key importance
for maintaining the low numbers of detections at the border are sustained high levels
of surveillance (ensuring early detections) and
collaboration with third-country authorities.
4.2.6. Western Balkan route
During the analysed period there were 7 157
detections of illegal border-crossing at the EU
borders to the Western Balkan countries in
the northern part of the wider region (Hungary, Croatia), which represents a sharp 170%
increase compared to the previous quarter,
and a 48% increase compared to the corresponding period of last year.
In Q3 2014, the Hungarian-Serbian border
section remained clearly the busiest in terms
of illegal border-crossings. In the analysed
quarter this border section registered a 193%
increase compared with the previous quarter
and a 53% increase compared to the peak recorded in the same period of 2013.

As regards to nationalities detected by Hungary, detections increased in comparison with
the previous quarter both considering regional nationalities, especially Kosovo* citizens (+334%), as well as non-regional
nationalities, such as Syrians (+386%), Afghans
(+123%) and Palestinians (+299%). An increase
in the number of Iraqi migrants can be noticed compared to the second quarter of 2014,
but the detections still remained at a low
level. However, as Frontex operational activities at the Greece-Turkey borders indicate
that Iraqi nationals sometimes claim to be
Syrians, their overall increase could be higher
than the numbers show.

* This designation is
without prejudice to
positions on status, and is
in line with UNSCR 1244
and the ICJ Opinion on
the Kosovo declaration of
independence.

The composition of the flow in the entire
region still indicates continued secondary
movements from Greece/Turkey through the
Western Balkans and onwards to EU Member
States. Indeed, the current increase in detections also corresponds with the rising inflow
of migrants from Turkey to Greece and with
the reported increase of detections of Syrians and Afghans moving from Greece towards
Albania and/or the former Yugoslav Republic
of Macedonia, and further on to Serbia. The
Western Balkan route does remain a viable
alternative to the direct sea crossing from
Greece/Turkey to Italy, mostly due to the
lower costs of facilitation as indicated by information collected in the context of Frontex Joint Operations.
4.2.7. Circular migration from Albania to
Greece
Prior to being granted visa free access to the
Schengen area in late 2010, Albanian nationals were regularly detected in high numbers
illegally crossing their land border into Greece.
Since visa liberalisation, Albanians are still
detected illegally crossing the border into
Greece but at a lower level. Moreover, there
was a high level of refusals of entry (mostly
for having an alert in the SIS) and also document fraud (counterfeit border-crossing

stamps to fabricate travel histories and extended periods of stay in the Schengen area).

increase was mainly due to more detections
by Lithuania and Estonia.

In Q3 2014, Greece reported more than 2 000
illegal border-crossings at its land border with
Albania and over 200 at its land border with
the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Specifically, detections of Albanians at
the Greek-Albanian border increased by 8%
compared to the last quarter, continuing the
upward trend that started in the beginning
of 2014. In contrast, detections of Albanians
at the Greece-FYR Macedonia border decreased by around 17%. Refusals of entry of
Albanians at these border sections decreased
by almost 30% since the previous quarter.
Effective returns of Albanians conducted by
Member States increased in Q3 2014 by 6%
compared to the previous quarter.

In terms of nationalities there was a sharp
increase of nationals of Vietnam from 27 in
the previous quarter to 115 in the third quarter. The majority of detections were made by
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.

4.2.8. Eastern land borders route
The eastern land borders route represents a
combination of detections of illegal bordercrossing reported from the green borders of
Norway, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania,
Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, and Romania. Despite the total length of all the border sections, detections tend to be lower than on
other routes – possibly due to the long distances between major hubs and countries
of origin and a large amount of impassable terrain.
According to information shared throughout 2013 and 2014, visa fraud and counterfeit border-crossing stamps tend to be more
predominant on this route as detections of
illegal border-crossing (see Section 4.8. Document fraud).
In the third quarter 2014 there were 369 illegal border-crossings reported from the eastern borders, which represented an increasing
trend when compared with the second quarter of 2014 (218) as well as when compared to
the corresponding period of 2013 (469). This

Considering Member States borders with
Ukraine, the number of detections of illegal
border-crossing remained very moderate (131)
despite the armed conflict in Eastern Ukraine.
The same applies for detections of illegal border-crossing of Ukrainian nationals at the
Eastern land borders of the EU (47). Moreover, only 16 of these were linked to migration.
The impact of the Ukrainian conflict is still felt
mostly in the growing number of asylum applications, mostly made inland within the EU,
as well as in the growing number of detections of illegal stay by the EU Member States.
Changes in modi operandi of Moldovan irregular migrants after the granting of visa liberalisation have led to an expected shift from
illegal border-crossings to the abuse of legal
entry. During the third quarter there were
only eight illegal border-crossings by Moldovan nationals reported by EU Member States
(down from 56 during the corresponding period of the last year). However, at the same
time detections of illegal stay increased from
790 in Q3 of 2013 and 392 during the second
quarter of 2014 to 1 035 in the third quarter of 2014.

4.3. Clandestine entry
The analysis of the FRAN indicator on detections of illegal border-crossing at BCPs
(1B) (e.g. hiding in means of transport) at the
external land and sea borders of the EU reveals relatively low detections for the whole
of the EU compared with other indicators
of irregular migration. However, since 2013,
clandestine entries have increasingly gained

The long-term increase of travellers hiding
in lorries, buses and trains, relates to a large
extent to one travel direction: irregular migrants entering the EU from Turkey and moving through South-East Europe towards the
countries in central, western and northern
Europe. For this reason, the increase is most
significant in Bulgaria, where the migratory
flow is channelled before it splits into several
routes across the various countries of that region. In Q3 2014, almost twice as many irregular migrants were reported from Bulgaria as
in Q2. All incidents were related to the country’s land border with Turkey.
The increase in detections of clandestine entry at this border section is likely to be linked
to the strengthened surveillance along the
land border with Turkey that triggered migrants to find alternative ways into the EU.
Reports from Frontex JO Focal Points Land
point to an increasingly observed modus operandi at the BCP of Kapitan Andreevo between
Bulgaria and Turkey: Shortly before the border control, at the waiting area for lorries, migrants attempted to climb under the trailers
and to situate themselves on the axles (see
Fig. 12). After the lorry had proceeded and
stopped at the actual passport and customs
control, they abandoned their hiding place
and tried to leave the control area between
the waiting vehicles. As hiding on vehicle axles poses a significant risk of slipping off and
getting under the wheels, the method was
only used for very short distances.
Also detections of clandestine entry reported
by Croatia in Q3 2014 – all at its land border
with Serbia – have increased by 75% since

relevance in the overall picture of migration
to Europe. In Q3 2014, the highest number to
date of 965 detections were reported at EU
level, which is almost sixteen times as much
as in Q3 2013 and 50% more than during the
previous quarter.

Figure 12. As hiding on lorry axles is a very
dangerous modus operandi, clandestine
migrants can only use it for very short
routes, such as within border-control areas

the previous quarter. Considerable lorry traffic goes through this border section, in particular from the Western Balkans but also in
transit from Turkey to the EU. The situation
at the border between Serbia and Hungary
is similar, where reports of clandestine entry have increased by 150% since the previous quarter.
As can be seen in Figure 13, in Croatia, Bulgaria and particularly Hungary, most clandestine migrants are Afghan nationals. Syrian
nationals are almost equally prevalent among
stowaways detected in Bulgaria and Croatia, but notably they were hardly detected in
Hungary. Interestingly, migrants from Myanmar are the third ranking nationality for deFigure 13. Most clandestine entrants are Afghans in Croatia, Bulgaria,
and Hungary

tections of clandestine migrants, but they
only started to be reported to FRAN after
April 2014 and only from the Bulgarian border to Turkey.
In contrast to the borders in south-eastern
Europe, Spain reported a decline in detections of clandestine migrants. The number
decreased by 50% since the previous quarter, mostly involving Guinean and Algerian
nationals.

4.4. Detections of facilitators
* This designation is without
prejudice to positions on
status, and is in line with
UNSCR 1244 and the ICJ
Opinion on the Kosovo
declaration of independence.

After five years of decreasing detections of
facilitators of irregular migration, numbers
have been rising again since the beginning
of 2013. More facilitators were arrested particularly by Spain, Bulgaria, Switzerland and
Greece, although the criminal networks became increasingly cautious. A widespread
shift towards the abuse of legal channels
and document fraud have allowed facilitators to operate remotely and inconspicuously rather than accompanying migrants
during high-risk activities such as bordercrossings. On several routes, an increasing
number of cases of facilitation networks not
accompanying the migrant boats to the EU
are reported.
On the other hand, the expanded logistical
and organisational structures of the facilitation networks and the increased capacities
to transport migrants across the Mediterranean Sea and Europe’s land borders apparently led to a greater exposure of these
criminal groups to police investigations and
consequently to more arrests.
During the third quarter of this year, FRAN
data shows 2 809 detections of facilitators
of irregular migration, 6% more than during
the previous quarter and around 50% more
than in Q3 2013. The top five Member States
(Spain, Italy, France, Greece and Bulgaria) reported almost 80% of the detections.

28 of 62

The fact that most facilitators were arrested
by Mediterranean countries may indicate that
more complex sea border-crossings require
more involvement from local facilitation networks. Correspondingly, a substantial share
of 977 of the reported facilitators were nationals of Spain, Italy, and Greece or from Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, and
Turkey. Since Q3 2013, the number of arrested
facilitators from these Mediterranean countries has increased by 35%. Interestingly, the
number of arrested facilitators from southeast European countries, i.e. Albania, Bosnia
and Herzegovina, Greece, Kosovo*, Romania,
Serbia, but particularly from Bulgaria have
also increased compared to one year ago (in
total by +50%).

4.5. Refusals of entry
The recorded 31 000 refusals of entry at the
EU external borders in Q3 2014 represent a
16% increase compared to the previous quarter. It is the highest reported number in 2014,
although it does remain 8% below the number of refusals of entry recorded in Q3 2013.
The main contributing factor for this is that
during Q2 and Q3 of 2013 there was an unusual increase in Russian citizens, especially of
Chechen origin attempting to cross the EU’s
external borders through Poland. Since the
exceptional numbers of 2013, refusals of entry for Russian citizens were down 65% compared to one year ago at the Polish-Belarus
border, while the number of refusals issued
to Georgian citizens at this border section
also continued to drop (-65% compared to
Q3 2013). In the longer-term perspective, almost all third quarters saw the highest rates
of refusals of entry since FRAN data collection began (apart from 2013). This was also
the case in 2014.
The border type where fluctuations in the
reported numbers of refusals of entry predominantly seem to take place are the external land borders (see Fig. 14), while the

numbers for air and sea borders usually remain at a comparably stable level.

Figure 14. Q3 has the highest refusals of entry figures so far in 2014, as
has normally been the case each year (except for 2013)
Quarterly refusals of entry according to border type since 2011

Despite Poland reporting 26% less refusals
of entry compared to Q3 2013, it remains the
country reporting the highest number related
to this indicator in Q3 2014 representing an increase of 35% on the previous quarter, equivalent to more than twice as much as the UK,
which recorded the second most refusals of
entry in Q3 2014.

Ukrainians continued to be the principal nationality refused entry to the EU (5 198). Refusals of entry for this nationality in Q3 2014
were 35% higher than in the previous quarter (3 844) and 17% higher compared to Q3
2013 (4 424). Most refusals of entry to Ukrainian citizens were issued at the Ukrainian land
borders with Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, and
Romania. The majority of those were refused entry because they did not have appropriate documentation for the purpose
of stay or lacked a valid visa or residence
permit. This trend coincides with more detections of Ukrainians attempting to enter
Poland with fraudulently obtained visas reported through the EDF-RAN (see Section
4.8. Document fraud).
Russians were the second most frequently
refused nationality at the external borders of
the EU. After their numbers subsided following a peak in Q2 2013, they have again been
on the rise since Q1 2014, albeit still 46% less
than the equivalent reporting period in 2013.
Although Belarusians only ranked fifth for the
number of refusals of entries issued EU wide,
their numbers were at the highest level since
2011 (1 473), up 34% since the same reporting
period of last year. A mild rising trend since
Q1 2014 has been noticeable, nevertheless
this has remained within a relatively stable
long term range.

The most often cited reasons for refusals of
entry at the EU external borders continued
to be the lack of a valid visa or residence permit and the lack of documentation justifying
the purpose and conditions of stay, which
has previously also been the case. However,
there has been a slightly decreasing trend in
refusals due to a lack of documentation justifying the purpose and conditions of stay,
with 1.1% less reported compared to Q2, and
down 11% on Q3 2013.
At the same time the number of refusals of
entry as a result of alerts in the Schengen Information System or national registers continued to rise (3 305) albeit with small margins
since Q4 2013, showing a 23% rise on one year
earlier (2 689). Also displaying an ascending
trend were the number of travellers refused
entry because they had already stayed for
a period of three months within a given six
month period (1 929), being 27% higher than in
Q2 2014 and 71% higher than the same reporting period a year earlier. For both the above
cited reasons the main refused nationalities
were from the Western Balkan region, mainly
Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Serbia. The

main border sections they attempted to enter the EU through reflected their country’s
geographical location (see Fig. 16).

4.6. Returns
There were 65 165 third country nationals in
Q3 2014 issued with an obligation to leave the
EU following an administrative or judicial decision. This is 8% more than in the previous
quarter, while representing a 13% increase on
the same quarter of 2013. It is important to
note that the absolute total number of migrants subject to return decisions is likely to
be more than the reported figure given the
fact that data was unavailable inter alia from
France, the Netherlands and Sweden, which
are likely to have generated a high num-

30 of 62

ber of decisions. Similarly as for Q1 and Q2,
there is also missing data in Q3 on decisions
for Austria, as a result of an overhaul in their
reporting system.
Throughout the EU, Syrians ranked highest in
terms of return decisions issued (8 399), which
was a rise of 58% compared to the previous
quarter and is the highest figure reported for
any quarter for Syrians. Formal return decisions issued to this nationality in Greece
and Bulgaria represented increases of 167%
and 250%, respectively, on Q3 2013. Another
emerging pattern in both Greece and Bulgaria is the number of return decision issued
to Afghan nationals compared to the previous quarter, amounting to a rise of 300% in
Bulgaria and 106% in Greece.

During the reporting period, 38 984 effective
returns took place, which is 4% less than the
previous quarter, and 5% less than Q3 of 2013.
In general, the highest number of effective
returns were carried out by the UK, as has
been the case in previous reporting periods,
with the main returned nationalities being Indian and Pakistani. Greece is responsible for
carrying out the second highest number of
effective returns, the vast majority of which
concerned Albanian nationals.
It is important to note that at Member State
level there is often an inconsistency between
the number of return decisions issued by authorities and the number of effective returns
actually carried out. These differences may
be down to time lags between judicial de-

cisions and physical returns, while the disappearance of migrants once a decision has
been reached can also play a role.
One of the exceptions to the general pattern
of less effective returns than return decisions
issued, concerns Albanians whose rate of effective returns (6 593) actually exceeds the
number of return decisions (5 228) issued in
Q3 2014. This is most likely down to a large
backlog of return decisions that are being
implemented with a time lag.
In contrast, an example that cannot be explained by the time lag, is the case of Syrians
of whom only 622 were effectively returned
(mostly to Turkey and Serbia) despite the high
figures of return decisions issued to them in

Despite the large increase in return decisions
issued by Greece compared to the previous
quarter (43%), the number of effective returns did not rise at a similar rate (3%). Additionally to the time lag between procedures,
an important factor is that nearly half of the
additional return decisions were issued to Syrian nationals whose rate of effective return
is very low across the EU due to the ongoing conflict in Syria.

The Four-Tier Access Control Model, one of
the pillars of the conceptual foundation of
Frontex, underlines the importance of understanding secondary migration in order to
supplement the knowledge coming from the
performance of border control and on the situation in neighbouring and third countries.
Since the beginning of 2014, Member States
have therefore started to regularly collect
quantitative information on indicators related to secondary movements.

The main data used for this section were detections made within the EU of persons travelling from the external border to their final
destination without proper travel documentation (for further methodological aspects
and definitions see Chapter 2. Methodology).
The data collected within the EU is less consistent than the data collected along the ex-

ternal border because movements between
Schengen countries are not subject to systematic border controls conducted by national authorities.
This part will contain subsections on illegal
stay and asylum as these are the primary
indicators affecting intra-Schengen move-

ments. Whilst the figures in Q3 still show
many migrants moving within the EU in even
larger numbers than before, their modus operandi has largely remained unchanged, nevertheless some emerging trends were noted,
which will be the main focus of the following section.

On a more general scale, Syrians saw the
largest increase in numbers – by 76%. Syrians were both the largest increase in relative terms, as well as being the most detected
nationality.
France, however, saw much higher detection
numbers of Eritreans more than double the
number of Tunisians, who were the second
most detected nationality.

4.7.1. Illegal stay
Numbers of illegal stay detections have continued to climb. From a longer-term perspective, Q3 2014 saw an increase of roughly 42%
over Q3 2013.

4.7.2. Asylum
Asylum claims showed an increase of 45%
compared to Q2 2014, and of 69% compared to Q3 of last year. Germany, Sweden
and Italy were the countries with the most
reported asylum applications. These three
countries accounted for 59% of all asylum
applications.

As in Q2, Sweden, Germany and France
were the top countries for illegal stay detections. Both Sweden and Germany made
over 10 000 more detections than France –
the third highest reporting country. In Sweden, detections of Syrians were double that
of the next most detected nationality (Eritreans). Germany also had a relatively large
difference between the number of Syrians
and Eritreans, which were also the top two
most detected nationalities.

For individual countries, the difference between Q3 2013 and Q3 2014 was also very
pronounced; in Hungary the number of applications doubled, whilst in Italy they increased by 474% and in Denmark by 262%.

The UK had the smallest upward change,

Whilst the number of asylum applicants has
been increasing in Italy over the past year,
Q3 saw the reported number increase significantly. The largest share of asylum seekers

reported by Italy were Nigerian (15%), Malian (15%), Gambian (12%), and Pakistani (12%).
This is at odds with previous years, where
the number of asylum applicants was much
lower in Italy, with a larger percentage of irregular migrants moving northwards before
applying for asylum.

4.7.3. Intra-EU/Schengen secondary
movements
Entry point Southern Europe
For Southern Europe entries, a general northward movement towards Sweden, Germany
and the Netherlands to apply for asylum was
identified. Routes would often take migrants
either through Austria or France and then
into Germany, at which point they would either settle, or go northwards to Sweden or
north-eastwards to the Netherlands and Belgium. Interestingly, a relatively large number
of migrants applied for asylum in Switzerland and Austria in Q3, which renders them
as more popular destination countries than
France, which reported a lower number of
asylum applications.
Figure 22 shows the fluctuation of asylum applications in the top five destination countries targeted by Syrians (Sweden, Germany,
the Netherlands, Bulgaria, Denmark) from Q3
2013 to Q3 2014, compared with detections

large margin. The graph demonstrates how

followed by similar variations in the number
of asylum applications in destination countries a month later. As noted in the Q2 2014
issue of FRAN Quarterly report, this gives a
similar indication of a travel time of roughly
a month between arrival at the border and
application for asylum.
Having had a closer look at the intra-Schengen movement patterns of Eritreans and Syrians several notable conclusions can be drawn.
Most pertinent is that there seem to be two
main routes from Italy to the rest of Europe,
one westerly and one northerly.
The destination country was less often France
(except in the case of Syrian asylum seekers
who have family ties in France) but more often the UK via northern ports such as Calais.
Diasporas already established in northern
countries helped their compatriots with their
onward travel from Italy, for instance by providing authentic travel documents. Money
transfers were tracked from Northern European countries to a neutral contact in Africa
who then paid the local facilitation networks
on behalf of the migrants. An interesting
fact here is that facilitation networks in Af-

rica were highly organised in aiding migrants
from their destination country to a specific
part of Europe, as opposed to facilitators in
Europe who are more opportunistic and focus on shorter parts of a route.

Facilitation advertisements
Many reports speak of the UK being propagated as an ‘El
Dorado’ for migrants by smugglers – somewhere that migrants can find access to benefits, housing and work. This
has also been seen in relation to Sweden, where easier reunification with family is touted and in relation to Germany,
where the fast processing of asylum claims are advertised
by facilitators.

Entry point Eastern Europe
At the eastern borders, there have been indications of emerging trends, most notably an
increase in the number of Ukrainians seeking asylum in the EU and of asylum seekers
from the Caucasus region entering Lithuania/
Latvia.
The significant growth in the number of
Ukrainian asylum applicants in the EU started
in March 2014 and continued to rise; exceeding 1 000 applicants per month for the first
time in July. This is in contrast to the period
2008–2013, when the flow was very stable
at EU level and averaged roughly 100 applicants per month.* In particular Ukrainian
asylum claims are being filed in Poland, Germany, Italy, Sweden and, to a lesser extent,
Spain, Austria and the Czech Republic. This
increase in the number of Ukrainian asylum
seekers can clearly be linked to the crisis taking place in Ukraine since the beginning of
2014, as demonstrated by the highlighted
section in Figure 23.
In conjunction with the rise in asylum applications, the number of Ukrainian illegal
stayers in the EU also increased, especially
in Poland, which noted a 93% increase from
the 2014 Q1 to Q3, reaching unprecedented
levels for Poland since FRAN data collection
began. To a lesser extent, Ukrainians registered as illegal stayers in Hungary, Germany,
and especially Sweden are also on the rise.
At the eastern borders, there was a growing
trend of entries in Lithuania and Latvia of migrants coming from the Caucasus region.
From Latvia and Lithuania, these migrants
typically move towards Poland and likely fur-

Frontex debriefing activities in the framework of the Agency’s coordinated Joint Operations confirm that social media
platforms such as Facebook and Twitter are used to share
information on how to enter the EU illegally and the destinations available. This allows a sort of ‘shopping’ by migrants to find the most suitable deal for them, which is
likely one of the reasons behind a concerted move by
certain nationalities towards particular destinations.

Kosovo* citizens transiting through Hungary
In Q3 2014 Kosovo* citizens filed more than 3 000 asylum applications in Hungary representing a 736% increase compared to the previous quarter making it the second largest number of asylum applications by
Kosovo* citizens in any EU country (after the large numbers in Hungary between January and July 2013).
Changes in the Hungarian asylum policy are most probably linked to the change in the migratory trends of
Kosovo* citizens. In July 2013 amendments were introduced in line with new EU legislation to include exceptional instances when asylum seekers could be detained in asylum centres, as a result of which the number
of Kosovo* citizens dropped dramatically between August 2013 and May 2014. In June 2014 numbers started
to rise again with over 2 000 Kosovo* citizens claiming asylum in September 2014 alone. This may have been
down to the fact that a renewed immigration policy was introduced in 2014, which offered an integration
contract for those receiving refugee status and financial support of roughly EUR 300 per person per month,
which for family units could be considered a significant amount compared to their earnings in their country
of origin. Until migrants are granted refugee status they received a more humble EUR 3 per person per day
for their subsistence, however from October this subsistence allowance is offered in kind instead.
Another factor in the increased movement of Kosovo* citizens towards Hungary may be the recent changes
to further facilitate their travel through Serbia with the introduction of additional border crossing points
that can be crossed without a travel document. This means an ID card is enough, or in the case of minors
a birth certificate will suffice.
It should be noted that the movement of Kosovo* citizens normally does not culminate in them staying in
Hungary. In many instances, applying for asylum in Hungary is a result of apprehension, while the intention remains to abscond and move further towards Western Europe. To highlight this, a trend has been noticed whereby Kosovo* citizens increasingly arrive in family units, which guarantees stay in open asylum
centres and, therefore, make absconding easier. The intention to leave Hungary is underlined by the fact
that Hungary has the highest rate of withdrawn asylum applications in the EU, with 1 165 terminated in
Q3 2014 alone according to Eurostat data. Indeed the further movement of Kosovo* citizens is reflected in
the number of asylum applications by this group rising in Austria (72%), Germany (78%) and Sweden (126%)
compared to Q2 2014.

In addition to Kosovo** citizens (see box),
large numbers of Afghans and Syrians also
applied for asylum in Hungary during Q3 (over
2 000 for each of the two nationalities) while
at the same time there were 1 375 and 1 055
withdrawn asylum applications respectively
by these nationality groups according to Eurostat. After entering Hungary, the majority
of Afghans and Syrians seem to be continuing along the same route as Kosovo** citizens through Austria and Germany, possibly
all the way to Sweden.
This movement is underlined by the fact that
the number of Afghan nationals registered as
illegal stayers doubled both in Austria and
Germany and rose by 37% in Sweden compared to Q2, while the number of their asylum applications also doubled in Austria; rose
by 15% in Germany, and by 38% in Sweden.
Asylum applications by Afghans also rose in
Italy by 35%, indicating that some Afghans
decide to opt for Italy as their destination.

the irregular migrants are usually discovered
as a result of calls for help due to a lack of air
or dehydration from within the lorry.

* Information from the
Lithuanian State Border
Guard Service website

A recent cooperation agreement between
the UK and France has been announced as
a means to curb the number of irregular migrants trying to reach the UK through Calais. A Joint Intervention Fund will be set up,
with British authorities pledging to spend
EUR 15 million over three years to improve
security in the port of Calais. This will be in
addition to stepping up police cooperation
between the two countries to fight smuggling networks, and creating information
campaigns to discourage migrants attempting to cross.

4.8. Document fraud
4.8.1. Document fraud on entry to the
EU/Schengen area from third countries
In Q3 2014 there were just over 2 400 detections of document fraudsters on entry
to the EU/Schengen area from third countries, which shows to be a continuation of
the increase which has been seen since the
beginning of 2014.

Reports of irregular migrants crowding in
France at the border to the UK have become
common. This has been most widely reported
in Calais, but due to more determined responses by authorities, other ferry terminals
have been targeted by irregular migrants. Interestingly, all indicators have demonstrated
that those applying for asylum in the UK, detected staying illegally and subsequently returned, are – with the exception of Eritreans
– mostly from nationalities that have relatively low numbers of detections across the
EU (such as Pakistani and Iranian).

Italy, Hungary, Poland, France, and Spain reported the most detections of document
fraudsters on entry at the external border,
together accounting for almost two thirds of
all document fraud cases at EU level.

A number of incidents of irregular migrants
hiding in refrigerated lorries have also been

Italy saw a 19% increase in cases of document fraud since Q2 2014 and almost reached

the airports of Male (Maldives) and Istanbul (Turkey).

Frontex · FRAN Quarterly · q3 2014

EDF data collection started. 75% of all cases
were related to Ukrainian nationals.

4.8.3. Between the Schengen area and
non-Schengen EU Member States

The number of detections reported from the
Spanish external borders has been increasing
since winter 2012/2013, but dropped by 10%
in Q3 2014 compared to the previous quarter. Most of the detections were related to
Moroccans and Syrians.

Apart from document fraud committed at
the external border, also 1 091 cases of document fraud were detected between the
Schengen area and non-Schengen EU Member States, as well as between two nonSchengen EU Member States, representing a
40% increase compared to the previous quarter. As during the previous quarters, many of
these were reported on entry to the UK, a
common destination country for irregular migrants travelling from the Schengen area. In
this case, the most commonly detected migrants were from Albania.

Since last quarter, French authorities experienced a 20% decrease in the detections of
document fraud on entry from third countries.
At EU level, of the 160 nationalities detected using fraudulent documents to illegally enter the EU or Schengen area from a
third county, the most commonly detected
were from Syria, Morocco and Ukraine. Syrians were detected at a wide range of locations. Moroccans on the other hand were
detected mostly on entry from Morocco to
Spain in Ceuta and Melilla. Ukrainian nationals were uncovered mostly at Polish land
border crossing points.
4.8.2. Document fraud on exit from the
EU/Schengen area to third countries
In addition to the detections on entry there
were also 789 detections of persons using
fraudulent documents on exit, which represented an increase of more than 20% compared to the previous quarter, but remains
at a similar level to Q3 2013. Thus, around a
fourth of detections were made on exit but
this is likely to be an underestimation of the
situation on the ground as checks are less
stringent on exit than they are on entry.
On the other hand, a number of Member
States reported that a third or more of their
cases were on exit, such as France, Poland,
Hungary, Bulgaria, Belgium, Slovenia, Croatia, Denmark, Slovakia and Latvia. Romania,
Cyprus and Malta detected more document
fraudsters on exit than on entry.

40 of 62

4.8.4. Intra-Schengen flights
The EDF-RAN data exchange also considers detections of document fraud on intraSchengen flights (and to a minor extent ferry
connections) where no border checks are systematically performed. Since EDF data collection began, intra-Schengen detections have
been showing modest highs during the spring
and summer season, while during most winter months, less detections were reported. In
the third quarter of 2014, 1 387 detections of
document fraud on intra-Schengen flights
were reported.
Apart from the seasonal fluctuations, detection numbers reported during the last three
years showed a rather upward tendency,
which intensified after Q3 2013. One year
ago, the number of intra-Schengen detections reached only 72% of the current level.
Interestingly, the number of fraudulent documents presented by EU/SAC nationals have
been steadily increasing since EDF data collection began, peaking at 327 in Q3 2014.
Fraudulent documents detected in particular on intra-Schengen flights increased most
(+45% since Q2 2014), with a majority of cases
related to routes from Greece to Italy. On

4.9.2. Smuggling of excise goods at the
eastern borders

4.9.1. Trafficking in human beings

In the third quarter of 2014, the number of tobacco smuggling incidents reported through
Frontex Joint Operations increased, when
compared to the second quarter of 2014.
Even though border guards reported almost
34% more incidents (143 in Q3 compared to
99 in Q2) through the JO Focal Points Land,
the quantity of seized cigarettes was much
lower than in the second quarter. Nearly 60%
of the detections took place at the borders
with Ukraine and Moldova, namely at the
Moldovan-Romanian border section and at
the Ukrainian-Polish border section, while the
borders with Belarus were less affected. A visible increase was noted, however, at the borders of the Russian Federation, namely with
Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland, when compared to Q2 2014.

Sexual assault along trafficking routes has
been an increasingly reported problem. NGOs
and the Director of the Ministry of Employment and Social Security of the Spanish Government have reported that almost all
Nigerian women that reach Morocco have
experienced sexual abuse before they arrived
at CETI* reception centres in Spain.

* Centro de Estancia
Temporal de Inmigrante

As in Q2, a number of cases of rituals or
ceremonies to tie victims to the traffickers
were reported. A particularly violent group
of ‘juju traffickers’ were sentenced to jail in
the UK after having raped and cut a Nigerian woman as part of a binding ceremony
before forcing her to go to Italy to work as
a prostitute.

Similarly to previous quarters, the modi operandi related to illicit cigarettes remained unchanged with contraband hidden in personal
belongings, in specially constructed places
of vehicles or amongst cargo transported
on lorries and trains. Cigarettes were also
carried across green land borders or pulled
across rivers. Apart from cigarettes with excise stamps of Ukraine, Belarus and the Russian Federation, cases of tobacco products

Albanian trafficking groups were heavily targeted by law enforcement. In August, a major operation was undertaken by the Spanish
National Police to tackle a human trafficking gang that focussed on bringing illegal
Albanian immigrants to the UK. Almost 180
victims (14 of which were children) were identified, and 72 arrests were made across five
countries.

(the Russian Federation) to Lithuania without any signs of excise duty stamps were still
reported by Lithuania.
Illicit cigarettes hidden in various parts of vehicles were the most detected.
The use of double bottom constructions, in
turn, still seemed to be less frequent though
included larger amounts of illicit goods. In July,
Belarusian border guards, as an example, revealed over 26 000 packs of cigarettes ‘Fest’
originating from Belarus hidden in a cargo
compartment below the floor of a semitrailer en route to Poland.

Figure 27. 122 boxes hidden in a cargo of
timber exiting Belarus

As to green border sections, cardboard boxes
wrapped in black plastic were often left by
criminal groups in forests or on river banks.
Frequently, these illicit goods are picked up
by foot and further transported by a van or
off-road quad bikes.
Off-road vehicles often facilitate the transport of illicit cigarettes to and from the vicinity of the green border or river banks. In
September, the Lithuanian authorities reported about 37 000 packets of cigarettes
found inside a UAZ abandoned in the forest near the border with Belarus. Moreover,
a case of an abandoned quad bikes without registration plate, as well as 500 packets of cigarettes with stamps from Belarus,
left nearby seemed to confirm this modus operandi. It is highly probably that the off-road
vehicles had been left in the forest in preparation for the further transportation of illicit cigarettes.

In August, the same amount of cigarettes
was detected by Polish border guards in a
Volkswagen van at the Ukrainian-Polish border. As a result of a thorough inspection hidden caches designated for goods’ smuggling
were found not only in the floor of the vehicle but also in the walls. The packs had
neither Ukrainian nor Polish excise stamps,
which suggests that they originated from illegal sources of production.

Drug trafficking to Western Europe

© igcprofesional.org

In Q3 2014, similar trends in drug trafficking
across the EU external borders to Western
European countries were seen as in Q2. Cocaine accounted for a large majority of the
seizures in Western Europe, and as before,
Spain and the Netherlands saw the largest
hauls of this narcotic drug. In one such instance, eight hundred kilos of cocaine were
seized off the coast of Vigo, Spain. The drugs

Polish authorities seized 10 kg of marijuana in Poland near the border with Lithuania. Narcotics were wrapped in 30 compressed bundles packed hermetically and submerged in the diesel fuel tank of a car with German registration plates, preceded by a
motorbike with Russian registration plates. The drivers appeared to be Russian citizens.

were found on a 16-metre luxury yacht which
was often rented out as a cruise ship for up
to eight passengers. A similar example can
be seen in the case study box, with EUR 80
million worth of cocaine being smuggled to
Ireland on a luxury yacht.
This follows a trend of luxury yachts being
used as trafficking vehicles in the Atlantic,
in which drugs are loaded at high seas from
another long range vessel and then brought
on board the yacht to ports along the western coast of the EU.
As in Q3, large quantities of hashish were detected crossing from Morocco to Spain, with
a number of seizures weighing nearly a metric ton (992 kg in one particular case) being
detected. Compared to Q2, many of these
larger loads were being smuggled to Spain
by sea on mostly luxury yachts (as with cocaine), which, as mentioned before, is probably due to improved weather conditions. Also
several large quantities of amphetamines
were seized, including an incredible 114 kg of
amphetamine sulphate (often called Speed)
which seems to have been smuggled from
Columbia and was seized in Spain.
Drug trafficking in the Balkans
In South/South-Eastern Europe, Bulgaria
seized a significant amount of heroin coming
from Turkey, with more seized this year than
in the previous 10 years. This was mostly due
to one very large detection of 198 kg which
was hidden in a lorry compartment, whilst
other detections were of between 10–30 kg.

80 million Euro cocaine seizure off Cork, Ireland
Cocaine worth an estimated EUR 80 million was seized in
an Irish joint operation against drug trafficking. The cocaine
being transported by luxury yacht was intercepted roughly
200 miles off the coast of Cork, Ireland. The vessel is thought
to have departed from Venezuela and was destined for the
UK. This follows a commonly seen modus operandi of large
quantities of cocaine being transported by luxury yacht
towards the UK.
Source: Irish Mirror, 24 September 2014

Truck carrying 330 kg of heroin seized in Germany
A shipment of heroin worth roughly EUR 50 million was seized
near the north-western city of Essen in Germany. This is of
particular note, as it shows that a singular shipment of heroin can contain more than the combined total of all heroin
detected at the eastern borders. It should be noted however, that this is also a very unusual modus operandi as the
risk of the lorry being detected usually drives traffickers to
split the heroin into smaller consignments.
330 kilograms of heroin were found in a lorry that had been
transporting pickled cucumbers and garlic from Iran. The
news agency DW reported that the seizure exceeded the
total amount of heroin seized in Germany in 2013, which
was roughly 270 kilograms.

4.9.4. Vehicle theft

Smuggling of illicit drugs at the eastern
borders

Exit of stolen motor vehicles

The third quarter of 2014 was marked in
September by significant seizures of hashish smuggled from Poland to Belarus. Two
major trafficking cases led to the seizure of
a total amount of around 190 kg of hashish.

In the third quarter of 2014 the number of
detected vehicles reported through Frontex
Joint Operations slightly decreased compared
to the previous quarter. 79 stolen vehicles
have been prevented from crossing the bor-

45 of 62

Frontex · FRAN Quarterly · q3 2014

der in Q3 2014. However, detections at the EU
external borders reported to Frontex represented only a small share of the vehicles reportedly stolen in the EU.
According to JO Focal Points Land, similarly
to the previous quarter, the Polish-Ukrainian border section was the most affected by
the phenomenon of stolen vehicle smuggling,
followed by the Polish border with Belarus,
Hungarian border with Ukraine and Romanian border with Moldova.
The detected vehicles reportedly originated
from different EU Member States such as:
Poland, Italy, Germany, Austria, Belgium, the
Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden. Mercedes, Volkswagen, Audi and BMW were
the top four most trafficked makes. A high
proportion of the smuggled Mercedes were
Sprinter vans. Most persons driving the stolen vehicles on exit from the EU were citizens of Ukraine, Belarus, Romania, Poland,
the Russian Federation or Moldova.
Most car thefts were detected by queries to
the SIS II, INTERPOL and national theft databases with help of the Vehicle Identification
Number (VIN) specified on the engine, frame
and major parts of most motor vehicles.
Interestingly, among stolen cars, lorries or
motorbikes, cases of stolen bicycles and agricultural or construction vehicles were frequently reported. Apparently, the summer
season affected the popularity of these stolen vehicles due to increasing demand on the
eastern markets.

4.10. Passenger flow
Since January 2014, Member States have been
invited to regularly report on passenger flows
at their external borders under FRAN. Their
reporting is not yet comprehensive and thus
it is not yet possible to have an EU-wide
overview of passenger flow across the ex-

46 of 62

ternal borders at the EU level. Nevertheless,
some limited analyses are possible and presented here.
For most Member States, whether at the air
borders or at the land borders, passenger flow
peaked in August, corresponding to the peak
of the holiday seasons. Passenger flow already
considerably decreased by September. Nevertheless, for most Member States, Q3 has
been the busiest of the year. Most travellers
are believed to be EU citizens, thus only requiring minimum checks on entry.
4.10.1. At the air borders
At the air borders, one of the main difficulties for most Schengen Member States is to
distinguish between the flow of passengers
entering from third-countries and those entering from a non-Schengen Member States.
Some Member States merged both flows,
while others reported only arrivals from
third-countries.
In Q3, 13 Member States (compared to 15 for
Q2 2014, as France and Belgium reported only
on two months) reported entries from thirdcountries and non-Schengen Member States
for all three months, summing up more than
17 million passenger arrivals. This was an increase of about 11% compared to Q2, but an
increase of 60% compared to Q1. This highlights the huge variations in the volume of
border checks between the beginning of the
year and the peak holiday season.
4.10.2. At the land border
At the land border, data on passengers arriving from third-countries were available
for ten Member States, totalling about 9.2
million passengers in Q3 2014. Like at the air
border, passenger flow increased between
Q2 and Q3, mostly associated with the summer season which usually shows a peak in
August. Compared to Q1, the increase at the

land border was of 39%. In contrast to this
overall trend, passenger flow at the Latvian
land borders decreased in Q3 2014.

Sources and Methods
For the data concerning detections at the external borders, some of the border types are
not applicable to all FRAN Member States.
This pertains to data on all FRAN indicators
since the data are provided disaggregated
by border type. The definitions of detections
at land borders are therefore not applicable (excluding borders with non-Schengen
principalities) for Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Iceland,
Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland and
the UK. For Cyprus, the land border refers to
the Green Line demarcation with the area
not under the effective control of the government of the Republic of Cyprus. For sea
borders, the definitions are not applicable for
land-locked Member States including Austria,
the Czech Republic, Hungary, Luxembourg,
Slovakia and Switzerland.
In addition, data on detections of illegal border-crossing at land, air and sea BCPs (1B) are
not available for Iceland, Ireland and Spain
and in Greece (these detections are included
in the data for Indicator 1A). Data for Norway only includes detections of illegal border-crossing at land and sea BCPs (1B), not
between BCPs (1A).
In Italy, detections of illegal border-crossing
at sea BCPs are only reported for intra-EU
border-crossing from Greece. Data on detections of illegal border-crossing between
sea BCPs (1A) are not available for Ireland.
Data on apprehension (FRAN Indicator 2) of
facilitators is not available for Ireland. For Italy, the data are not disaggregated by border
type, but are reported as total apprehensions (not specified). Data for Italy and Norway also include the facilitation of illegal stay
and work. For Romania, the data include
land intra-EU detections on exit at the border with Hungary.

For the data concerning detections of illegal
stay (FRAN Indicator 3), data on detections
at exit are not available for Denmark, Ireland,
Italy, Spain and the UK. Starting from January 2012, data on inland detections are not
available from the Netherlands.
Data on refusals of entry (FRAN Indicator 4)
at the external EU borders are not disaggregated by reason of refusal for Ireland and
the UK. Refusals of entry at the Spanish land
borders at Ceuta and Melilla (without the issuance of a refusal form) are reported separately and are not included in the presented
FRAN data.
The data on applications for international
protection (FRAN Indicator 5) are not disaggregated by place of application (type of
border on entry or inland applications) for
Austria, the Czech Republic and Slovenia.
For these countries, only the total number
of applications is reported. For France, only
asylum applications at the external borders
are reported, not inland applications. For the
UK, data reported for applications at air BCPs
also include applications at sea BCPs.
The data on return decisions issued (FRAN
indicator 7A) are not available for Ireland,
France, The Netherlands and Sweden. The
data on effective returns (FRAN indicator
7B) are not available for Ireland. In addition,
the data of effective returns are not disaggregated by return operation (voluntary and
forced) for Spain. The data on voluntary effective returns (FRAN Indicator 7A) are not
disaggregated by type of return operation
(IOM assisted and others) for Belgium, Czech
Republic, Finland and the Netherlands. The
data on forced effective returns (FRAN Indicator 7A) are not disaggregated by type of return operation (enforced by Member Stated
and by Joint Operations) for Belgium, Finland,
Iceland and the Netherlands.
