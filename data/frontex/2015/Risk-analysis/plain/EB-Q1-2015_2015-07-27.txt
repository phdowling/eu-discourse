Frontex official publications fall into four main categories: risk analysis, training,
operations and research, each marked with a distinct graphic identifier. Risk analysis
publications bear a triangular symbol formed by an arrow drawing a triangle, with
a dot at the centre. Metaphorically, the arrow represents the cyclical nature of risk
analysis processes and its orientation towards an appropriate operational response.
The triangle is a symbol of ideal proportions and knowledge, reflecting the pursuit
of factual exactness, truth and exhaustive analysis. The dot at the centre represents
the intelligence factor and the focal point where information from diverse sources
converges to be processed, systematised and shared as analytical products. Thus,
Frontex risk analysis is meant to be at the centre and to form a reliable basis for its
operational activities.

Introduction

Concept

Methodology

The Eastern European Borders Risk Analysis Network (EB-RAN) performs monthly
exchanges of statistical data and information on the most recent irregular migration trends. This information is compiled
at Frontex RAU level and analysed in cooperation with the regional partners on
a quarterly and annual basis. The annual
reports offer a more in-depth analysis of
the occurring developments and phenomena which impact the regional and common borders while the quarterly reports
are meant to provide regular updates and
identify emerging trends in order to maintain situational awareness. Both types of
reports are aimed at offering support for
strategic and operational decision making.

The Eastern European Borders Quarterly
statistical overview is focused on quarterly
developments for the seven key indicators
of irregular migration: (1) detections of illegal border-crossing between BCPs, (2) detections of illegal border-crossing at BCPs,
(3) refusals of entry, (4) detections of illegal stay, (5) asylum applications, (6) detections of facilitators, and (7) detections
of fraudulent documents.1
The backbone of this overview are monthly
statistics provided within the framework
of the EB-RAN (Belarus, Ukraine, and Moldova) and reference period statistics from
common border sections of the neighbouring EU Member States (Norway, Finland,

1

Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania). The data are
processed, checked for errors and merged
into an Excel database for further analysis.

Structure
The current issue of the Eastern European
Borders Quarterly is the first following
a new approach adopted for risk analysis quarterlies. The first part offers a general Situational overview broken down
by main areas of work of border-control
authorities and police activities related to
irregular migration. The second part contains more in depth Featured risk analyses of particular phenomena. The structure
of the report may still be subject to some
readjustments.

Please note that the analysis of this indicator
is now limited to EB-RAN countries
only, given that EU Member States have
transitioned to the European Union
Document-Fraud (EDF) reporting scheme.

Illegal border-crossing
During the first quarter 2015, 774 persons
were detected for illegal crossing of the
regional and common borders between
BCPs. Of this figure, 56% represented regional (CIS and EaP countries) nationals
with the highest number of Ukrainian citizens, followed by Georgians and Russians.

Facilitators
The number of detected facilitators of irregular migration increased significantly in
the first quarter of 2015 when compared
to the same quarter of 2014 (from 11 in Q1
2014 up to 52 in Q1 2015). Most detections
in the examined period were reported by
Belarus (77%) at the border with Lithuania, where the highest increase among all
common borders was observed.

Border checks

During the first quarter of 2015 there were
just four detections of clandestine entries reported at the Eastern European
borders. Reported cases included three
migrants from Afghanistan, Syria and Pakistan detected while attempting to cross
from Ukraine to Romania hiding in a lorry
(see Fig. 3), and one Russian citizen transported from Belarus to Poland in a suitcase (see Fig. 4).

Figure 3. Three irregular migrants from
Pakistan, Afghanistan and Syria detected
hiding in a cargo trailer in an attempt to
cross illegally the Romanian-Ukrainian
border at the BCP Porubne

Refusals of entry
The number of refusals of entry issued during the first quarter 2015 at the common
and regional borders decreased by almost
9% when compared to the fourth quarter
of 2014 (from 22 380 to 20 425). Compared
to the corresponding quarter of 2014, the
numbers remained relatively stable.
The majority of refusals of entry was reported at the land borders (90%), while the
remaining 10% was issued at air (6%) and
sea borders (4%). The highest number of
refusals was issued by Ukraine, Poland and
Belarus. However, an increasing trend of

10 of 22

refusals of entry was observed in Ukraine,
while Poland and Belarus reported a drop.
Top five refused nationalities were citizens
of Ukraine, the Russian Federation, Uzbekistan, Moldova and Tajikistan.
The most significant drop in Q1 2015 referred to Georgians and Russians recorded
by Poland, while the most remarkable increases were related to citizens of Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Azerbaijan and
Armenia refused entry to Ukraine.
The increasing outflow of Central Asian
nationals from the Russian Federation
can be explained by the current economic
situation and the more restrictive migration policy. The deteriorating economic
standing and rouble depreciation rendered
working in the Russian Federation unprofitable, with migrants’ wages almost halved
and remittances send back home diminished. The outflow of labour migrants is
also associated with new rules that came
into effect on 1 January abolishing the former quota system and requiring migrant
workers from outside the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) (apart from the Russian Federation including Armenia, Belarus
and Kazakhstan) to obtain work permits.
Moreover, the new rules require migrants
to pass Russian language and history tests,
buy health insurance, and pay higher fees
for work permits. In addition, citizens of
non-EEU countries can no longer travel
to the Russian Federation using domestic
ID cards. Instead, they are required to use
international passports, which are more
expensive to obtain for labour migrants.

first quarter 2015 when compared to the
fourth quarter of 2014 (up from 72 in Q4
2014 to 78 in Q1 2015). Most detections
were reported by Ukraine at air borders
and at the land borders with Moldova and
the Russian Federation.
As regards nationalities, Moldovans (mainly
detected at the Moldovan-Ukrainian border section) ranked first among fraudulent document users, followed by Syrians
(mainly on Moldova-Ukraine flights) and
Ukrainians. The majority of commonly
used fraudulent documents reported by
EB-RAN countries were passports (78%)
and ID cards (3.8%) and visas (3.8%).

Illegal stay in EB-RAN
countries
There were 5 732 detections of illegal stay
in the first quarter of 2015 reported by the
three EB-RAN countries, which represents
over an 8.5% decrease when compared to

the previous quarter, and remained roughly
similar in relation to the same quarter of
2014 (down from 5 896).
With regards to the top five nationalities,
Russians, Ukrainians, Georgians, Moldovans and Azeris were most detected for

illegal stay in EB-RAN countries. While
citizens of the Russian Federation, Moldova and Azerbaijan were in the majority
of cases reported by Ukraine. Ukrainians
and Georgians, in turn, were mostly detected by Belarus.

Sustained irregular migration
movements by regional (CIS and EaP
country) nationals
The common eastern
European borders
In Q1 2015, regional migrants continued
to abuse legal travel channels to enter
the EU rather than attempt illegal entry
via the green border. Regional (CIS and
EaP country) nationals accounted for almost 85% of the 10 076 refusals of entry
issued at the EU’s common eastern borders, but only for 38% of detected illegal
entries between BCPs.
During the first quarter 2015, there were
less regional migrants reported both under the refusals of entry as well as illegal
border-crossings to the EU, diminishing
the pressure on the EU eastern borders.
Nevertheless, the Ukrainian crisis and difficult economic situation in Ukraine continued to increase the flow of Ukrainian
nationals towards the EU in the analysed
quarter.
As regards nationalities, refusals issued
to Russians, Belarusians, Georgians and

Armenians decreased significantly, while
refusals issued to Ukrainians increased,
sustaining at the same time, the movements of regional migrants as a total towards the EU.
The most remarkable drop in refusals of
entry was observed among Georgians
(1 878 in Q4 2014 to 96 in Q1 2015) and Russians (1 248 in Q4 2014 to 435 in Q1 2015).
By contrast, Ukrainian nationals were refused entry to the EU in Q1 2015 slightly
more frequently (6 095) than in the previous quarter (5 384).

Inside the EU/ Schengen area
Asylum application of regional
nationals
The number of asylum applications lodged
by the CIS and EaP nationals (regional migrants) in the EU/Schengen Associated
Countries decreased of 8.8% in analysed
period, when compared with the previous quarter. This figure was still on a relatively low level (over 11 200) taking into

account increasing trend of asylum applications filed by all nationals in the EU/
Schengen Associated Countries in the first
quarter 2015 (over 181 500).
Main applications’ receivers of the regional migrants were Germany, Poland,
Italy, Sweden and Austria, with Ukrainians as dominating nationals, followed by
Georgians and Russians. Nevertheless, the
trends for different nationalities diverged
strongly in particular top five EU countries,
e.g. Russian and Georgian applicants increased in Germany, and decreased in Poland, Sweden and Austria, while Ukrainians
applied less frequently for asylum in Germany and Sweden in favour for Poland, Italy and Austria.
Illegal stay by regional migrants (CIS
and EaP nationals)
During the first quarter 2015 there were
10 070 illegal stayers from the CIS and EaP
countries reported in EU Member States/
Schengen Associated Countries, out of
which 7 581 of the Ukrainians, Russians and

the total, followed by Russians and Georgians with 19.5% and 11%, respectively.
Poland, Germany and Sweden recorded the
highest number of illegal stayers originating from Ukraine, Georgia and the Russian
Federation. As in case of asylum applications Poland faced the highest number of
Ukrainians detected for illegal stay. Russians targeted especially Germany and Poland to the lesser extent, while Georgians
were mainly reported by Greece, Sweden
and Germany.

countries

uments being in possession of Ukrainians
represented Romanian travel documents.

During the analysed period, there were
264 citizens of CIS and EaP countries reported with fraudulent documents on intra EU/Schengen travels. The most cases
were reported by the UK and Italy.

Outlook

As regards nationalities, the great majority
of fraudulent document users recorded on
intra EU/Schengen travels were Ukrainians, accounting for over 80% of all cases
reported in the first quarter 2015. Around
half of fraudulent documents presented
by Ukrainian nationals was represented
by Polish ID cards mostly belonging to
other persons (imposters). The second

A significant drop of Russians, Belarusians,
Tajiks, Kirgiz and Armenians refused entry
(mostly to Poland) as well as a decrease
in the number of Georgian and Russian
nationals applying for asylum (mostly in
Poland) indicates that the flow of these
migrants towards the EU will continue at
a lower level also in the coming quarter.
However, as the situation in the eastern
Ukraine remains uncertain, further increase in the Ukrainian flow towards the
EU, accompanied by more cases of the
abuse of legal travel channels, cannot be
ruled out.

Tobacco products

Q1 2015 was marked by seizures of significant amounts of illicit cigarettes most
often smuggled on cargo trains or transported across border rivers. The typical places for illegal transport of tobacco
goods did not change; however, cigarettes
smuggled concealed in fuel tanks were increasingly detected.

Figure 6. 187 500 packs of cigarettes

border with Lithuania detected by the

In another remarkable case of illicit cigarette smuggling in Q1 2015, over 17 000
packs of cigarettes were detected in a
truck-load of pallets of wood by Ukrainian border guards at the BCP Krakovets
at the Ukrainian-Polish border. In-depth
inspection revealed that cigarettes were
cleverly camouflaged as pieces of wood
(see Fig. 8).

Stolen motor vehicles
Smuggling of stolen vehicles from the EU
via its eastern borders continued in Q1
2015. Mercedes, Volkswagen, Audi, BMW
and Toyota were the top five most trafficked makes, while the persons driving
stolen vehicles were mostly citizens of

the Russian Federation, Belarus, Lithuania, Moldova, Romania, Poland and Kazakhstan. The detected vehicles had been
stolen in different EU Member States, such
as Poland, Italy, Germany, Austria, Belgium,
the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden.
Car thieves applied various modi operandi
to conceal the identity of stolen vehicles at
the external borders, for example the manipulation of the VIN. In many cases, irregularities in car registration certificates or
insurance policies were reported, as well
as counterfeit powers of attorney authorising the driver to travel abroad.
Importantly, the first quarter of 2015 saw
a new phenomenon: stolen cars were also
detected on entry to the EU via the common borders, mostly from Belarus. The vehicles, not only luxury cars, were reported

The largest shipment of illicit cigarettes
was revealed by Belarusian border guards
in February 2015. 187 500 packs of cigarettes were detected being rafted on the
Neman River, on the border with Lithuania. The market value of the cigarettes
was estimated at RUB 1 billion 237.5 million.

One of the most sophisticated modi operandi revealed in Q1 2015 was identified by
the State Border Service of Ukraine, which
prevented the smuggling of large quantities of tobacco products through the BCP
Yagodyn-Dorohusk at the Ukrainian-Polish border section in March. A joint border and customs inspection of a 27-tonne
shipment of timber logs revealed that 55 of
them had cavities containing caches filled
with tobacco products. Overall, 25 000
packs of ‘Fest’ cigarettes of Belarusian
production with no excise stamps were
discovered (see Fig. 7).

Illicit drugs and prohibited
substances
In contrast to the last quarter of 2014, Q1
2015 was marked by relatively few seizures
of drugs, especially hashish.
For example, an attempt of hashish smuggling was revealed by the Polish border
guards at the BCP Korczowa in the direction to Ukraine. 31.5 kg of drugs, worth
around PLN 880 800, were packed in 34
plastic bags and hidden in the body of a
Renault with French registration plates.
Hashish was smuggled by citizens of Portugal. Interestingly, the same modus operandi was observed in the final quarter of
2014, in September, when another citizen
of Portugal attempted to smuggle 54 kg
of hashish in a similar way, also at the BCP
Korczowa.

Importantly, the first quarter of 2015
brought an increase in detections of medical pills containing substances whose importation into Belarus is banned. A number
of such cases were detected at the BCP
Brest on the Polish-Belarusian border and
involving Russian citizens of Chechen origin legally residing in EU countries. They
typically travelled in luxury passenger cars
(Lexus, Mercedes, Chrysler, VW) registered
in France, Belgium or Spain.

Outlook
The continuous smuggling of excise goods
through the common borders can be explained by large differences in their prices
between EU countries and their eastern
neighbours, which constitute a major incentive. It can be assessed that this will
not change significantly in the foreseeable future, considering the weak economic
situation in Ukraine and the Russian Federation. On the contrary, smuggling may
even intensify if the profitability increases
in the coming quarters.
