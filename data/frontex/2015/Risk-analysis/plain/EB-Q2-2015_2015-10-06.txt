Frontex official publications fall into four main categories: risk analysis, training,
operations and research, each marked with a distinct graphic identifier. Risk analysis
publications bear a triangular symbol formed by an arrow drawing a triangle, with
a dot at the centre. Metaphorically, the arrow represents the cyclical nature of risk
analysis processes and its orientation towards an appropriate operational response.
The triangle is a symbol of ideal proportions and knowledge, reflecting the pursuit
of factual exactness, truth and exhaustive analysis. The dot at the centre represents
the intelligence factor and the focal point where information from diverse sources
converges to be processed, systematised and shared as analytical products. Thus,
Frontex risk analysis is meant to be at the centre and to form a reliable basis for its
operational activities.

Introduction

Concept

Methodology

The Eastern European Borders Risk Analysis Network (EB-RAN) performs monthly
exchanges of statistical data and information on the most recent irregular migration trends. This information is compiled
at the level of the Frontex Risk Analysis
Unit (RAU) and analysed in cooperation
with the regional partners on a quarterly
and annual basis. The annual reports offer a more in-depth analysis of the occurring developments and phenomena which
impact the regional and common borders while the quarterly reports are meant
to provide regular updates and identify
emerging trends in order to maintain situational awareness. Both types of reports
are aimed at offering support for strategic
and operational decision making.

The Eastern European Borders Quarterly
statistical overview is focused on quarterly
developments for the seven key indicators
of irregular migration: (1) detections of illegal border-crossing between BCPs, (2) detections of illegal border-crossing at BCPs,
(3) refusals of entry, (4) detections of illegal stay, (5) asylum applications, (6) detections of facilitators, and (7) detections
of fraudulent documents.1
The backbone of this overview are monthly
statistics provided within the framework
of the EB-RAN (Belarus, Ukraine, and Moldova) and reference period statistics from
common border sections of the neighbouring EU Member States (Norway, Finland,

1

Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania). The data are
processed, checked for errors and merged
into an Excel database for further analysis.

Structure
The first part offers a general Situational
overview broken down by main areas of
work of border-control authorities and police activities related to irregular migration.
The second part contains more in-depth
Featured risk analyses of particular phenomena. As the current issue of the Eastern
European Borders Quarterly is the second following a new approach adopted
for risk analysis quarterlies, the structure
of the report may still be subject to some
readjustments.

Please note that the analysis of this indicator
is now limited to EB-RAN countries
only, given that EU Member States have
transitioned to the European Union
Document-Fraud (EDF) reporting scheme.

Border surveillance

Illegal border-crossing
During the second quarter of 2015, 1 411
persons were detected for illegal crossing of the regional and common borders
between BCPs. Almost half (47%) were
regional nationals (of CIS and EaP countries), mostly Ukrainians, Georgians and
Moldovans.

Figure 3. Detections between BCPs at the common borders and EU Member States’
land borders with the Russian Federation (data only from EU side) show that the
pressure in Q2 2015 as compared to the same quarter last year was the highest at the

Border checks
Clandestine entries
In the second quarter of 2015 there was
only one clandestine entry attempt reported at the eastern European borders.
It involved a Moldovan national detected
by Romania at its border with Moldova.

Refusals of entry
The number of refusals of entry reported
during the second quarter of 2015 at the
common and regional borders increased
by 23% when compared to the first quarter of 2015 and by 17% in relation to the
same period last year.
Similarly to the previous quarter, the majority of refusals was reported at land borders
(88%), while the remaining 12% – at air and
sea borders. The highest number of refusals
was issued by Ukraine, Poland and Belarus.

The top five refused nationalities, as in
the first quarter of 2015, were citizens of
Ukraine, the Russian Federation, Moldova,
Uzbekistan and Tajikistan.
Ukraine mostly refused entry to Russians,
Uzbeks and Tajiks, while Poland and Belarus – to Ukrainians.

Document fraud
In the second quarter of 2015 detections
of persons using fraudulent documents
reported by the three EB-RAN countries
(Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine) increased
by 68% when compared to the first quarter of 2015. Higher figures were observed
mostly in Ukraine, which reported 83%
more document fraud cases.

fraudulent document users followed by
Ukrainians and Armenians. The vast majority of commonly used fraudulent documents were Moldovan passports, while
visas accounted for only 10% of fraudulent
documents reported by EB-RAN countries.
It is worth mentioning that similarly to the
previous quarter, an ongoing phenomenon
of visa fraud among non-regional migrants
was reported by EU Member States in Q2
2015. Apart from cases of visa applications
made under false pretences detected in
migrants’ countries of origin, an increasing number of such attempts is observed
in the transiting countries (e.g. Ukraine,
Belarus and the Russian Federation).

With regards to nationalities, Moldovans
were the most frequently detected among

VIS launched in Ukraine and other Eastern Partnership countries
As part of the worldwide introduction of the Visa Information System (VIS),
the Schengen States launched the VIS in Ukraine (and in other Eastern Partnership countries) on 23 June 2015. It has been already introduced in Africa,
the Middle East, the Americas, Australasia, South-East Asia, Central Asia,
Western Balkans and Turkey. By the end of November 2015 all Schengen
consulates worldwide will be connected to the VIS.

Situation in the Eastern European region

Illegal stay in EB-RAN countries
In the second quarter of 2015 there were
6 445 detections of illegal stay reported by
the three EB-RAN countries, which represents an increase of 12% when compared
to the first quarter of 2015 a 61% rise in relation to the same quarter of 2014.
Similarly to the previous quarter, the
top five nationalities detected for illegal
stay in EB-RAN countries were Russians,
Ukrainians, Georgians, Moldovans and Azeris. Citizens of the Russian Federation
and Azerbaijan were mostly detected by
Ukraine, while Ukrainians, Georgians and

Moldovans were by and large reported
by Belarus.
Almost 99% of detections of illegal stay
was reported on exit, out of which 53% of
cases were recorded by Ukraine and 41%
– by Belarus. The Ukrainian border with
the Russian Federation and Belarus were
the most affected ones, followed by Belarusian and Ukrainian airports.
In order to prevent and combat illegal activities related to smuggling of irregular
migrants, the State Border Guard Service

of Ukraine came up with the initiative to
launch the operation ‘Frontier-2015’ on 15
June 2015. The operation was also meant to
improve collaboration in combating irregular migration at interdepartmental, interagency and international levels. In general,
according to open sources, during the first
week of the operation ‘Frontier-2015’ 50
irregular migrants were detected. In addition, measures are being taken to identify offenders involved in the facilitation of
irregular migrants’ movements and stay.

Operation ‘Frontier-2015’
On 15 June 2015, the joint operation ‘Frontier-2015’ was launched at the initiative and under coordination of the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine,
in close cooperation with the Interior Ministry, Security Service, State Migration Service and State Fiscal Service of Ukraine as well as neighbouring
EU countries’ border authorities.
‘Frontier-2015’ has the status of a national and long-term operation to combat irregular migration and human trafficking. The main objective of the operation is to check the most frequent places of stay of irregular migrants
and identify the routes of their movement and existing channels of irregular migration flows on the territory of Ukraine.
The operation should help to reduce illegal activities connected with facilitation networks smuggling irregular migrants and to improve interaction
in combating irregular migration at interdepartmental, interagency and
international levels.

Abuse of legal travel channels on the
way to the EU

Figure 5. In contrast to a low number of illegal border-crossings between BCPs
made by Ukrainian nationals at the eastern European borders, refusals of entry to
Ukrainians accounted over 60% of the total issued by EU Member States/Schengen
Associated Countries in Q2 2015
Ukrainian nationals reported at the common borders under indicators of illegal border-crossing between BCPs,
illegal stay and refusals of entry

In Q2 2015 there were 163 Ukrainians detected for illegal border-crossing; however, only nine cases of Ukrainian citizens
were reportedly linked with irregular migration, while 55% was connected with
smuggling and 39% with other reasons.
When compared to Q1 2015, the number of detected cases related to irregular
migration of Ukrainians was at a similar
level, while the cases linked to smuggling
and other reasons were on an increase.
In contrast to the low number Ukrainian
nationals detected at the eastern European borders for illegal border-crossing
between BCPs, refusals of entry to Ukrainians accounted for over 60% of the total
issued by the EU countries along the eastern EU borders (5 806 out of 9 284). The
vast majority of Ukrainians (84%) were refused entry to Poland.
Importantly, to counter visa abuse, it was
necessary to implement new measures,
including legislation amendments and
ICT solutions. The latest adjustments expected to influence future irregular migration flows from Ukraine include:

On 23 June 2015, the Visa Information System (VIS) was launched by the Schengen
States in Ukraine (and in other Eastern
Partnership countries). The major change
for Ukrainian citizens from 23 June 2015 is
that all applicants need to appear in person in order to provide biometric data (fingerprints and a digital photograph) in the
case of applications for short-term Schengen visas (max. 90 days in 180 days). Fingerprints can be then copied from the first

eb-ran · q2 2015

The VIS implementation will better protect applicants against identity theft and
prevent document fraud and visa shopping. The use of biometric data to confirm the visa holder’s identity will also
result in more accurate, faster and more
secure checks.
Possible unlawful use of Ukrainian
passports
On the internet, there are dozens of advertisements offering original Ukrainian
documents for sale (see examples in the
box). Some Ukrainian citizens planning to
move abroad or already living in another
country sell their passports, identification
numbers and even birth certificates. A full
set of such documents can be bought for
around USD 2 200, and the passport alone
for USD 1 000. According to open sources,
the Ukrainian internet is flooded with this
kind of advertisements.
Passports, together with large amounts
of money, are also transported through
the separation line between the Ukrainian-controlled and uncontrolled areas of
Donbas. In May 2015, for example, in the
Donetsk region State Border Guard Service employees, serving at one of the temporary checkpoints, stopped a Ukrainian
citizen driving a car. Upon control, ten
passports of other persons, 75 cards of
several banks and cash in the amount of
USD 155 400 were found in the car.
Importantly, not only civilians are involved
in passport selling. According to a statement made by the Ukrainian Prosecutor
General’s Office on 25 May 2015, a range of

Extra import taxes triggers growth of smuggling in Ukraine
An additional import duty on goods was introduced in Ukraine starting from
1 January 2015. Extra import charges on 100 commodity groups (at a rate of
5–10%) were intended to increase the budget revenues by UAH 17.6 billion.
The decision on the introduction of extra duties was temporary (12 months)
and was considered as a justifiable measure in the difficult economic situation. So far, it has not brought expected effects. According to Deputy Chairman of the State Fiscal Service, additional import duties have provoked
an increase in smuggling across the Ukrainian border. Moreover, an additional tax burden pushed entrepreneurs towards using various tax evasion
schemes when importing goods to the country.

illegal activities and corruption cases had
been disclosed among Ukrainian officials
of the armed forces, other military units
and law-enforcement agencies involved in
anti-terrorist operations in Donetsk and
Luhansk, as well as local officials.

For example, during a three-day operation
of the Security Service of Ukraine run in
May 2015, military prosecutors arrested
the Head of the Migration Service in an
undisclosed city in the Donetsk Oblast
