Frontex official publications fall into four main categories: risk analysis, training, operations and
research, each marked with a distinct graphic identifier. Risk analysis publications bear a triangular symbol formed by an arrow drawing a triangle, with a dot at the centre. Metaphorically,
the arrow represents the cyclical nature of risk analysis processes and its orientation towards an
appropriate operational response. The triangle is a symbol of ideal proportions and knowledge,
reflecting the pursuit of factual exactness, truth and exhaustive analysis. The dot at the centre
represents the intelligence factor and the focal point where information from diverse sources
converges to be processed, systematised and shared as analytical products. Thus, Frontex risk
analysis is meant to be at the centre and to form a reliable basis for its operational activities.

Executive summary
New and unprecedented high numbers were
reported across several indicators used to
measure regional irregular migration risks
during 2014. For example, there were more
than 66 000 detections of illegal bordercrossing at regional and common green borders, a number 65% higher compared to 2013.
Over two-thirds of all these detections occurred at one border section only: the Hungarian-Serbian, mostly in the period between
July and December 2014. At one point during December 2014, this border section
accounted for over half of all illegal bordercrossings at the external borders of the EU
(a 55% share).
As a region surrounded by EU Member States,
the Western Balkans continued to be largely
a transit area for irregular migratory flows
between different EU Member States and
Schengen Associated Countries.
Compared to 2013, detections of transiting non-European irregular migrants increased by 35%, while significant differences
also emerged in terms of countries of origin. Namely, the region saw a sharp decline
in the number of migrants from North and
West Africa (-90% and -71%, respectively) and
also from Pakistan (-89%). At the same time
sharp increases were registered with regard
to citizens of Syria and Afghanistan (+363%
and +168%, respectively).
The Western Balkans also increased its importance as a source region during 2014 with
over 36 000 reported detections of illegal
border-crossing by local inhabitants. It has
to be stressed that although the number
roughly doubled compared to 2013 it still re-

mained below the levels observed prior to
visa liberalisation in 2009.
Two groups of migrants stood out in this
respect: nationals of Kosovo* and Albania,
whose numbers increased across all indicators used to measure irregular migration
developments. As was the case in previous
years, Albanian migrants were mainly detected in the south of the region as part of
the circular migration to Greece and, to a
lesser extent, at other regional border sections while nationals of Kosovo* were by
and large detected at the Hungarian-Serbian border.

* This designation is
without prejudice to
positions on status, and is
in line with UNSCR 1244
and the ICJ Opinion on
the Kosovo declaration of
independence.

The most notable group contributing to the
status of the Western Balkans as source region were the persons coming from the territory of Kosovo.* Their numbers registered
the most prominent increase over the entire range of nationalities detected for illegal
border-crossing, especially during the second
half of 2014. In fact, in 2014 there were almost
four times as many illegal border-crossings
by Kosovo* citizens (+268%) and over twice
as many Kosovo* asylum seekers (33 400, or
134% more) as in 2013.
This development was largely driven by regional factors such as changes in asylum
policy of Hungary and also by rumours of a
prosperous life awaiting every migrant entering the EU, which were circulating amongst
the Kosovo* population. As such, the influx
from Kosovo* began to increase after Hungary started accommodating family units requesting asylum in open centres.
The second most important group were Albanians, whose numbers notably increased
across various indicators, including a 16% rise

5 of 52

Frontex · Western Balkans Annual Risk Analysis 2015

in reported illegal border-crossings, a 25%
rise in illegal stay detected in the EU, and a
144% increase in the number of submitted
asylum applications in the EU. Furthermore,
Albanians ranked second among nationalities detected for document fraud in the EU,
only outpaced by Syrians. Roughly 14% of all
detections of document fraudsters or 3 200
cases of all travel types during 2014 were
linked to Albanians. Other Western Balkan
nationalities were detected in significantly
lower numbers by comparison.
In keeping with the notion of unprecedented
highs, abuse of visa-free travel through subsequent unfounded asylum application in the
EU increased by 47% compared to the already
high levels of 2013. Namely, nationals of the
five visa-exempt Western Balkan countries
submitted over 48 000 asylum applications
in EU Member States and Schengen Associated Countries during 2014, which accounts
for a 9% share of the overall asylum intake
at EU level.
Almost 77% of the claims were submitted
in Germany alone while Serbians continued
to account for a significant 43% share of the
overall five visa-exempt nationals applying
for asylum at EU level.
Asylum applications from the five Western
Balkan countries continued to represent a

6 of 52

staggering 97% share of the total asylum intake for all visa-free countries. For comparison, nationals of El Salvador only accounted
for 0.6% of all asylum claims made in 2014.
However, comparative analysis of regular passenger flow at Serbia’s borders with Hungary
and Croatia, refusals of entry issued to Serbians and asylum abuse in the EU by these
nationals demonstrated that visa-free travel
option is still mostly used by bona fide travellers for the intended purposes. Namely, there
were more than 5 million Serbian citizens
exiting Serbia towards Hungary and Croatia compared to the roughly 21 000 asylum
applications submitted by this nationality at
EU level in 2014.
Cross-border criminality, mainly related to the
trafficking of stolen vehicles and the smuggling of illicit drugs and weapons, remains a
sizable threat to border security in the Western Balkans.
All Western Balkan countries and neighbouring EU Member States continued to implement measures to prevent visa liberalisation
abuse. Available data show that in the case
of nationals from Albania and the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, refusals of
exit prevented an even larger asylum intake
during 2014.

1. Introduction
As was the case with the previous four issues, the current edition of the Western Balkans Annual Risk Analysis (WB-ARA) 2015
has been prepared in cooperation between
the Risk Analysis Units of the competent
border-control authorities of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYR Macedonia),
Montenegro, Serbia and the Frontex Risk
Analysis Unit. In addition, the current report
was prepared with the support of the competent border-control authorities of Kosovo.*
The joint analytical activity is an integral
part of the Western Balkans Risk Analysis
Network (WB-RAN) in which all the mentioned Western Balkan countries actively
participate.
WB-RAN was established following the proposal made by Frontex in May 2009.
The WB-ARA 2015 builds on knowledge from
previous editions of the annual report, re-

porting provided by WB-RAN throughout
2014 and other privileged reporting available to Frontex.
The WB-ARA 2015 is structured around the
following elements: (1) a description of the
general context in which border controls at
common borders occur; (2) annual risk assessment that includes identification and
detailed description of the main risks affecting both the area of the Western Balkans
and EU Member States or Schengen Associated Countries; and (3) the statistical annex
of the WB-ARA 2015 includes summary tables, describing the key indicators of irregular migration in detail.

* This designation is
without prejudice to
positions on status, and is
in line with UNSCR 1244
and the ICJ Opinion on
the Kosovo declaration of
independence.

The Frontex Risk Analysis Unit would like to
thank all WB-RAN members, EU Member
States and Schengen Associated Countries
for their commitment and active engagement with the joint analytical work throughout 2014.

2. Methodology
The core of monthly statistical data from
WB-RAN and neighbouring EU Member
States (only common borders) is focused on
six key indicators of illegal migration: (1) detections of illegal border-crossing; (2) detections of facilitators; (3) detections of illegal
stay; (4) refusals of entry; (5) asylum applications; and (6) detections of false documents.
In addition to this core data set, other available to Frontex were also used. Those include
data from the European Document Fraud Risk
Analysis Network (EDF), Turkey-Frontex Risk
Analysis Network (TU-RAN) and reporting
from different Join Operations coordinated by
Frontex. Importantly, in line with agreement
by all WB-RAN members, Kosovo Border Police was invited to participate in the work of
the network (starting from 2014).
Many other qualitative and quantitative
sources were also used, in particular, bimonthly and quarterly analytical reports of
both EU Member States and WB-RAN countries, Frontex reporting in the context of the
post visa-liberalisation monitoring mechanism and analysis from Frontex Annual Risk
Analysis (ARA 2015).
Furthermore, all WB-RAN countries have
contributed additional information and
graphical material following the 2014 Annual Analytical Review meeting that was
held in Warsaw.
Open sources of information were also used.
Among others, these sources included reports
issued by government agencies, EU institutions and international or non-governmental
organisations. Additional input was provided
by both EU Member States/Schengen Associated Countries and WB-RAN countries dur-

8 of 52

ing the Western Balkans Expert meeting on
11 March 2015.

2.1. Quality of available data
Consistent with other law-enforcement indicators, variation in administrative data related
to border control depends on several factors.
In this case, the number of detections of illegal border-crossing and refusals of entry are
both functions of the amount of effort spent
detecting migrants and the flow of irregular migrants. For example, increased detections of illegal border-crossing might be due
to an actual increase in the flow of irregular
migrants, or they may in fact be an outcome
of more resources made available to detect
migrants. In exceptional cases, an influx of resources may produce an increase in reported
detections while effectively masking the actual decrease in the flow of migrants, resulting from a strong deterrent effect.

2.2.	Changes in data scope after
Croatia’s entry to the EU
Important changes in the collection and use
of data for Western Balkans Quarterly were
introduced upon Croatia’s joining the EU in
July 2013. Firstly, data for Slovenia, which now
has no external borders with non-EU Western Balkan countries, has not been included
in the report since the third quarter of 2013.
Slovenian historical data were also excluded
from the tables in order to make the comparison with previous quarters analytically
meaningful.
Secondly, as the Hungarian-Croatian and Croatian-Slovenian border sections have now become internal EU-borders they are no longer
covered by this report.

Thirdly, after joining the EU, Croatian data
on illegal stay data are limited to detections
at the border. More precisely, Croatia’s illegal stay data only include cases detected on
exit, while inland detections are not included.
The analysis of the illegal stay indicator takes
this fact into consideration.

2.3.	Changes in data scope
after Kosovo’s* entry
to the WB-RAN
Starting from the first quarter of 2014 data
from Kosovo* on key indicators of irregular migration are included in the reporting,
making it possible to get a more comprehensive picture on the irregular movements in
the region. However, as there is no historical data available for Kosovo*, the new data
does in some measure impact the comparisons of the examined period with the previous quarters. When necessary for analytical
purposes, some comparisons are made excluding data from Kosovo* and this is noted
in the text.

2.4.	Application of the
Common Integrated Risk
Analysis Model (CIRAM)
In line with the previous edition of this annual report, the 2015 WB-ARA considers risk
as defined by the updated CIRAM: a function
of threat, vulnerability and impact (see Fig. 1
overleaf). Such an approach endeavours to
emphasise risk analysis as a key tool in ensuring the optimal allocation of resources
within constraints of budget, staff and efficiency of equipment.
According to the model, a ‘threat’ is a force
or pressure acting upon the external borders
that is characterised by both its magnitude
and likelihood; ‘vulnerability’ is defined as the
capacity of a system to mitigate the threat
and ‘impact’ is determined as the potential
consequences of the threat. In this way, the
structured and systematic breakdown of risk
is presented in the annual risk assessment
and conclusions chapters.

3.1. Passenger flow analysis
Serbia’s borders were by far the busiest regional borders in terms of regular passenger flow. More precisely, there were almost
54 million entries and exits recorded by the
Serbian authorities making up 42% of the regional passenger flow share. Border crossings
took place mostly at the borders with Croatia, Hungary and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The second busiest borders with 31% of the regional share of regular passenger flows were
those of Bosnia and Herzegovina, where in
particular the borders with Croatia made up
73% of the slightly more than 40 million entries and exits.
Around two-thirds of the entries and exits
at the regional level were related to passengers who were not nationals of the reporting country (the so-called foreign travellers).
There were around 420 000 more entries
(5%) by foreign travellers than exits mainly

from the direction of Croatia, with the largest
discrepancies being in July and August suggesting a largely bona fide nature of these
movements (busy holiday season).

3.1.1. Ratios between entries and exits
The ratio between entries and exits can serve
as a proxy measurement of bona fide travel
patterns, since it provides an indication of
how many persons exited a country and later
returned in a given fixed period, and hence
did not overstay their legal period of stay. Altogether, Serbian nationals made more than
11.5 million exits towards neighbouring countries in 2014, representing an increase of 7%
compared to 2013. In comparison entries back
to Serbia in 2014 numbered only 10.5 million;
however, this still represents an increase of
6.6% compared to 2013. This means that the
number of Serbian nationals crossing their
borders have grown by around 7% both upon
entry and exit, suggesting a continuing longterm trend of Serbian nationals who leave and
fail to return within a given period.
When compared to 2013 the largest percentage increase of Serbian passengers exiting
their country was towards the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (19%), nevertheless the border between these two countries

still only ranked as the fourth busiest in Serbia. In contrast, the busiest borders for Serbian nationals exiting their country were
Hungary, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Croatia. Out of these, Bosnia and Herzegovina
witnessed the largest increase in passenger flow from 2013 to 2014 (6%), whereas
Hungary and Croatia registered modest increases of around 1% each. When looking at
the number of refusals of entry issued to Serbian nationals, the figure rose in both Hungary and Croatia in absolute terms by 18%
and 35%, respectively. When looking at the
number of refusals of entry issued to Serbians as a proportion of total passenger’s exiting Serbia, there is still an increase of 17%
and 33% in Hungary and Croatia respectively
between 2013 and 2014.
3.1.2. Refusals of entry
During the analysed period there were 28 140
issued refusals of entry for nationals from
the five visa-exempt countries at EU/SACs
level which represents a 9% increase compared to 2013.
Similarly to the previous year roughly one
third of the total decisions were issued for
an existing alert in the SIS II or national systems (H), and another important share (15%)
was issued for overstaying the legal period
(F). Together these reasons fundament almost half of the total issued refusal decisions
and despite not clearly and fully displaying
the situation they can be regarded as highly
indicative of previous abuse of the visa-free
travel by the focus nationalities.
In 2014, about 2–3 people per 1 000 Serbian
passengers were refused entry to Hungary.
The highest proportion of refusals took place
in October and November, when the number
of refusals reached slightly above 3 for every
1 000 travellers. In this period the main reason for refusals of entry was the lack of appropriate documents justifying the purpose

During the rest of the year, most refusals of
entry were issued to Serbian nationals by
Hungary because they had already stayed
for the maximum 90 days within the allowed
180-day period (‘overstayers’). Refusals due
to overstay more than doubled between 2013

and conditions of stay. Serbian nationals attempted to cross the border more in the autumn months, which is in line with the usually
noticeable increase in asylum applications by
Serbians in the EU before the winter months.*
Most Serbian asylum seekers are from the
impoverished Roma community (85%)** and
they target EU Member States where the asylum granting procedure is lengthy and offers
many benefits while a decision is pending (e.g.
cash allowance).*** The timing of the seasonal
migration indicates a rational decision on the
part of Western Balkan migrants to see out
the cold winter months as asylum seekers.
Nevertheless, Western Balkan nationals, who
benefit from the EU’s visa-free regime, have
one of the highest rejection rates when applying for asylum.

and 2014 (from 1 199 to 2 650), becoming the
principal reason for refusals of entry. These
overstays can be explained by two main phenomena. First, overstays are most likely a
result of the seasonal migration mentioned
above and the subsequent stay while awaiting the outcome of an application. This is
compounded by the fact that Western Balkan nationals benefitting from visa-liberalisation have one of the highest repeated
asylum application rates in the EU (EASO
reporting). This means that many will try to
enter the EU again to attempt to apply for
asylum, even after having been rejected and
returned previously, at which point they are
refused entry for already having exceeded
their permitted period of stay.

The second reason behind refusals of entry
due to overstay is that many Western Balkan nationals engage in legal or illegal work
in the EU (mainly in Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg and Switzerland)*, but still attempt to
move between their countries of origin and
the EU frequently in order to avoid violating
their conditions of stay. Nevertheless, they

On the other hand, refusals due to alerts issued in the SIS II remained stable between
2013 and 2014, while refusals to passengers
with no valid visa or residence permit and
no sufficient means of subsistence for the
period of stay or return fell by 50% and 46%,
respectively.
The rate of refusals per passenger issued to
Serbian nationals is lower on entry to Croatia than on entry to Hungary. It reached the
maximum of 0.2 and 0.6 refusals, respectively, per every 1 000 passengers crossing
the border to the EU. Most refusals were issued in February and March, which was actually the period with the lowest passenger
flows. This might be connected to border
guard capacity to check all passengers more
effectively during less busy periods, without
creating unnecessary delays at BCPs. The majority of refusals of entry in this period were
due to the traveller not being in possession
of a valid residence permit or visa. Indeed
this reason was also the most often cited as
justification for refusal of entry during the
whole of 2014 (193).
The reason behind these incidents is most
likely linked to the fact that these Serbians
were not yet in possession of a biometric
passport, which is a requirement for visafree travel to Croatia.** Refusal alerts issued
in SIS II for certain individuals were the second most used justification to refuse entry.
Interestingly, refusals due to SIS II alerts were
amongst the principal justifications used to
refuse entry to Serbian nationals both in Hungary and Croatia. However, it seems that
overstayers target Hungary to a much greater
extent than Croatia, and the rate has rose in
2014 to more than double what it was in 2013.
For Serbian nationals visa liberalization has
meant that they can travel to the Schengen

area (including Hungary) without a visa for
up to 90 days within a 180 day period.
Serbian nationals are also exempt from visa
obligations in Croatia. However, this country
is not yet part of Schengen, which makes the
onward travel more tedious if the destination
of the migrants is the Schengen area. Therefore, Hungary is targeted more by migrants
attempting to reach the Western Europe.
The comparatively easier onward travel is an
important factor for persons who choose to
exploit the legal channels and stay longer in
order to apply for asylum or find work (legal
or illegal) further within the Schengen area.

3.2. Irregular migration
A thorough analysis of indicators of irregular
migration shows that, compared to 2013, irregular migration pressure from or linked to
the Western Balkan countries increased for
the fourth year in a row. While there were
many interesting changes in the indicators,
this short overview only focuses on the most
important ones in terms of identified risks.
3.2.1. In the region of the Western
Balkans
Detections of illegal border-crossing between BCPs increased from 40 000 in 2013
to 66 000 in 2014 (+27%). The growth of
detections was mostly driven by regional
nationalities, namely persons from the territory of Kosovo* whose numbers increased
by 268%. Albanians also demonstrated an upward trend, however, at a much more moderate 16% pace.
The growth of Kosovo* nationals was so pronounced (an almost fourfold rise compared
to 2013) that the share of Western Balkan nationals rose for the second year in a row to
reach the current 55% of the regional total
for 2014 as indicated by Figure 12.

Furthermore, with 36 200 detections of illegal border-crossing by migrants from the
Western Balkans during 2014, the number
was much closer to the period prior to visa
liberalisation in 2009 (62 000 detections).
Compared to 2013, detections of the transiting
non-European irregular migrants (other nationals in Figure 12) also increased, although
at a much lower 35% annual rate. Significant
differences and quite diverse trends in terms
of countries of origin were again a feature of
this particular flow. Namely, the region saw
a sharp increase of migrants from Afghanistan (178%), Syria (363%), and Iraq (819%). On
the other hand, Pakistanis demonstrated by
far the most significant decline with their
numbers dropping below 600 or 89% less
than in 2013.
Most of the detections were reported at the
land border between Hungary and Serbia
where the numbers rose by an additional 129%
from the already extremely high levels in 2013.
In fact, this border section accounted for seven
out of ten regional detections, up from only
53% share during 2013. Together with the border section between Greece and Albania, the
two sections amounted to 90% of all detections of illegal border-crossing in the region.

This sudden increase and displacement towards the Hungarian-Serbian border accelerated in September 2014 and culminated in
December 2014, when 55% of all detections
for illegal border-crossing across the entire
EU and Schengen area were reported there.
In the case of the border between Greece and
Albania, the increase was less pronounced
(16%) compared to 2013. It was mostly due
to Albanians trying to illegally enter Greece
(circular migration); however, nationals of Pakistan, Syria and Eritrea were also detected
in higher numbers en route from Greece towards Albania.
The asylum procedure was more extensively
misused in the Western Balkans. This was
particularly the case in Serbia, where a huge
gap opened between the number of people
expressing their wish to claim asylum and
the actual number of formal asylum applications (for details see Section 4.3.).

3.2.2. In the EU and Schengen
Associated Countries
Document fraud in connection to
Western Balkan nationals
In 2014, there were 735 detections of document fraud cases involving Western Balkan
nationals on entry to the EU/Schengen area,
mostly from Western Balkan countries, which
represents a significant decrease (-40%) compared to 2013 (Fig. 14). This change of the
trend was led by the decrease of detections
at land border section between Greece and
Albania, where the number of fraudulent
Greek border stamps in Albanian passports
declined accordingly.
However, the overall situation in the field of
document fraud is not so easy and lower number of detected fraudulent documents on entry from third countries does not fully reflect
the reality. Noticeable increase of detections
of document fraud on intra-EU/Schengen

movements shows many Albanian nationals
crossed the external Schengen border with
original authentic travel documents and used
fraudulent documents afterwards mainly on
the routes from Italian airports to the UK
and Ireland (Fig. 14). In 2014, there was a total of 2 400 document fraud cases involving Western Balkan nationals on intra-EU/
Schengen movements, which is more than
triple the number of detections on entry to
the EU/Schengen area.

The Greek-Albanian land border section recorded the biggest, almost 60% decrease in
document fraud detections among all land
border sections. Despite above mentioned
fact Greek-Albanian land border section remains the most affected one with almost
300 document fraud cases in 2014. Albanian
nationals mostly involved in the described
kind of criminal behaviour usually presented
themselves with Albanian passports including completely counterfeited Greek border
stamps.

Document fraud risk indicators by routes
Land borders – remain the most vulnerable type of border in regards to document
fraud cases involving passengers arriving from
Western Balkan countries in 2014. Nevertheless, the number of document fraud detections of Western Balkan country nationals on
entry to the EU/Schengen area showed an almost 50% decrease compared to 2013 thus
reaching the level of ~500 cases.

The Hungarian-Serbian land border section reported very slight increase in document fraud detections including Western
Balkan nationals compared to 2013. At this
land border section, fraudulent documents
were mainly used by Serbian, Albanian and
Kosovo* nationals. On the basis of the available passenger flow data on entry to Hungary from Serbia, the highest ratio between
the number of document fraud cases and
related passenger flow is observed for Afghans, followed by Syrians and Albanians.
Other nationals most probably did not use
fraudulent documents to that extent while
crossing the Hungarian-Serbian land borders
or went undetected.

Albanian nationals representing the biggest

countries. In 2014, a decrease was recorded in
detections of Albanian nationals using fraudulent documents to illegally enter the EU/
Schengen area, from just over 1 000 detec-

tions in 2013 to less than 600 detections
in 2014 (Fig. 15). By contrast, the number
of fraudulent document cases reported on
intra-EU/Schengen movements showed a
marked increase from 1 826 detections in 2013
to 2 194 detections in 2014 (+20%). On intraEU/Schengen movements they were mostly
detected on flights from Italian airports to
the UK and Ireland. The number of Albanians intending to fly from Italian airports to
Ireland increased almost five times. Most of
the above described cases of document fraud
were revealed in Italy and the individuals involved did not reach Ireland.
On entry to the EU/Schengen area from third
countries, Albanian migrants were most commonly detected with authentic Albanian
passports including fraudulent Greek border stamps, fraudulent Albanian passports
or Italian ID cards. In contrast, while travelling within the Schengen area, mostly fraudulent Italian, Greek and Romanian ID cards or
Albanian passports were detected.

nationals of the five visa exempt Western
Balkan countries submitted almost 48 300
asylum applications in EU Member States
and Schengen Associated Countries during
2014. This represented 47% increase compared to 2013 and amounted to almost 10%
of the total EU asylum intake.

4. Annual risk assessment
* According to the CIRAM
model, a ‘threat’ is a force
or pressure acting upon
the external borders
that is characterised by
both its magnitude and
likelihood; ‘vulnerability’
is defined as the capacity
of a system to mitigate
the threat and ‘impact’
is determined as the
consequences of the
threat.

24 of 52

As in previous years, this edition of the annual risk assessment is guided by the CIRAM
working definition of risk as a function of
three main components: threat, vulnerability and impact.* It largely builds on the main
findings from the same exercise for the drafting of WB-ARA 2014.

The selection of the main risks largely builds
on WB-ARA 2014. It also draws heavily from a
detailed analysis of the available monthly statistical data (FRAN, WB-RAN and EDF-RAN),
Frontex operational data and bi-monthly or
quarterly analytical reports provided by both
FRAN and WB-RAN members.

4.1.	Risk of large and sustained secondary movements from
Turkey through the Western Balkans

Illegal border-crossing at the green borders

Specifically there were 29 852 reported persons originating outside the Western Balkans
detected while illegally crossing green borders, which represents a significant increase
compared to the previous year (+35%) and at
the same time a new record since data collection began.

The non-regional migration flow transiting
the Western Balkans is mainly a function of
the developments occurring at Turkey’s borders with Greece and Bulgaria and thus by
extension in the Middle East. The growing
insecurity in this area throughout 2014 provided for an ever increasing pool of wouldbe migrants and/or refugees to accumulate
inside Turkey ready to use all known migration routes towards the EU.

Nationalities
Contributing to this new record are the detections of Syrians (a 363% rise from 2 706 to
12 536) and Afghans (a 170% rise from 4 065
to 10 963) both of which increased significantly compared to the previous year. The
number of Palestinians rose by 172% compared to 2013 and ranked third among the
top nationalities of non-regional transiting
migrants during 2014.

The land route through the Balkan states is
regarded as a well-established, cheaper and
much safer way to reach Europe compared
to the sea travel from Turkey or Greece on
board small and usually overcrowded boats.
During 2014, over 45% of the persons detected while illegally crossing the green borders of the Western Balkan region were by
and large in transit from Turkey via Greece or
Bulgaria (mainly Syrian and Afghan nationals representing 19% and 17%, respectively,
of all detections).

On the other hand, in 2014 the number of
Pakistani migrants decreased significantly
(-89%) ranking only fourth while in 2013 they
were the most common detected nationality.
Similarly, Algerians who ranked fourth in 2013,

While the Greek-former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia and the Greek-Albanian borders
were still dominated by an increasing flow
of regional migrants, during the second half
of 2014 we can also notice a significant rise
in the pressure exerted by the non-regional
flow, especially Syrians but also Afghans on

almost disappeared, with only 59 reported illegal border-crossings in 2014.

The total number of African migrants reported in the region registered a significant
drop compared to 2013 (-66%). Following Algerians (-96%) the most significant decreases
were registered by Moroccans (-96%), Tunisians (-91%) and Malians (-79%). Except for Algerians, this decline could be attributed to a
possible rerouting to the Central Mediterranean route (a 277% increase in reported African migrants compared to 2013).

Regarding the Pakistani nationals, their sharp
drop in the Western Balkans could be partially explained through a possible rerouting
to the Central Mediterranean where their
detections doubled compared to 2013. However, regarding the Algerians, no indication of
a possible displacement can be observed, as
their overall number decreased or ran stable
at most of EU external borders.

these sections. This increase in the transiting flow can be seen as a direct result of the
considerably (almost four times) more detections made in the Eastern Aegean Islands
compared to 2013, which was a reflection of
the pressure building inside Turkey (Fig. 20).

For analytical purposes, the Western-Balkans route can be further divided into three
main sub-routes used by non-regional migrants to reach the northern common borders with the EU Member States, namely
(1) Greece/the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia/Serbia/Hungary; (2) Greece/Albania/Montenegro/Croatia or Serbia; and
(3) Bulgaria/Serbia/Hungary.

In 2014, the Greece-former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia border section was targeted
in increasingly high numbers by both Syrians and Afghans while the Greek-Albanian
border was mostly preferred by Syrians and,
to a lesser extent, by Afghans who were reported in very low numbers at this section.

The first two of these sub-routes are functions of the pressure accumulating in Greece
following the increasing detections in the
Eastern Aegean Sea while the third one is
mainly a function of the pressure building inside Bulgaria originating from this country’s
land border with Turkey.

The flow from Turkey has been building migratory pressure inside Bulgaria over the
past two years, which was further projected on the Bulgarian-Serbian border. The
main nationalities detected at this border
section reflect the overall regional situation, with Afghans and Syrians ranking first
and second, respectively, followed at a distance by Iraqis.

1. Greece/the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia/Serbia/Hungary remained the
main sub-route during 2014 as it provides
more advantages like lower transit time
due to the presence of a more developed
road infrastructure (mainly the Pan-European Corridor X), fewer border sections to
cross and also direct access to the Schengen area.

At the same time, despite their overall regional increase, Palestinians were only detected in very low numbers while entering
the region from its southern borders with
Greece and Bulgaria.

2. Greece/Albania/Montenegro/Croatia or
Serbia was the second alternative used by
non-regional migrants. The main disadFigure 20.The increase in non-regional flow transiting the Western Balkans was linked to

In the north of the region, the Hungarian-Serbian border can be regarded as a good indicator of the total illegal migration pressure
within the Western Balkans, as it is targeted
by both the regional migration flow and the
non-regional flow transiting from Turkey via

vantages to using this sub-route are less
connected road infrastructure, the higher
number of borders to cross and the fact
that it only provides access to an EU Member State and not directly to the area of
free movement. Throughout 2014 the Albanian authorities have noticed a decrease

The described increase in detections of nonregional migrants on entry at the southern
common borders with Greece and Bulgaria is
later more strongly projected on exit at the
northern common borders especially those
with Hungary.
The flow of non-regional migrants at the
Hungarian-Serbian border rose significantly
compared to the previous year, mostly driven
by the surge in the numbers of Syrians and
also Afghans. The increased detections of
Syrian migrants can be linked to the deteriorating security situation in their war-ravaged country while the rise in Afghans can be
partly explained through the bleak prospects
posed by the planned retreat of the ISAF from
Afghanistan and also through Iran’s plan of
tightening its migration policy.
Reports indicate that in December 2014 Iranian authorities decided to extend visas for

living in this country.

important increases in detections of Palestinians and Iraqis in the north of the region.
Considering the security situation in Iraq,
where the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) estimates the numbers of
IDPs at over 1.96 million between December
2013 and November 2014, and the fact that
Frontex operational activities at the GreekTurkish borders indicate that sometimes Iraqis claim being Syrians, their actual numbers
can be even higher, as they may resort to nationality swapping also when detected in the
Western Balkans.
Most of the Palestinians reported at regional
level were detected while exiting the Western Balkans in the north of the region while
strangely their numbers on entry from the
south remained extremely low.
Overall throughout the focus period the
Western Balkan route remained a viable
alternative to the direct sea crossing from
Greece/Turkey to Italy. Additionally, the pool
of would-be migrants aspiring to move to the
EU is constantly increasing due to bad security and humanitarian situation in the Middle
East. This, combined with bad weather conditions at sea during winter months, led to
more migrants opting for the Western Balkan
land route instead of the sea crossing from

Turkey/Greece to Italy in the second half of
the year making Q3 and Q4 2014 the highest
ranking quarters since data collection began.
It is assessed that the transiting flow could
have been even higher if the availability of migration by cargo ship (considered safe at sea
in any weather and also faster) from Turkey
to Italy was not so well publicised. However,
the strengthening of prevention activities
by Turkey might lead to this option becoming unavailable or very expensive in the future, thus pushing the flow further onto the
Western Balkan land route.
Considering the ongoing conflict in Syria and
Iraq, which attracts more and more radicalised foreigners, it is possible that such persons transit the region posing as migrants.
Although no cases of transiting radicalised individuals were reported in 2014, the Western
Balkans countries are considering this possibility and continue to monitor the situation.
In order to prevent participation of their own
nationals in the wars in the Middle East, all of
the regional states have also adopted legislation criminalising such activities following
the UNSCR 2178/2014.

Many times migrants who are transiting the
region are exposed to all sort of health or even
life threatening situations like the lack of shelter, food, or sanitary conditions (as many are
trying to cross the region undetected hiding
in forests exposed to the elements or using
abandoned buildings or makeshift constructions for shelter). Migrants are also prone to
various accidents either while crossing the
borders through difficult terrain to avoid detection or when they use railway tracks to
guide themselves. For example, the authorities of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia indicated that throughout 2014 a total
of eight migrants died in railway accidents as
they were walking by the tracks.

In other cases migrants are transported
across the territory of the Western Balkan
countries in overcrowded vehicles. In such
cases the lack of attention by the drivers or
their desperation to avoid detection and run
away from the police can lead to life threatening traffic accidents. One such case was

the Hungarian-Serbian border section accounting for 29%.
As in the case of illegal crossings at the green
borders, the two most detected nationalities
trying to illegally transit the border through
BCPs were still the Syrians and Afghans.
Afghans’ numbers more than tripled compared to 2013, setting a new record since
data collection began (702) and ranked first
in detected illegal border-crossings at BCPs.
Syrians came out second despite their overall higher numbers and a 40% increase in detections at the common and regional BCPs
compared to 2013.

Illegal border-crossing at BCPs
There were 1 546 non-regional migrants
detected while attempting to illegally cross
the borders hidden in vehicles during 2014.
This represents a significant increase compared to the previous year (+26%) and also a
new record high since data collection began.
During 2014, the border between Croatia and
Serbia reported the most detections, representing 42% of the region’s total, overtaking

32 of 52

Regarding the African migrants, their overall
detections for illegal border-crossing at BCPs
remained relatively low (258), even showing a
decrease compared to 2013 (-25%). The highest ranking nationalities of detected African
migrants were Eritreans (68), followed at a
distance by Algerians (39) and Nigerians (29).
Despite their low numbers, the detections of
Eritreans in the Western Balkans in 2014 represent a new record for this nationality since
data collection began.

Use of false documents
Throughout 2014 there were 272 false documents used by non-regional migrants at the
common and regional Western Balkan borders reported within the WB-RAN, which
represents a 21% increase compared to 2013.
However, it should be borne in mind that false
documents were used by only a tiny minority of irregular migrants transiting the region
en route from Turkey/Greece (less than 1%).
The largest number of detections occurred
at the land borders (64%), mainly on entry to
the region from the south at Greece-the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia section

and on exit in the north part at the Hungarian-Serbian and Croatian-Serbian borders.
Second place is occupied by the air borders
with 31% of detections (mostly linked to Turkish and Syrian nationals), followed by the sea
borders with a 5% share of total.
As can be expected, most of the false documents detected are EU Member State documents, as they allow the holder free travel
within the Schengen area. The analysis of the
supposed countries of issuance may indicate
most common transit (Greece, Bulgaria) and
destination countries (mainly Western European states like Italy, Belgium, France, Spain
or Germany).

Illegal border-crossings from the region
over the common EU/Schengen borders

Link between the decisions to open/close
asylum centres and the flow to Hungary

During the analysed period there were 36 428
nationals from Western Balkan countries detected while illegally crossing the regional
and common borders, which represents a
55% share of the overall IBC detections. The
majority of the cases (36 227) were registered
between BCPs, while only 201 persons were
discovered hiding in vehicles. For the first
time since 2011 the number of regional migrants outpaced the one of the non-regional
transiting flow. Except for the persons originating from the territory of Kosovo*, the illegal border-crossings committed by nationals
of the region are by and large linked to previous visa liberalisation abuse and attempting to avoid entry bans.

There is an apparent historical link between
the evolution of the migration flow and the
legislation changes in Hungary, where the
flow increases or decreases following a decision to respectively open or close the asylum
centres. It is the regional flow that is most
affected by these decisions while the flow
of transiting migrants appears less affected.

The vast majority (35 429) of the nationals
from the Western Balkan countries detected
while attempting to illegally cross the borders were reported at the common borders
with EU Member States/Schengen Associated Countries (especially with Greece and
Hungary and, to a lesser extent, with Croatia and Bulgaria).
While the southern common borders with
Greece were dominated by a rising number
of Albanian nationals as part of the wellknown circular migration phenomenon, the
northern sections with Hungary and Croatia
were affected by a mixed flow mainly consisting of Kosovo* citizens mostly targeting
Western Europe.

The discussed link could be also noticed during the analysed period. Namely, just like the
decision of the Hungarian authorities of July
2013 to close the asylum centres led to a significant decrease in the flow of regional migrants, the reopening of these centres in July
2014 prompted a spectacular rise in the number of migrants originating from the Western
Balkans as shown in Figure 30. This shows
a strong connection between the level of
migration in one EU Member State and the
possibility of the migrants to misuse the asylum system.
The flow of regional migrants detected at
the Hungarian-Serbian land border has more
than tripled compared to the previous year.
The highest share in detections of this flow is
still attributed to Kosovo* citizens who registered a 274% total increase compared to 2013,
mostly due to a huge rise in the second half
of the year. Following their surge in the last
quarter of 2014, Kosovo* citizens surpassed
by far their previous record of Q2 2013 which
at that time triggered a change in the asylum policy of Hungary.
This increased outflow of Kosovo* citizens is
mainly linked to the fact that since Q3 2014
family units who apply for asylum in Hungary

have been sent to open asylum centres, from
where they can afterwards abscond. Another
factor triggering the phenomenon could be
the rumours spread by facilitators according
to which pregnant women immediately receive asylum in Europe as do Kosovo* citizens
who are not ethnic Albanians (for example
the Roma minority). Other rumours circulating in the territory of Kosovo* also contributed to this massive outflow, for example the
alleged need of workforce in the EU or social benefits offered on economic grounds.

The tendency of migrants to target the Hungarian-Serbian border section in significantly
higher numbers can be explained by the fact
that Hungary as a Schengen Member State
has no other internal borders migrants would
then need to bypass on their way to Western
Europe, whereas Croatia is just a member of
the EU and still has internal borders with Slovenia and Hungary which represent another
obstacle on the migrants’ path.

The changing numbers of detected Kosovo*
citizens during the third and fourth quarter
of 2014 brought the Hungarian-Serbian border section ahead of the Greek-Albanian one,
which has been a clear number one section

for detections of regional migrants since the
second half of 2013. The pressure at the common borders with Croatia was much lower.

likely trying to enter the EU illegally to avoid
an entry ban issued because of their previous abuse of legal travel channels.
The border control authorities of the regional
states continue being confronted with the
fact that there is a thin line between refusing exit of their own nationals suspected of
intended abuse of the travel channels to Europe and abusively preventing a citizen from
exercising his legal right to travel.

Most claims coming from this mixed flow
were received by Germany, which accounted
for more than a half of the total intake at
European level followed by Hungary and
Sweden. In terms of percentage the highest increase compared to the previous year
was reported by Hungary (over threefold rise,
by and large caused by the surge of Kosovo*
citizens) followed by Germany with a rise of
over two-thirds.

since the reporting began. This increase was
mainly linked to the higher number of applicants from Serbia, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Montenegro. Nationals of the

At EU level Germany accounted for a 77%

list that entered into force on September
20 th did not appear to have an immediate
deterring effect on nationals of these countries who continued to apply for asylum in
increasing numbers till the end of the year.
One reason for this may be the difficulties
in implementing the changes in the asylum
procedure (speeding the processing and ensuring effective return). Another factor is the
fact that in Germany a migrant continues to
receive social benefits even if his or her asylum claim has been denied until the moment
he or she is effectively returned.

At EU Member States/SACs level Serbians
ranked first with 43% of the total asylum
claims submitted by the five visa-free nationalities from the Western Balkans, followed by
Albanians (28%), Bosnians (15%), nationals of
the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
(12%), and Montenegro (2%).

Additionally, similar to procedures in other
EU Member States, German authorities
sometimes decide to tolerate rejected asylum claimants (Rejected Asylum Applicants
with Toleration – RAAwT) on their territory
due to the difficulty of returning them. This
decision legalises the migrants’ status until
they decide to leave the country on their own.

Figure 34.Western Balkan citizens account for the largest share of
asylum claims filed at EU level by visa-exempt nationalities

The difficulties in effectively shortening the
asylum procedure and implementing returns
coupled with the social benefits offered (even
after rejection of asylum claim) and with
the prospects of receiving a tolerated status
maintain Germany’s attractiveness to Western Balkan nationals and migrants in general.

Considering the seasonality of asylum claims
by nationals from Western Balkan countries
it is likely that an significant share of the applications is submitted by persons who have
previously abused the international protec-

January 2015

Similarly to the high detections of illegal border-crossing by Kosovo* citizens, Hungary
registered a 239% rise in asylum claims coming from citizens of the Western Balkan countries. Kosovo* citizens accounted for over 98%
of these claims.

tion system in the same EU Member State
(repeated applicants).
This is also suggested by the EASO data, according to which in January 2015, at EU level
there were 6 199 people who had previously
applied for asylum in the same EU Member
State and out of these 49% were nationals
from the Western Balkans (see Fig. 35).
In order to prevent asylum misuse in the EU
Serbia and Albania penalised facilitation of
transport for people with such intentions.
However, such deeds are difficult to prove.
Western Balkan countries also apply interview tactics and profiling of passengers on
exit in order to try and prevent future asylum misuse in the EU. Media campaigns are
also used to dissuade potential migrants from
seeking asylum out of economic motives.

In the rest of the EU, Germany emerged as the
main destination for Kosovo* migrants. More
specifically, after the surge in illegal bordercrossings noticed in the second half of 2014,
the number of asylum claims submitted by
Kosovo* citizens in Germany doubled compared to 2013. Moreover, during the last three
months of the year Kosovo* citizens also rose
to the third place in the overall top of asylum claimants from the Western Balkans in
Germany, close behind Albanians. The scale
of the asylum system’s misuse in Germany is
indicated by a very low admission rate for Kosovo* citizens in this country (less than 1%).
Judging by these developments, it is entirely
possible that Hungary is only seen as a transit country by Kosovo* citizens, who use the
asylum applications just as a way of reaching other EU destination countries, especially
Germany. In this regard, while it is natural
that Hungary as a country of first entry receives the largest number of asylum claims
from Kosovo* citizens (who mainly seek asylum as a way to be set free after illegal border-crossing), in the rest of the EU Germany
ranks first by far in the received number of
applications from these nationals. This indicates Germany as the main destination for
Kosovo* citizens. However, France may also
become a target after the decision to remove
Kosovo* from the safe countries list has been
adopted and so could Sweden if Germany effectively implements measures to deter the
flow to its territory.

Illegal stay in the EU

Distribution of asylum claims by Kosovo* citizens in the EU/SACs

Compared to 2013 the numbers of illegal stayers from Kosovo* registered a 73% increase, in
line with their surge in illegal border-crossings and subsequent asylum applications and
misuse.
As in the case of asylum applications, Hungary
and Germany reported the highest numbers
of illegal stayers from Kosovo.* However, if in
the case of asylum claims Hungary ranked
first as explained above, in the case of illegal stayers, Germany reported the highest
number of detections at EU level which further indicates this country as the main destination for Kosovo* citizens.
Document fraud inside the EU Member
States/SAC territory
In 2014, there were 2 389 nationals of the
five visa-exempt Western Balkan countries
and 55 Kosovo* citizens reported using false
documents on intra EU/Schengen travels.
The most cases were reported by Italy, the
UK, and Greece.

As regards nationalities, similar to the situation on entry across external borders, the
great majority of false document users from
the Western Balkans reported on intra EU/
Schengen travels were Albanians, accounting for over 92% of all cases reported in 2014.
The cases reported on intra-EU/Schengen
movements represent 63% of the total detections of false document users from the
Western Balkans while only around 20% were
reported on entry from third countries.

Amongst the five visa-exempt nationalities
Albanians ranked first registering a 21% increase compared to last year, while the rest
of illegal stayers from the region showed relatively stable trends. Most detections of illegal
stayers from these countries were reported
by Greece, Germany, Hungary and Sweden.
Greece was mainly targeted by Albanians as
part of the circular migration to this country,
while Hungary mostly reported Serbians returning from the EU.

During the analysed period there were 47 338
illegal stayers from the Western Balkans region reported at the level of the EU Member
States/SACs out of which 36 438 were citizens of the five visa-exempt countries and
10 900 Kosovo* citizens.

In terms of documents, there were 2 726 false

throughout 2014. Most of these documents
were issued by the EU Member States/SACs
with Italy and Greece accounting for a 63%
share of the reported total.
Measures implemented to counter the

Measures aimed at preventing departure and

In order to curb the outflow, the authorities in Pristina are trying to apply measures

5 150 persons were convinced not to leave the

territory. However, Kosovo* citizens are entitled to travel and stay in Serbia for 15 days
using their ID cards and despite the best efforts by the authorities sometimes there is
no legal basis for issuing an administrative
decision to refuse their exit.

Kosovo* are also likely to have a pronounced
deterrence effect on other nationalities transiting the Hungarian-Serbian border on their
way to Western Europe.

Furthermore, extensive public campaigns (e.g.
‘Stay in Kosovo’) have been implemented by
the authorities in Pristina in order to quell rumours about social benefits systems in the
EU or alleged demand for Kosovo* economic
migrants in certain sectors of the economy.

In order to help relieve the pressure accumulating inside Hungary from this increased flow
of Kosovo* citizens transiting Serbia, the two
countries have signed a Memorandum of Understanding allowing the transport of these
migrants by land across the territory of Serbia to the administrative boundary line with
Kosovo* with the aim of securing more viable return options. The Memorandum came
into effect on 10 March 2015.

Once in Serbia migrants can prepare their
illegal journey to Europe for the 15-day period of legal stay undisturbed by the Serbian
authorities. At the same time the Serbian
authorities cannot refuse entry of Kosovo*
nationals as such actions would be contrary
to their international agreement to allow free
movements of these people inside Serbia.
However, once the increase in the flow of
irregular migrants from Kosovo* was observed in August 2014, the Hungarian and
Serbian authorities started to implement
joint border patrols on their common border
in order to tackle this rise. Given the mentioned legal constraints the authorities can
only take measures against Kosovo* citizens
when they are detected trying to illegally
cross the borders.
Germany also supported these activities by
sending additional personnel and surveillance equipment.
Further inside the EU territory multi-lateral
arrangements were agreed and signed between Germany, Austria, and Hungary to
establish advanced checks for preventing irregular internal movements.
It is assessed that these measures although
aimed at reducing the flow of migrants from

40 of 52

Measures aimed at ensuring returns

Readmission agreements between Kosovo*
and a number of 22 countries are already in
place and the authorities in Prishtina have declared themselves ready to accept repatriation and reintegration of their own nationals.
Germany has further reduced the time needed
to process asylum applications from Kosovo*
citizens and is planning to launch charter
return flights directly to Kosovo* around 15
March 2015 by applying ‘last come, first returned’ principle. These measures are hoped
to have a deterrence effect and prevent additional migrants from leaving Kosovo.*
However, these measures do not totally eliminate the risk, as push factors (e.g. poverty
and lack of opportunities) are still present
in the territory of Kosovo* and maintain the
country’s migratory potential. It is possible
that the described deterrence measures of
Germany coupled with the multi-lateral prevention activities (SRB, HUN, AUT, DEU) will
lead to a change of destination and routes
used by newly departing Kosovo* citizens
and also to secondary movements by those
already in the EU.

4.3.	Risk of use of international protection system in the Western
Balkans by transiting migrants to avoid detention and
impede return procedures
The phenomenon of circumventing entry and
stay through use of international protection
system in the Western Balkans is not a new
phenomenon. It was extensively described
in previous annual WB-RAN analyses, either
on its own or in the modus operandi section of
the risk of high and sustained transit movements from Turkey via Greece.
Throughout the analysed period the only
difference as regards this phenomenon is its
magnitude given that the asylum applications
and expressed intentions for asylum by transiting migrants rose significantly in the entire
region and neighbouring EU Member States,
mostly in line with the increase in the transiting flow. The main modus operandi is rather
simple and can be described by highlighting
the situation in Serbia, broadly corresponding to experiences in the other five Western
Balkan countries as well. Serbia has an asylum procedure which is in line with the EU
standards. As such, the asylum procedure is
usually done in stages.
First, the migrant expresses his/her intention to apply for asylum, after which he/she is
sent to an asylum centre inside Serbia, which
he/she needs to reach within 72 hours. The
second stage is to register in the indicated
asylum centre where he/she is allowed to
stay for 15 days during which he/she needs
to complete the final stage, i.e. the filling of
the official asylum claim.
After detection at the borders or inland, migrants express an intention to apply for asylum and so to avoid being prosecuted for
illegal border-crossing or illegal stay. They are
then instructed to report to an asylum centre. After arriving to the centre, most of the
migrants abscond only a few days after ex-

pressing the intention to file an application
for asylum while the rest abscond after formally submitting the application.
In fact, during 2014 in Serbia there were
16 500 expressed intentions to apply for asylum both at the borders and inside the territory. Out of these, only 1 354 migrants went
to get registered in the accommodation centres and even fewer (388) actually filed an official request for asylum. Overall according to
UNHCR data only 14 final asylum decisions
were reached in Serbia during 2014 (eight rejections, five subsidiary protection and one
refugee status). This is, by and large, due to
the fact that the great majority of migrants
have absconded from the asylum centres before the procedure could be finalised.
In 2014, the number of asylum applications
submitted by transiting non-regional migrants in the six Western Balkan countries
decreased by 18% compared to 2013, despite
the overall increase in the number of illegal
border-crossings by non-regional migrants.

UNHCR views on asylum in the Western Balkans region
* This designation is
without prejudice to
positions on status,
and is in line with
UNSCR 1244 and the
ICJ Opinion on the
Kosovo declaration of
independence.

With the exception of Kosovo*, all countries in the region are party both to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol. All countries have national
legal and institutional frameworks in place governing asylum.
Serbia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro and Albania, are all candidate countries to the European Union (EU). Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo* are potential
candidates. All countries have EU visa liberalization agreements in place, except for Kosovo.*
The countries of the region have witnessed a sharp increase in to the number of asylum
seekers from outside the region in recent years. In 2012 there were 5 006 registered asylum
claims whereas in 2014 over 20 000† asylum claims were registered in the region. It is likely
these figures represent only a proportion of potential asylum seekers transiting through
the region. It should also be noted that all will have proceeded through EU Member States
prior to reaching the Western Balkans.
Despite the fact that the majority of asylum seekers are from refugee producing countries,
including Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Eritrea and Somalia, very few persons acquire protection
in the region. In 2013, out of over 10 000 asylum claims, only 63 persons were granted some
form of protection status. In 2014, 39† persons had acquired such status.
The vast majority of persons seeking international protection in the region move on in an
irregular manner, often soon after lodging their asylum claims. UNHCR monitoring suggests
the high-rate of onward movement is motivated by a variety of factors, including a desire to
join diaspora communities elsewhere as well as a perception that other countries provide
a more favourable protection environment, and in particular better integration prospects.

4.4.	Risk of increased smuggling of stolen vehicles, drugs and
weapons across the common borders

Stolen vehicles

Drugs

Regarding the detection of stolen vehicles
the situation throughout the Western Balkans remains similar to previous years with
mostly higher-end cars stolen from the EU
and meant for being used inside the region.

Regarding the trafficking in illicit drugs, at
regional level the most commonly detected
substance was cannabis, most of which was
grown within the region and trafficked internally or to the EU. During 2014 Albanian Border Police detected around 9.5 tonnes of this
product, most of which (4.2 tonnes) at the
sea BCPs, bound for Italy or the rest of EU.

There were 122 persons involved, mostly detected at the Serbian borders with Hungary
(50) and Croatia (41) and also at the Croatian borders with Montenegro (20), and
Bosnia and Herzegovina (9). Regarding the
nationalities, the majority of the persons detected smuggling stolen vehicles were nationals of the Western Balkan countries (59%),
mainly Serbians (45) followed by Bosnians (9),
Albanians (8) and Montenegrins (5). Also,
an important share of detections (32%) was
represented by citizens of the EU Member
States/Schengen Associated Countries with
Bulgarians ranking first followed by Germans
and Croats.

At the Albanian blue borders there were over
3.9 tonnes of marijuana detected mostly on
speedboats bound for Italy or Greece from
the district of Vlores and Durres.
At the land borders, most of the seizures of
cannabis made by Albania were at its border
section with Greece (0.9 tonnes).
However, most detections occurred in the
first six months of 2014, with a significant
decrease in the second half of the year after
the Albanian authorities performed complex
operations meant to disrupt the cultivation
and processing of cannabis and other drugs
in the areas of Lazarat and Dukagjin. Following these interventions and also other

According to data reported in the framework
of JO Focal Points Land 2013 extension and
2014, throughout the focus period at the borders between the EU Member States and the
countries from the Western Balkans there
were 92 stolen vehicles reported, mostly on
exit from the EU towards the Western Balkan region and destined for use inside the
Balkans countries. The vast majority of detections were of stolen cars (77) followed by
vans (7), motorcycles (3), buses (3) and lorries (2). The most reported makes of vehicles
were Volkswagen, BMW, followed by Mercedes and Audi.

Balkans are still a source of small weapons
given the known local gun culture.
According to Albanian media reports, a low
level market in small weapons operates in
the area of Albania/Kosovo*/Montenegro. Albanian groups from the northern region apparently steal weapons and explosives from
military depots in Albania or purchase them
from rural areas and then sell them in Europe.

There were also detections of heroin throughout the region but generally the seized
quantities decreased and no changes were
observed as regards the modus operandi. There
were also other drug seizures like cocaine and
amphetamines but the quantities reported
at the borders were low.

Moreover, apparently the demand for explosives by the OCGs has increased in connection to the proliferation of contract killings
with the use of remote controlled improvised
explosive devices (IEDs) since 2012. Media
reports tend to suggest that explosives are
bought from Montenegro under the cover of
Albanian private companies involved in stone

A case discovered by the Montenegrin police
indicates the involvement of Albanian organised crime in cocaine trafficking in cooperation with South American drug cartels. In this
case from June 2014 the Montenegrin police
have seized 250 kg of cocaine shipped from
Colombia to an Albanian company. The investigations pointed out that the transport
originating from Colombia was supposed to
transit the Western Balkan region and other
EU Member States before reaching Spain.
