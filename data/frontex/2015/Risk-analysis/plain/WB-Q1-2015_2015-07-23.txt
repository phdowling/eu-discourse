Frontex official publications fall into four main categories: risk analysis, training, operations
and research, each marked with a distinct graphic identifier. Risk analysis publications
bear a triangular symbol formed by an arrow drawing a triangle, with a dot at the centre.
Metaphorically, the arrow represents the cyclical nature of risk analysis processes and
its orientation towards an appropriate operational response. The triangle is a symbol of
ideal proportions and knowledge, reflecting the pursuit of factual exactness, truth and
exhaustive analysis. The dot at the centre represents the intelligence factor and the focal
point where information from diverse sources converges to be processed, systematised
and shared as analytical products. Thus, Frontex risk analysis is meant to be at the centre
and to form a reliable basis for its operational activities.

Introduction

Concept
The Western Balkans Risk Analysis Network (WB-RAN) performs monthly exchanges of statistical data and information
on the most recent irregular migration
developments affecting the region. This
information is compiled at Frontex RAU
level and analysed in cooperation with
the regional partners on a quarterly and
annual basis. The annual reports offer a
more in-depth analysis of the occurring
developments and phenomena which impact the regional and common borders,
while the quarterly reports are meant
to provide regular updates and identify
emerging trends in order to maintain situational awareness. Both types of reports
are aimed at offering support for strategic
and operational decision making.

Methodology
The Western Balkans Quarterly is focused
on quarterly developments as reflected by
the seven key indicators of irregular migration: (1) detections of illegal bordercrossing between BCPs, (2) detections of
illegal border-crossing at BCPs, (3) refusals of entry, (4) detections of illegal stay,
(5) asylum applications, (6) detections of
facilitators, and (7) detections of fraudulent documents.1

1

Please note that the analysis of this indicator
is now limited to WB-RAN countries
only, given that EU Member States have
transitioned to the European Union
Document-Fraud (EDF) reporting scheme.

The data presented in the overview are
derived from monthly statistics provided
within the framework of the WB-RAN
and reference period statistics from common border sections of neighbouring EU
Member States (Croatia Bulgaria, Greece,
Hungary and Romania). In addition, the
Western Balkans Quarterly is drawing
from FRAN Quarterly reports and also
data analysed in the framework of other
risk analysis networks (FRAN, EDF-RAN).

Structure
The current issue of the Western Balkans
Quarterly is the first following a new approach adopted for risk analysis quarterlies.
The first part offers a general Situational
overview broken down by main areas of
work of border-control authorities and police activities related to irregular migration.
The second part contains more in depth
Featured risk analyses of particular phenomena. The structure of the report may
still be subject to some readjustments.
Changes in data scope after Croatia’s
entry to the EU
Important changes in the collection and
use of data for Western Balkans Quarterly
were introduced upon Croatia’s joining the
EU in July 2013. Firstly, data for Slovenia,
which now has no external borders with
non-EU Western Balkan countries, has not
been included in the report since the third

quarter of 2013. Slovenian historical data
were also excluded from the tables in order to make the comparison with previous
quarters analytically meaningful.
Secondly, as Croatia-Hungary and Croatia-Slovenia border sections have now
become internal EU-borders they are no
longer covered by this report.
Thirdly, after joining the EU, Croatian data
on illegal stay data are limited to detections at the border. More precisely, Croatia’s illegal stay data only include cases
detected on exit, while inland detections
are not included. The analysis of the illegal stay indicator takes this fact into
consideration.
Changes in data scope after Kosovo*’s
entry to the WB-RAN
Starting from the first quarter of 2014 data
from Kosovo* on key indicators of irregular migration will be included in the reporting making it possible to get a more
comprehensive picture on the irregular
movements in the region. However, as
there is no historical data available for Kosovo*, the new data does in some measure
impact the comparisons of the examined
period with the previous quarters. When
necessary for analytical purposes, some
comparisons can be made also excluding
data from Kosovo* and noted in the text.

Situation at the border

Border surveillance
Illegal border-crossings

At the southern borders of Greece, Albanians remained the most detected nationality, representing the well-known circular
migration, while the northern section (the
Hungarian border) was still targeted by a
more diverse flow, mostly made up of Kosovo* citizens.

During the analysed period, there were
27 646 nationals of the Western Balkans
(Fig. 2) detected illegally crossing the regional and common green borders, which
represents a 62% share of the overall IBC
detections (regional and non-regional migrants). The vast majority (over 99%) of the
nationals from Western Balkan countries
detected while attempting illegal bordercrossing were reported at the common
borders with EU Member States, especially
Hungary (90%) and Greece (9%).

The remaining 38% of the overall detections at the regional green borders were
mostly non-regional migrants (Fig. 3) in
transit from Turkey, Greece and Bulgaria
(mainly Afghan and Syrian nationals, representing 15% and 13%, respectively, of

the total overall detections). The 16 367
non-regional migrants reported at the
green borders represented a significant
rise (+12%) compared to the previous quarter and a new quarterly record since the
WB-RAN data collection began.
Overall, at regional level, in the analysed
quarter detections of Afghans increased
significantly (+16%) compared to the previous three months, which made them top
detected non-regional nationality, ahead
of Syrians, whose numbers decreased by
14% compared to the last quarter of 2014.
The detections of Iraqi, Pakistani and Somali migrants all tripled in comparison to
the previous quarter, marking the most
notable increases in the analysed period.
Furthermore, although they registered
lower overall totals, the share of Bangladeshi and Iranians also significantly increased during the first quarter.

tween BCPs (as this flow is more likely to
rely on facilitation than the regional one).

By and large, the detections of facilitators
tend to follow the overall trend of the detections of illegal border-crossing both between and at BCPs. During the first quarter
of 2015, the number of facilitators was 517,
representing a 6% increase compared to
the previous three-month period, roughly
mirroring the 12% increase of the non-regional migration flow detected at and be-

As regards nationalities, 78% of all facilitators detected in the current quarter
were nationals of Western Balkan countries while 13% were citizens of the neighbouring EU Member States/Schengen
Associated Countries.

Over half of all detections were reported
by Serbia at its borders with Hungary and
the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, but also inland. This, along with the
fact that over 55% of the facilitators reported at regional level were Serbian nationals indicates that Serbia remains the
country most affected by the transiting
flow in the region.

Border checks

Clandestine entries

The most commonly used fraudulent
documents were passports, ID cards and
residence permits. As for ID cards as in previous quarters the large majority (48 out of
50) were EU Member States’ documents,
as they can be used to move freely inside
the Schengen area and the EU.

In Q1 2015, a total of 348 of non-regional
migrants were detected while attempting to illegally cross the border hidden in
vehicles (a 29% decrease compared to Q4
2014). Additionally, 42 nationals of Western
Balkan countries were reported at BCPs.

As far as detections of false passports are
concerned, the majority (161) were reportedly issued by countries from the region.
Most of these documents were Albanian
(77), largely used by Albanian nationals
(75), most likely in an attempt to avoid
entry bans following the abuse of visa
liberalisation.

Document fraud
During the first quarter, there were 252
cases of fraudulent document use reported
by the six Western Balkan countries, which
number is similar to those of both the previous quarter and the same period of 2014.

Refusals of entry

Serbia continued to rank first, with 37%
of all regional detections, followed by the
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,
and Albania with 21% and 20% shares,
respectively.

In the analysed period, the number of refusals of entry decreased by 17% compared
to the previous quarter: from roughly
10 200 to 8 500. Compared to the corresponding quarter of 2014, the numbers
remained relatively stable.

As regards nationalities, during this quarter
Albanians continued to rank first amongst
fraudulent document users followed by
Kosovo* citizens and Syrians.

As usual, a large majority of refusals of
entry was issued at the land border (92%)
while the remaining 8% were largely reported at the air border.
All the reporting countries issued lower
numbers of refusals during the first quarter compared to the previous period, with
the exception of Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Montenegro, and Romania, which registered modest increases. Most of the refusals reported by the neighbouring EU
Member States were addressed to nationals of the Western Balkans (99%) while in
the six regional countries just under a half
of refused persons were local residents followed by EU nationals.
The overall number of refusals issued to
the non-regional migrants originating
from Turkey/Greece continued to represent a very low share of the total, further
indicating that these people directly targeted the green border without even attempting legal entry.

Situation in the Western Balkans

Illegal stay within the Western
Balkans countries

As regards nationalities, Syrians ranked
first among detected illegal stayers, mainly
reported by Albania, followed by Serbians
who mainly targeted Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Albanians detected in the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.

There were 1 284 detections of illegal stay
in the first quarter of 2015, reported by
the six Western Balkan countries, which
represents a significant decrease in relation to the previous quarter (-43%) but is
roughly similar to the corresponding period of 2014.

were detected for illegal stay. Also the fact
that only just over 500 of the detected illegal stayers were of the same nationalities as the non-regional flow originating
from the Greece/Turkey area indicates
that the Western Balkans remains just a
transit region.

Interestingly, although Afghans ranked
first in terms of detections of illegal border-crossing during this quarter, only 14

Large and sustained secondary
movements from Turkey
through the Western Balkans
In the first quarter of 2015, the pressure exerted by transiting migrants on the southern common borders with Greece and
Bulgaria continued to be strongly projected on exit at the northern common
borders, especially the Hungarian border.
This suggests that many entries in the region may go undetected.

Main non-regional
nationalities
The increased detections of Afghans moving through the Western Balkans can be
partly explained by the fact that visas for
over 500 000 Afghans living in Iran are
bound to expire in June 2015 (they were
extended for six months in December
2014) and it is still unclear how many will
be renewed given Iran’s plans of repatriating foreigners residing on its territory.
These uncertainties in Iran coupled with
the questionable security situation in Afghanistan after the retreat of the ISAF and
the tightening of the labour policy in Saudi
Arabia are likely to push more Afghans to
see migration to the EU as their only option of a better life.

The southern part of the region, namely
the common borders of the Western Balkan countries with Greece and Bulgaria
continued to be the entry points for the
transiting non-regional migration flow
from Turkey en route to Western Europe.
The two sections were functions of the
high number of detections in the Eastern
Aegean Islands (similar to the previous
quarter) and of the accumulating pressure inside Bulgaria, respectively.
In the northern part of the region, the
Hungarian-Serbian border continued to
be a good indicator of the total illegal migration situation in the Western Balkans,
accurately mirroring the overall trend of
the main nationalities transiting the area
en route from Turkey to Western Europe
in Q1 2015.

The increase in the numbers of Pakistanis
can be partially linked to the rising number of them arriving in the Eastern Aegean
Islands but also to a higher share of Pakistani illegal stayers in Greece now opting
to leave towards other EU destinations due
to the current economic situation and the
lack of job opportunities in this country.
The increased detections of Iraqis can be
explained by the bad security situation in
Iraq, and the ever increasing number of

IDPs due to the protracted conflict (IDMC
estimates over 2.176 million between December 2013 and 15 January 2015). Frontex
operational activities at the Greek-Turkish border suggest that many Iraqis claim
to be Syrians when detected for illegal
border-crossing. Thus, their overall numbers in the Western Balkans could also be
higher but masked by continued nationality swapping.
When analysing the decreasing dynamics
of Syrian migration throughout the Western Balkans in the first quarter of 2015,
several factors should be borne in mind.
Firstly, their number in Q4 2014 (the base
for comparison) was the highest ever recorded number of Syrian migrants. Secondly, the link between detections in the
Western Balkans and those on the Eastern Aegean Islands should be carefully considered. Specifically given that March 2015
was the second highest month in terms
of detections of Syrians in the Aegean following two very low periods in January
and February (possibly linked to bad sea
state) and the general time elapsed between detections and onward movements
it is likely that the surge of March will only
be fully reflected in the Western Balkans
in Q2. Furthermore the increasing travel
restrictions (visa requirements, closure
of borders) imposed on Syrians by other
countries of the region (such as Lebanon
or Jordan) or by North African countries
(Algeria, Mauritania, Morocco, Egypt) will
likely continue to push these nationals to
travel to the EU via Turkey and the Western Balkan route.
The overall number of African migrants has
registered a significant rise during the analysed period both compared to the previous quarter (more than double) and to
the same quarter of 2014 (+80%). This was

wb-ran · q1 2015

mainly driven by the increase in Somalis
(a sevenfold rise compared to the previous quarter), who now represent a third
of the total flow of Africans transiting the
Western Balkans. Although their overall
numbers were lower, Malians, Ivorians,
Cameroonians and Algerians registered
significant increases during the analysed
period, all of them roughly tripling their
quarterly average of last year.

While the numbers of Somalis detected
for illegal border-crossing increased both
on entry in the south and on exit to the
north of the region, the majority of the
other mentioned African nationals were
reported largely at the Hungarian-Serbian border.

Outlook
Overall the Western Balkan route will likely
remain a viable alternative to the direct
sea crossing from Greece or Turkey to Italy, mostly due to the lower costs of facilitation. Although the improvement of sea
conditions during the summer will likely
encourage some of the migrants entering
Greece in the Eastern Aegean to move onwards to Italy by sea, the increasing pool
of would-be migrants fed by the bad security and humanitarian situation in the Middle East will likely fuel both these routes
significantly.

In the northern part of the region, the
flow of regional migrants detected at the
common Hungarian-Serbian land border
registered a 33% rise compared to the last
quarter of 2014.
However, most of this increase was caused
by the surge in the numbers of migrants

originating from Kosovo* during the first
two months of the year (namely, January
and February 2015 were record months
for detections of Kosovo* nationals since
data collection began) before dramatically
dropping in March (over 30 times less than
in February). This spectacular drop during
March was the result of an array of concerted countermeasures implemented at
the regional level and of the most targeted
EU Member States.

ders, namely the Greek-Albanian section, reemerged as the most targeted by
the regional migration flow (by and large
Albanians as part of the circular migration to Greece).

These measures (i.e. media campaigns,
enhanced surveillance at the HungarianSerbian border, measures inside the territories of Hungary, Austria and Germany,
speeding of the asylum process in Germany coupled with direct returns to Pristina, etc.) were more extensively described
in the WB-ARA 2015.

The claims filed by Kosovo* citizens and
those from the five visa-exempt countries
put the overall number of asylum applications from Western Balkan nationals at EU
level to a new quarterly record.

The decrease in the numbers of Kosovo*
nationals in March brought down the
regional flow targeting the HungarianSerbian border, very close to its average
monthly values from before August 2014
(when the Kosovo* surge started).
However, given that most of the push
factors are still present in Kosovo* (the
youngest population in Europe, lack of
opportunities, etc.) it would not be surprising if the calm period (when options
are rethought) is followed by another increase in the flow of these nationals on
new routes and towards new destinations.
The pressure at the common borders with
Croatia remained at a lower level with only
136 regional migrants reported during this
quarter, mainly Albanians and Bosnians.
Following the described decrease at
the Hungarian-Serbian border section,

Most claims coming from this mixed flow
continued to be received by Germany, followed by Hungary and Austria.
The claims submitted by nationals of the
five visa-exempt countries continued the
upward trend observed throughout the
previous year also during the analysed
period.
Similarly to the trends described throughout the second half of 2014, in the analysed
period, Kosovo* citizens continued to target Hungary and Germany with their asylum claims. The importance of Germany
as the main destination for these nationals (also mentioned in the WB-ARA 2015)
was again reflected in the figures registered during the analysed quarter.
However, a close look at the number of
asylum claims submitted by Kosovo* citizens and their distribution at EU level
during March reveals a decreasing trend,
which will most probably continue in the
future, especially considering the sharp

Schengen Associated Countries, out of
which 10 289 were citizens of the five visaexempt countries and 11 954 were Kosovo*

share of the total, followed Albanians (29%)
and Serbians (10%).
As in the case of asylum applications, Hungary and Germany reported the highest

The cases reported on intra-EU/Schengen movements represent 57% of the total

drop in illegal border-crossings by these
nationals at the Hungarian-Serbian border during the same month. More exactly,
in March 2015 the number of asylum requests by Kosovo* nationals submitted in
Hungary decreased (in line with the drop
in detections of IBCs by these nationals
at the Serbian border). At the same time,
the number of claims lodged in Germany
continued to increase. However, this increase was only sustained by the secondary movements of Kosovo* citizens who
had already managed to reach Hungary
before the abovementioned international
countermeasures achieved their deterrence effect.

Source: EDF data as of 19 May 2015

Outlook
The decreasing numbers of Kosovo* nationals applying for asylum in Hungary
during March 2015 likely indicates subsiding of this phenomenon in the future.
However, the asylum applications by the
other five visa-exempt nationalities continue to show an increasing trend with
Albanians registering the most notable increases during the analysed period.

Humanitarian implications
of illegal migration through
the Western Balkans

As already pointed out in the Western Balkans Annual Risk Analysis 2015 migrants
many times subject themselves to all kinds
of hazards varying from exposure to the
elements, lack of appropriate sanitary conditions and all the way to serious road or
even railway accidents. Recent events indicate that although railway tracks provide
migrants with a better chance of moving
undetected (e.g. no police check-posts)
they come with a great accident risk, especially in the tight passes.

tion-related railway accident in the Western Balkans to date claimed the lives of
14 people. The 14 victims were part of a
group of around fifty migrants (mostly
Afghan and Somali) who were using the
railroad to guide themselves across the
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
in the vicinity of Veles, most likely on their
way to Serbia.

Furthermore, unconfirmed media reports
indicate that many migrants transiting the
Western Balkans are robbed or kidnapped
for profit by different criminal groups taking advantage of their disorientation and
helplessness. The authorities of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia are
currently investigating the media reports
suggesting that a number of Afghan migrants are kidnapping Middle Eastern migrants whom they are holding for ransom
in secluded houses in the area of Vaksince.

This latest incident once again highlights
the humanitarian implications of illegal
migration as even across the land routes
migrants expose themselves to life threatening situations.
In addition, migrants endure very difficult
conditions of stay while en route through

Throughout 2014 the authorities of the
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
indicated that eight migrants lost their
lives in while walking along train tracks.
Unfortunately the situation continued in
April 2015 when the most serious migraFigure 11. Human remains on the rail

the Western Balkans. Reports during the
first Quarter of 2015 suggested that many
were often exposed to freezing and were
inadequately prepared for the winter condition in the Balkans.

As demonstrated by the latest tragedies
in the Mediterranean Sea the illegal migration poses serious risks to the lives of
migrants. However, it is not only the crossing of the blue borders that is dangerous
as life threatening situations also occur on
the routes targeting the EU land borders.

Departures from northern
Montenegro accelerate
in Q1 2015
According to a recent survey by an independent NGO, roughly 3 500 people moved
out of northern part of Montenegro since
the beginning of 2015.

Figure 13. Sandzak region is split between Serbia and Montenegro

Northern Montenegro is part of so-called
Sandzak region that stretches across the
border into Serbia. In Montenegro it consists of these five towns – Pljevlja, Bijelo
Polje, Berane, Rožaje, and Plav. Roughly
30% of the population there is Muslim and
local media reports suggest that this is indeed the group that is leaving for mostly
Germany.

© Wikipedia.com, 2015

In one recorded account, the interviewed
asylum seekers is Muslim and has sold his
car and his only cow (EUR 700) to finance
the trip to Germany. In another case, a
Muslim family of five describes how well
they are treated in Germany and that they
are currently getting EUR 1 800 per month.
This amount – they claim – allows them
to save a lot of money for eventual return
to Montenegro (they know that their asylum claim will be rejected).
