Dear reader,
I am pleased to introduce you to the European Joint Master’s Programme in Strategic
Border Management, an innovative education programme for border and coast guard
leaders leading to an internationally recognised Master’s degree.
The Programme is specifically tailored for the current and future leaders of the border
and coast guard organisations in developing common strategies to manage the border security challenges at European level, and to reinforce and streamline cooperation
between national border and coast guard authorities.
With this course, Frontex has created an innovative teaching and learning environment
to develop leaders with a strategic vision and to significantly contribute to the harmonisation of practices for leading and managing the external borders of the European Union.
This Programme offers a unique opportunity to explore new ways of facing challenges
of border security, to create pan-European solutions for the common needs of EU border management and to test them in a safe environment under the guidance of the
best teachers, mentors, specialists and policy makers from across the EU. Through the
Programme you will have the opportunity to study together, to learn from each other
and to share best practices.
I would like to invite you, the future students and leaders of Europe’s Border and Coast
Guard community to be part of this unparalleled experience. Prepare the European border and coast guard community for the challenges of the future and be the ones who
make the difference and who shape the culture of your organisation.

© European Union

European
perspective
The need to achieve a European border and coast
guard (BG) common culture resides in the BG organisations’ role as drivers of organisational culture
and organisational change, to promote a culture
within the organisations that integrates shared EU
values and facilitates that border guards at all levels (from front-line operational officers to specialists and managers) work together and that they
understand and apply common practices and EU
procedures, therefore increasing the deployability
of BG experts in joint operations. The programme’s
focus on strategic leadership and European cooperation contributes to BG organisations development in this respect.

The European Joint Master’s in Strategic Border Management offers a unique opportunity to study in a joint
programme where the leading expertise is drawn from
across the European Union (EU), valuing cooperation
between operational and academic approaches and
encouraging peer-learning.
The ethos of the programme has at its core the enhancement of interoperability at EU borders and harmonisation of learning and professional standards
whilst respecting diversity, in line with the Bologna
process. The master’s is inclusive of international expertise for delivery of the programme and is accessible to all EU organisations with a border and coast
guard function.

Common
culture
The programme supports an integrated strategic
and intelligence-driven approach to border management. It aims to apply management principles
to organisational development. It promotes European harmonisation and the interoperability
of border and coast guard activities by training
the future leaders in the light of common European learning standards, philosophy and values.

‘The common European border guard culture needs leadership’
The activities of Frontex in the field of border guard education aim to promote a European border guard culture with high standards on fundamental rights, ethics
and leadership. The rationale for developing a European joint master’s programme is to be found in the
aim of Frontex to develop common European learning standards for border guard officers (common core
curricula), and the necessity to create frameworks for
engaging law enforcement officers in various forms
of exchange and mobility programmes and to contribute to the development of a common culture and
common approach to European border security, in accordance with Frontex’s mandate in the field of border guard training.

National University for Distance-Learning
Education (UNED), Spain
The National Distance Education University (UNED)
has as its mission the public service of higher education through the modality of distance education.

Facts and figures about the UNED
 With more than 205 000 students, the UNED has
the largest student population in Spain and is one
of the largest universities in Europe.
 Since 1972 the UNED has sought to translate into
action the principle of equal opportunity in access
to higher education through a methodology based
on the principles of distance learning and focused
on the needs of the student.
 The UNED is the leader in the implementation
of cutting edge technologies applied to learning,
with the largest offer of virtual courses in Spain.
 The UNED offers a very wide range of training.
Since its inception the UNED has been an institution
with an international outlook and has made considerable efforts to make its services and educational
offerings available to students abroad. Moreover,
the institution has identified the internationalisation of the university at all levels as one of its principal and strategic objectives. To this end, there has
been a significant commitment to the enhancement
of teaching and research collaborations with other
prestigious institutions through agreements and increased participation in international campuses. In
this regard, new initiatives are being developed to
promote the mobility of UNED students, faculty, research staff and administrative and service personnel (PAS). Likewise, the participation of the university
in international projects for European and international calls is being advanced.

More than 170 existing agreements with institutions
in Europe, Latin America, Asia and Africa.
 12 UNED Centres in 11 countries and 2 officially-approved examination sites.
 Participation in major international academic networks: ICDE, AIESAD, EADTU, EUA, EDEN, etc.
The UNED campus is spread across faculties, colleges
and centres in Madrid and the extensive network of
associated centres throughout Spain and abroad.
Although the UNED is designed so that studying can be
done when and where the student deems appropriate,
significant on-site support is available to students at
the 61 associated centres and the network of more than
of 100 university lecture halls distributed throughout
Spain’s autonomous communities. In addition, there are
12 centres in 11 countries in Europe, America and Africa.
The centres are units of the UNED’s academic structure which serve as support for its educational system.
Every UNED student must be attached to an associated centre. Students can opt for the centre they find
most convenient based on their place of residence or
any other circumstance. The attachment is formalised
upon completion of the registration forms.
The associated centre is the regular channel through
which face-to-face interaction between the university and the student takes place. The associated centre offers on-site tutoring, organises the holding of
examinations, and channels and provides information
on those aspects pertaining to the student’s university activity. It also provides the student with support
facilities such as a library, laboratories and computer
rooms, as well as bookstores to purchase the recommended course preparation materials, including assessments for distance learning.

© Guardia Civil. ORIS & Officer´s Academy

Guardia Civil Officers’ Academy, Spain
Overview and Location
The Guardia Civil Officers’ Academy (AOGC) is the
centre in charge of training those who aspire to be
officers of the Guardia Civil. It is assigned responsibility for commanding and managing the units of
this institution. Professional development courses
are also carried out.
The AOGC is located in Aranjuez, a historical city located southwards from Madrid. Aranjuez is a modern,
well-developed town with excellent connections to
Madrid. The most important architectural work there
is the royal palace, the former summer residence of
the kings of the House of Bourbon.

Direct access: Until July 1950 a Guardia Civil officer’s career was the responsibility of the Spanish
armed forces. From 1951 future Guardia Civil officers were trained at the special academy in Madrid.
In 1981, the special academy moved to Aranjuez (Madrid), its current location. After studying two degree
courses combined with professional training at the
military academy and university centre for defence in
Zaragoza, students join the AOGC and also the Guardia
Civil university centre where, after three more multidisciplinary courses (academic and professional) they
finally graduate and acquire the
rank of lieutenant.

History
The AOGC is the result of an intense process of
changing and updating higher education in the Guardia Civil for over a century. During this time two
training modalities have coexisted: ‘internal promotion’ and ‘direct access’ which are carried out at
different centres.
Internal promotion: This modality allows non-commissioned officer to obtain the rank of officer. Since
the first officer college was founded in Getafe (Madrid) in 1894, there have been different centres, names
and locations. The last training centre was the promotion centre in San Lorenzo de El Escorial (Madrid)
from 1989 until 1999, when it became a section of
the current AOGC.

Commitment to Excellence

Collaborations

Aware of the great responsibility that higher education is, the AOGC seeks excellence in the training of those who have to perform important duties
within the Guardia Civil structure. The AOGC has
obtained various quality certifications for excellence in training, event management, knowledge
and research.

The AOGC also actively cooperates with other education and training institutions at national and international levels. It also offers additional places to
students from other countries (mainly from Europe,
Africa and America).

In this context, the mission, vision and values are
fundamental.
Mission: Provide comprehensive training for future
officers of the Guardia Civil which enables them to
perform their task efficiently and to exercise their
functions in higher positions.

A remarkable cooperation, which has been really productive for many years, is the collaboration with the
UNED university. This cooperation covers fields of
study such as law, management and leadership and
the future European Joint Master’s in Strategic Border Management.

Vision: Be an international benchmark of excellence
in the training of senior police officers, recognised for
its leadership and values.
Values: The AOGC wants to instil in the students the
traditional values of the Guardia Civil: honour, loyalty, dedication, discipline, willingness, and fellowship.
The values that govern our daily activity are:
 respect for the individual;
 compliance with the legal system and loyalty to
the institutions;
 will of self-improvement, adaptability and
innovation;
 efficient resource management;
 respect for the environment.

© University of Salamanca

University of Salamanca, Spain
The university was founded in 1218 by Alphonse IX of
León and is considered to be the oldest of existing
Ibero-American universities. In 1255, Pope Alexander
IV granted the institution the condition of Estudio General, like those in Paris, Bologna, Cambridge and Oxford,
confirming the right of its graduates to teach throughout the Christian world. The University of Salamanca
has nine teaching and administrative campuses in
Avila, Zamora, Béjar and Salamanca, and thus is characterised by a high degree of geographic dispersion.
The university is made up five campuses, six university
diploma schools, sixteen faculties and four associated
centres in the following academic areas: 67 degrees,
65 master’s and 37 PhD programs. The academic areas
are: art and humanities, science, social and legal sciences, health sciences, engineering and architecture.
The University of Salamanca is of medium size, with
30 000 students registered.
The University of Salamanca is outstanding for the
quality of its libraries network. It has a capacity of
5 379 reading places in its libraries, it occupies the
eighth place in the Library Quality Ranking in having more than 1 million books in its holdings and
it is in sixth position regarding its journals and periodicals holdings. In the Library Quality Ranking
(including penetration of the new technologies, infrastructures and resources offered) it occupied the
fifth place among Spanish public universities. Also,
with 1 137 places offered in residence halls, it occupies the fourth position in Spanish public Universities
as regards student accommodation. The University
of Salamanca has always been known for its ability
to attract students from outside its ‘local area’. After Lleida, it is the second university in Spain that has

the most students from outside its local sphere of influence. Forty percent of its new students were born
outside the region of Castile-Leon and this reflects the
steady growth that has taken place over the years.
Another point of to be mentioned is the capacity of
the University of Salamanca to attract foreign students. The numbers of these are especially relevant
when speaking of doctorate degrees, where 14 % of
the doctorate students are from Europe and 35 % from
other countries, especially Ibero-America.
The University of Salamanca is the ninth European university as regards the numbers of Erasmus students
received and it occupies the fifth position amongst
Spanish universities. However, considering the importance of Erasmus students with regard to the size of
the university, these students represent 4.75 %, this
percentage being the highest within the medium and
large public universities.
The University of Salamanca and the Learning and
Developing Division of the National Police Force have
been successfully collaborating for 25 years.
Nature of the collaboration:
 formal courses at the National Police Academy
(Avila);
 seminars;
 development of the curricula;
 supervision of degree dissertations;
 establishment of the examining jury for master’s
degree dissertations;
 academic research;
 curricular research;
 attendance of the National Police Force’s recruitment procedures as a panel member.

National Police Force, Spain
The Spanish National Police Force is a civilian armed
corps which operates in the entire Spanish territory.
It focuses its activity in provincial capital cities and
other major cities. The Spanish National Police Force,
in its current structure and designation is directly
grounded in the 1978 Spanish constitution, where
two basic missions are established: ‘to protect the
free exercise of rights and freedoms and to ensure
public safety and security’.
The Spanish National Police Force has its own training
division, upon which three training centres depend,
two of them located in Madrid and one in the city of
Avila. The centre located in Avila is the National Police School, and is entrusted with the training of police officers and middle management officers up to the
rank of police inspector. In Madrid there is the Higher
Police Studies Centre which is in charge of the training of the remaining higher ranking police officers.
The National Police School is located in Avila, a fortified old town with its Extra-Muros Churches. Avila
was declared World Heritage Site by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) in 1986. It is very close to Madrid, Spain’s
capital, and to other beautiful Castilian cities such as
Segovia, Salamanca and Valladolid.

Additionally, the National Police School has prime
quality facilities, set in 550 000 square metres of
green space, of which 242 000 are built-up areas. It
has modern environmentally-friendly facilities that
range from administrative offices to classrooms and
residence buildings.
The National Police School has been a pioneer in
this sense, embracing high quality international police training as one of its main aims. As a result we
can underline that the National Police School has acquired solid international experience over the years.
Spain believes in the value of such experience, which
has become one of the main trademarks of the National Police School.

The National Police School is located approximately
one hour away from the international airport of Madrid/Barajas — the fourth European airport in terms
of passenger transit — which has direct connections
to many major cities in Europe. The National Police
School will provide free and quick direct transfer from
the National Police School facilities to the airport, and
vice versa, in order to ensure an efficient transport
time for its residents and students.

Prospective
students
The prospective students come from national border guard organisations, and also from other relevant
Frontex partner organisations. The entry requirements establish specific prior experience as a border guard officer (working in a border guard function)
with management/command experience in an operational field and English proficiency.
It is estimated that a range of 30–40 students will participate per iteration, one per institution. Officers will
have a proven ascending career development, an interest in self-improvement and high professional performance. It is important that the future student holds a
key position in the organisation, which will enable the

student to apply and multiply the skills and competences
acquired in the programme within the organisation.
The decision to apply for the programme should be
thoroughly assessed and determined by the sending border guard organisation. Consequently, it is
expected that the sending organisations will support the students’ learning throughout the programme, especially as the study period will be very
intense, requiring a number of individual and group
assignments and constant engagement in the learning process.

The European Joint
Master’s in Strategic
Border Management
This European Joint Masters in Strategic Border
Management constitutes 90 European Credit
Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS) credits. (One ECTS credit reflects 28 hours of student
learning activity directly related to the programme
outcomes.) It is delivered over three stages. Each
stage represents one semester of full-time study,
carrying 30 ECTS credits. Stages 1 and 2 contain the
taught component of the programme and stage
3 is comprised solely of a dissertation. The programme also incorporates an experiential learning
element which is applied in the operational context
and takes place after intensive contact sessions.

dents move to a new location for the contact
week of every module and spend the intermediate time (typically 2 weeks) between contact
weeks at their home base. In order to ensure that
students entering this phase of the programme
are all at the same level, students are requested
to read the preparatory material listed in the description of each module.

The first year of the programme consists of 10
modules. Every module comprises a contact period of 1 week (modules 1 to 8) or 2 weeks (modules 9 and 10) which are delivered at the different
institutions of the consortium, meaning that stu-

Upon graduation, the students are awarded a
joint diploma of a European Joint Master’s in
Strategic Border Management that is signed by
all the academic partners and recognised as a
master’s degree internationally.

The dissertation, which is planned during the
third semester, is meant to be the keystone experience which requires students to synthesise the depth of learning from the programme.

31

Stage 1
Stage 1 comprises six modules as follows.
� Strategy, planning and evaluation in border guarding (5 ECTS credits)
� Fundamental rights and ethics in European border security management (5 ECTS credits)
� Leadership and organisational development in border management (5 ECTS credits)
� EU borders policy and strategies (5 ECTS credits)
� Innovation and technology in border security (5 ECTS credits)
� Researching management practices in border security (5 ECTS credits)

Strategy, planning and evaluation in border guarding
is designed to develop strategic thinking skills in order
to implement and evaluate plans at EU and regional
level. As a foundation to the subsequent modules of the
master’s, this module aims to develop border guarding
strategies and implementation plans, evaluate the effectiveness of strategic plans and review in the context
of national and EU requirements. The operational and
tactical experience of students combined with competences developed during the formal learning will
contribute to the development of strategies and implementation plans.

Module 1: Strategy,
planning and evaluation
in border guarding

Module 2: Fundamental rights and ethics in
European border security management
Fundamental rights and ethics is designed to develop
skills in respecting, promoting, fulfilling and integration of fundamental rights and ethics when taking
strategic decisions and considering their implications
in border management at a leadership level. This is
one of the foundation modules for the whole master’s
programme. It will build on the knowledge and skills
acquired from module 1 Strategy, planning and evaluation and set the basis for the subsequent modules.

Fundamental rights and ethics are integral to every
aspect of border guarding learning and practice. The
learner will obtain knowledge of fundamental rights
and ethics as reflected in relative legal framework as
well as emanating from case law. The module will enable the students to make strategic decisions as well
as to review current institutional structures and policies in a manner that is respectful of fundamental
rights and ethics.

32

Module 3: Leadership and organisational
development in border management
Leadership and organisational development focuses
on the enhancement and further development of
leadership and organisational competencies to; introduce change management procedures, promote
fundamental rights and implement strategic planning. Border guard organisations have to be able to
adjust their own organisational structures, procedures
and practices (organisational development), border
guard managers have to manage and lead organi-

sational changes (leadership), and all border guard
professionals have to be ready to accept and implement organisational changes. The module provides
theoretical and practical frameworks with the aim of
equipping students for their role as change agents.
All border guard organisations have to be responsive
to the common EU frameworks, policies, strategies,
standards and also to the operational challenges they
face in daily work.

EU border policies and strategies builds on the preceding modules. It takes the broad European perspective
on policies and strategies. This module is designed to
engage the students in EU border security policies,
strategies and safety procedures, including resource
management and strategic integration of fundamental
rights. It will enable their organisations to be responsive to the common EU frameworks, policies, strategies, standards and also to the operational challenges
they face in daily work. The module provides theoretical and practical frameworks with the aim of equipping students with competencies in their application
to a broad range of concepts and tools to implement,
review, and improve EU strategies.

Module 5: Innovation
and technology in border
security
Innovation and technology is designed to build on the
Strategic planning and evaluation and the Fundamental
rights and ethics modules by delivering theoretical and
practical elements required for strategically managing
technological solutions within the domain of international border control and the European and national
contexts. It addresses all relevant standards on legal
and fundamental rights relating to the use of technology in border management. It also builds awareness
of the emerging trends in technology and skills which
can deliver the greatest benefits when integrated into
their current solutions.

Module 6: Researching
management practices
in border security
Researching management practices in border security is the keystone module of this first phase. This research model brings together the academic principles
of the programme. It is designed to develop skills in applying scientific methodologies and evaluation skills to
the knowledge from previous modules. It is also linked
to and is developed further in Module 10 — Integrated
research practices.

34

Stage 2
Stage 2 comprises four modules as follows:
� The global context of European border security (5 ECTS)
� Strategic risk and threat management for European border security (5 ECTS)
� Cooperation in strategic border management (10 ECTS)
� Researching integrated practices in border management (10 ECTS)

Module 7: The global
context of European
border security

Strategic risk and threat management will draw
on and strengthen the learning from module 1 —
Strategy, planning and evaluation, module 6 — Researching management practices in border security
and module 7 — The global context of European
border Security and from experiential learning to
identify risk and develop risk management tools
and strategies. It is designed to develop knowledge
and skills in intelligence-driven risk and threat analysis and evaluation and review of strategic plans
in relation to strategic risk management.

The global context of European border security
takes a broad perspective of global events that impact on border security. The focus of this module is
on the implications of global international relations,
politics and security issues related to the security
of the EU and, more specifically, on the security of
its borders. The module is designed to equip students with knowledge that will assist the border
manager to reflect on these issues and take decisions in order to prioritise the constantly changing
dynamics and needs of EU borders. In this way it
consolidates the knowledge from the modules in
stage 1. In particular, Strategy, planning and evaluation in border guarding, Fundamental rights and
ethics and leadership and Organisational development in border management.

Cooperation in strategic border management is designed to strengthen and facilitate the decision-making processes in an international context. It delivers
theoretical and best practice knowledge and skills to
enable a more effective cooperation among all the key
actors, Member States, Schengen associated countries
and their involved agencies, institutions and bodies.

Module 9: Cooperation
in strategic border
management

Module 10: Researching integrated practices in
border management
Researching integrated practices in border management is the keystone module designed to provide
an opportunity for learners to integrate the learning attained in the preceding modules. This module
is designed to develop knowledge and skills in qualitative methods of inquiry such as analysing national
and global trends or defining risks and possible challenges for a border management organisation in relation to the constantly changing external context. It
will enable students to select cost effective methodologies and analyse data in order to identify national
and global trends or to define risks and challenges. It

also prepares the students to conduct a review and
case study research into an operationally relevant subject and to develop a detailed research design report.
Collectively, these ten modules will enable border
guard organisations to be responsive to the common EU frameworks, policies, strategies, standards
and to the operational challenges they face. They will
enhance interoperability at EU borders and harmonisation of professional standards whilst promoting
respect for diversity of Member State border guard
organisations.

Stage 3
Stage 3 — Dissertation

© iStockphoto

This stage provides students an opportunity to demonstrate their ability to work independently
on a well-defined problem in a coherent, well-organised and critical manner.

The dissertation themes are drawn from the topics
proposed by the Member States/Schengen associated countries and relevant Frontex business units
that fill the gaps in research areas and innovation in
strategic border management.
The purpose of this dissertation is to develop the ability draw on disciplinary literature to synthesise a research topic and/or to select, interpret and apply a
methodology-sound research approach suitable to

the chosen field. The completion of the dissertation
will enhance the students’ ability to reflect on their
own and their organisation’s practice with reference
to international research in the area. Students will develop critical awareness of previous work in the chosen field and contribute to knowledge by exploring or
modifying some additional areas. They will be able to
present and critique their work in a clear, structured
style, using logical argument.
