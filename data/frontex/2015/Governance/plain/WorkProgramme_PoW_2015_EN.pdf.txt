Executive Summary
The Programme of Work is Frontex’ operative plan.
It describes the key business areas and proposes the activities that should be carried out to achieve the
objectives and long term goals as agreed in Frontex’ Strategy and Multi Annual Plan.

Introduction
The first (general) part of the document starts with an Introduction and the Environmental Scanning
which briefly touches on external factors of Frontex’ societal and task environment. It continues with an
outline of Frontex’ Mission, Vision and Values and elaborates briefly on methodological aspects
considered during the drafting and elaboration of the document. After a short explanation on risk and
activity based management the chapter continues with an elaboration on Operational Risks encountered
and Mitigation measures proposed which are summarised in the Risk Matrix. The first part finalises with
a more detailed elaboration on corporate and governance issues such as corporate risks and mitigation,
governance of performance, prioritisation and financial and human resources needed to implement
the suggested activities.
As indicated by the heading, this chapter is required to be read regardless of the perspective the reader
would prefer to take for the rest of the document.
The second part of the document (Strategic Goals and Key Objectives for 2015) links the Programme of
Work with Frontex’ Strategy and Multi Annual Plan. In this part all activities for 2015 are grouped and
elaborated in two ways:



Firstly by goal/key objective and priority criteria (including details on human resources) and
Secondly by business area (including details on financial resources).

Most important trends and priorities (e.g. Eurosur, the further development and establishment of a
flexible /re-deployable reaction capacity, further development and implementation of new tasks
including detecting, preventing and combating cross border crime) are elaborated separately. Before
turning towards the goals and related implementation measures of the different business areas a brief
overview on budget allocations (using activity based budgeting) is given.
The next chapter shows how human resources are allocated to outcomes to be delivered and grouped
under the six goals and related key objectives of Frontex.
The closing chapter allocates financial resources to certain activities and concepts which follow a
functional approach in line with the organisational structure of Frontex.
The third part consists of a number of annexes (Annex 1 – Annex 4).
Annex 1 provides an organisational chart also including the number of human resources assigned to certain
functions;
Annex 2 will provide an overview of procurement procedures to be carried out during 2015;
Annex 3 elaborates on the Training Plan – Training Portfolio for 2015;
Annex 4 outlines the Plan of Operations for 2015 ();
Page 4 of 138

Annex 3 and 4 will be used by the Schengen Associated Countries (SAC) to execute their voting rights.
Regarding Annex 4 the voting rights of the SAC are limited to activities with their involvement or impacting
on them.
Annex 4 has been marked as Frontex Non Classified Sensitive – Basic Protection Level - releasable to the
Management Board, due to its sensitive content, the disclosure of which would jeopardise and harm the
success of MS driven and supported operational activities coordinated by Frontex.

Approaches and Priorities
During 2015 Frontex will continue to pursue two approaches when carrying out operational activities
(applicable to all types of borders), namely:
Operational activities will be platform based (multipurpose operations serve as a permanent
platform for providing sustaining operational presence and information exchange/gathering)
and
with sustained flexibility (flexible cooperation frameworks enabling MS/SAC to increase
situational awareness, response, and interoperability);
Geographically and/or topical the focus of those operational activities will remain on





Eastern, South Eastern and Western Balkan areas
Easter Europe, and
Identified Eastern, Central, Western Mediterranean regions migratory routes and Atlantic Ocean
Further developing cooperation with non-EU Countries and with EU Agencies and International
Organisations (e.g. Europol, FRA, Interpol, UNHCR, IOM);

Compared to previous years the following issues will drive further changes to the structure and allocation
of resources reflected in the annual programme of work:











the further implementation and consolidated use of the EUROSUR framework by both the
Member States and Frontex;
the further development and establishment of a flexible/re-deployable reaction capacity;
the development of the European Border Guard Teams (EBGT) and the enhancement of the
Technical Equipment Pool (TEP) – forming core elements of Frontex’ flexible reaction
capacity;
the further development and implementation of new tasks including detecting, preventing
and combating cross border crime;
contributions to the development of operational capacities focusing on European Research
Programmes (Horizon 2020);
enhancing the capacities of the border guard community with specialized training including
training on fundamental rights;
the increased role to coordinate EU funding for border management and internal security
related matters;
the implementation of the EU Policy Cycle Operational Action Plans;
the implementation of capacity building projects in Third Countries; and
consolidation after the removal of the Agency to the new headquarter

The Programme of Work 2015 shows in total 316 staff members (151 TA, 87 CA and 78 SNEs).

The conventionally calculated ratio between administrative and operational expenditure will be at the
level of 28 to 72 %. The application of Activity Based Management and Budgeting shows that a significant
share of Title 1 and Title 2 expenditures can be directly related to operational activities. This also leads
to a shift in the ratio of operational/administrative expenditures from 72/28 to 84/16.

Following Frontex’ Strategy, the largest part of Frontex’ budget is allocated to Joint Operations. This to
further improve the capabilities of Member States to tackle demanding situations and also to enhance
Frontex’ capabilities and effectiveness in coordinating the operational activities of the Member States and
Schengen Associated Countries.
Risk analysis will enable better focusing on the main routes of irregular migration and the enhancement
of the impact of border management on fighting crime at the external borders.

Supporting Operational Activities

TOTAL OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES

An amount of 9.2 M EUR (+0.1 M EUR) will be allocated to Joint Operations and Pilot Projects at Land
Borders to tackle irregular migration flows and to enhance the impact on crime fighting at the EU’s
external borders by targeting the Eastern Mediterranean and Balkan routes as well as Eastern routes where
appropriate.
With an allocated amount of 31.1 M EUR (+10.1 M EUR) Joint Operations and Pilot Projects at Sea Borders
will be the recipient of the biggest share of Frontex budget allocations. Strengthening the Member States’
operational capacity to cover increased operational areas and implementation periods will enhance the
tackling of irregular migration flows on routes identified by risk analysis.
Air Borders will have a budget of 2.5 M EUR for the further implementation of a flexible approach to
fluctuations in the phenomena of irregular migration and crime fighting mainly by utilising Focal Points at
various airports to be identified by risk analysis.
Return Operations will carry out their capacity building activities and maintain their support for Member
States and SACs organising joint return operations. A budget of 9.5 M EUR will be made available.
Within the Operations Division a certain percentage of the financial means allocated to units and sectors
of the division is earmarked (internal operational reserve). In addition to that an amount of 10.0 M EUR
will be made available for operational contingency to cover activities in case of reprioritisation or
enhancements due to unforeseeable changes to the migration situation/risks.
Risk Analysis will provide strategic analytical products and related advice as well as operational and
tactical analytical products to internal and external stakeholders in a timely manner. A budget of 2.0 M
EUR (+0.6 M EUR) will be made available to increase the number but also to improve the quality of
products and services.
Frontex Situation Centre (FSC) will maintain situational awareness, support risk analysis and assist
emergency/crisis management processes (0.5 M EUR);

Page 8 of 138

To fully operationalise Eurosur an overall amount of 9.3 M EUR (+5.3 M EUR) will be allocated. This
amount is split over two main areas, namely Information Management (7.0 M EUR) and Information
Technology (2.3 M EUR).
In 2015 Research & Development activities will have a budget of 0.85 M EUR to drive the process of the
harmonisation of border control and the development of standards - both operational and technical.
During 2015, the emphasis of Training activities will be on the development and provision of common
standards for general trainings (e.g. CCC, CML, and EBGT) with a reduction of specialized training per se.
A budget of 4.4 M € (+0.4 M EUR) will be made available for different activities.
With a budget of 1.4 M EUR (+0.4 M EUR) Pooled Resources will manage and further develop the European
Border Guard Teams and Technical Equipment Pools.

1 General Part
1.1

Introduction

The first (general) part links Frontex’ Strategy and the concrete activities (presented in the second part).
It depicts the environment and shows the allocation of human and financial resources. It also explains the
criteria for prioritisation of activities. An important element of the general part is to illustrate what
measures will be taken to mitigate risks and to achieve the objectives in the light of key performance
indicators.
The second part contains a prioritised list of activities, broken down by business areas of the agency. This
serves the purpose of Activity Based Management (ABM) and Activity Based Budgeting (ABB) as each activity
is presented with a description of expected outcome and with the allocation of both, human and financial
resources. At the current stage some of the figures ‘double count’ human resources which will be
corrected in the final version.

1.2

Environment Scanning

Frontex acts in an environment, impacted upon by political, economical, social, technological, legal and
environmental factors.
This section outlines the factors that might directly or indirectly have an impact on the implementation
of the proposed Programme of Work.
Environmental scanning is an ongoing process that could lead to changes to Frontex’ activities. More
detailed findings are contained in analytical products such as the Annual and Semi-annual Risk
Assessments, but also in quarterly reports such as the FRAN quarterlies and Tailored Risk Assessments.

Mission, Vision and Values

Mission
Frontex supports, coordinates and develops European border management in line with the Charter of
Fundamental Rights of the EU and other international obligations.
Frontex supports the Member States 1 (MS) to achieve an efficient, high and uniform level of border
control.
Frontex coordinates operational and EU measures to jointly respond to exceptional situations at the
external borders.
Frontex develops capacities at the Member State and European level as combined instruments to tackle
challenges of migration flows, and the fight against serious organised crime and terrorism at the external
borders

and Justice by supporting the Member States to keep up with their responsibilities.

Vision
Frontex applies the concept of Integrated Border Management and promotes a European border culture
based on the full respect, protection and promotion of fundamental rights.
Frontex applies the concept of Integrated Border Management with a balanced focus on effective border
control and fight against serious crime. The agency uses effectively all means including enhanced
interagency cooperation and cooperation with Non EU countries to fulfil its remit.
Frontex promotes the European border guard culture with the full respect and promotion of fundamental
rights as an integral element. Special focus is applied to the right to asylum and international protection
and the principle of non refoulement.

Professional staff and a set of operational and administrative capabilities enable Frontex to add value to
the European Union.

Values
Within a team-work focused framework,
enabled by open communication, Frontex’
staff members share and live the corporate
values. Consequently, they perform their
activities in a highly professional way.
Humanity links Frontex’ activities with the
full respect, protection and promotion of
fundamental rights as an unconditional
and integral component of effective
integrated border management resulting
in trust in Frontex.

1.4

Methodology

The Programme of Work is prepared through the corporate planning cycle, respecting the deadlines of
Frontex regulation. Certain activities of Frontex contribute to the EU Policy Cycle, focusing on the
priorities of the EU Internal Security Strategy.
In line with the corporate planning cycle, Frontex’ programme of work develops iteratively. This allows
increasing the level of detail constantly, and adapting the document as assessments of operational risk
levels change during the current year. Consequently, also the basic elements of the plan of operations
and training activities are to be further developed during the Corporate Planning Meeting (beginning of
May) and further detailed and agreed upon during the Annual Bilateral Talks (September/October).
Frontex applies a Goal and Priority oriented approach. The six Goals of Frontex (Situational Awareness,
Supporting Response, Emergency Response, Development, Organisation and Staff) give strategic direction
to the agency. There is no prioritisation between the goals. Instead, the key objectives of each Goal (as
described in Frontex Strategy and the Multi-Annual Plan) and the activities in this Programme of Work are
prioritised.

1.5

Risk and Activity Based Management

Frontex strives to improve its performance by implementing quality and risk management measures and
managerial measures shown by the achievement of key performance indicators at all organisational
levels.
Risk management is a continuous process applied by the senior management to mitigate the corporate
risks.
Frontex will apply Activity Based Management (ABM) and Activity Based Budgeting (ABB), in line with
the recommendation of the Joint Statement of the European Commission, Council and the European
Parliament of July 2012. This allows to directly allocated costs to be accounted in Title 1 and 2 to
operational activities, products and services. At the current stage only costs related to human resources
have been allocated by creating a limited number to types of cost centers.

1.6

Operational Risk and Risk Mitigation

This chapter reviews the possible evolution of the situation along the external borders of the EU in the
coming years. Further and more detailed information also covering the possible and unknown will be
available in Frontex’ Annual Risk Analysis 2015.

1.6.1

The Likely

The best forecasts – those likely to materialise and have a direct bearing on the situation at the external
borders – are the continued use of the Mediterranean area as the main crossing points for irregular
migration, and the growing workload of border control authorities due to growth of passenger numbers and
the further roll-out of compulsory biometric checks on VIS Schengen visa holders. At the same time, bordercontrol authorities are increasingly expected to be engaged in border surveillance activities and search and
rescue operations covering vast areas of the Mediterranean Sea, as well as being the first interlocutors for
a growing number of persons presenting themselves at the EU borders in search of international protection.
The budget environment is expected to remain tight over the next few years.

Illegal border-crossing expected to remain concentrated in southern and south-eastern
borders of the EU and at the Hungarian external land border with Serbia
Based on the location of the main countries of origin for irregular migration to the EU over the past five
years, the border areas that are most likely to deal with illegal border-crossings remain the southern
Mediterranean coast, and the borders with Turkey. Migrants living in or having relatively easy access to
Turkey and / or North Africa will continue to be overrepresented in the flow of irregular migrants to the EU.
In particular, departures of sub-Saharan migrants from Libya across the Central Mediterranean to reach
Italy and arrivals of Syrians crossing the border illegally to apply for asylum in the EU – two phenomena
already present in 2014 – are likely to continue in the near future.
Southern Mediterranean area
On the Eastern Mediterranean route, enhanced surveillance along the Greek and Bulgarian land borders
with Turkey has resulted in a displacement of irregular migrants to the Eastern Aegean Sea. As a result,
growing irregular migratory flows at the Greek sea border are expected to put pressure on local reception
facilities for undocumented irregular migrants, and demands increased allocation of resources for search
and rescue operations, as well as increase the possibility of migrants travelling undetected mainly across
the Western Balkans towards Western European Member States.
The Bulgarian authorities continue to expand the IBSS and have increased their border control activities.
Therefore, migrants continue to consider crossing illegally the land border between Turkey and Greece as
an option to reach their final destination in the EU. Among those migrants, Syrians and Iraqi Kurds and
Christians are the most vulnerable due to the expansion of IS and the likelihood of humanitarian crisis at
the EU border will remain significant until the situation in Syria and Northern Iraq improves. The ability of
MS authorities to provide consistent and timely measures and actions will be crucial for coping with security
and humanitarian risks.
It has been increasingly reported that boats with irregular migrants are taking routes from Turkey to Italy.
In some cases these boats have picked up migrants on smaller vessels from the Syrian or Egyptian coast
before continuing the long journey across the Mediterranean Sea. In contrast, there have been a small but
increasing number of detections of boats transporting migrants from Turkey to Romania across the Black
Sea.
In addition, an increasing number of migrants from North Africa and the Middle East are expected to
arrive in to Turkey via the air borders, before attempting to cross illegally the border to the EU,
including through the use of forged documents. Istanbul airport (IST) is an important hub for irregular
migrants travelling by air route to several Member States, with continuous increase in passenger flows
for the past several years and expanding strategy of Turkish Airlines towards Africa and the Middle
East. Turkish airports are thus likely to remain common departure points for irregular migrants arriving
in the EU.

Page 13 of 138

Western Balkans
Over the past two years, the EU’s external borders with the Western Balkan region emerged as one of the
main entry points for irregular migrants into the EU/SAC area, being largely influenced by secondary
movements along the Eastern Mediterranean route and also by the visa and asylum policy of member states
towards Western Balkan countries. In 2014, the vast majority of migrants were detected at the HungarianSerbian border, indicating that similar to last year, Hungary remains the main transit country for migrants
travelling across the Western Balkan region to EU destination countries.
Central Mediterranean area
In the Central Mediterranean, many areas on the North African coast may be used as departure points for
illegal border-crossings to the EU. Throughout 2014, departures from Libya increased, but Egypt and Tunisia
also offered crossing options for would-be migrants. North African countries may be used as transit countries
for migrants from sub-Saharan African countries to sail across the Mediterranean Sea. These North African
countries may be used as a transit region by migrants from many different origins, which complicates
further predictions in terms of volume.
The increasing detections of illegal border-crossings in the Central Mediterranean, along with the
increasing complexity of irregular arrivals are expected to absorb a significant proportion of resources.
The large number of boats seeking assistance, results in Member States’ assets being increasingly
mobilised and engaged in maritime surveillance and in support of s earch and rescues activities.

Increased workload at the border
Regular passenger flows across the external borders will increase significantly in the coming years due to
rising global mobility. Visa liberalisation processes and local border traffic agreements are placing also
increasing responsibilities on border-control authorities.
Air travel environment is becoming more complex with the growth of low-cost carriers. In addition,
advances in travel complexity and increasing sophistication of criminal activities result in increasing
workload for border-control officers and increasing difficulties in developing passenger risk assessments.
Moreover, document fraud committed by migrants illegally entering the EU will maintain pressure on EU
border authorities. The phenomenon of EU foreign fighters travelling to and returning from Syria and Iraq
constitute an additional challenge to Member States border-control officers.
In addition, the EU continues to receive a high number of asylum seekers. A substantial number of economic
migrants appear to use the asylum procedure to enter or stay on the territory of the EU. Their first
interlocutors are often border control authorities. According to a new EU Asylum Directive, which is to be
enacted into national law by 26 June 2015, border authorities are obliged to proactively inform persons in
need of international protection of their rights and refer them to the competent authorities. Thus, Member
States need to develop their procedures accordingly and train border guards to correctly implement them.

VIS implemented at BCPs in October 2014
From October 2014, all Schengen Member States were required to carry out VIS fingerprint verifications at
all BCPs and also to issue VIS visas with biometrics at the border when necessary. Thus, the workload for
border-control authorities has, and will continue to increase significantly. Based on available statistics on
Schengen visas issued in 2012, and assuming that in 2015, further VIS rollout will take place in Regions 18
to 23, including in the Russian Federation, China and Turkey, the number of VIS visas issued each month
is estimated at about 1.2 million. This estimate does not take into account passengers travelling on
multiple entry visas, who can cross the border several times within a six-month period.
The Schengen Borders Code does not currently impose mandatory consultation of the VIS on exit. However,
a thorough check on exit comprises, among other things, verification that the person is in possession of a
valid visa, if required, and it may include consultation with the VIS in accordance with Article 18 of the VIS
Regulation.
It is important to stress that VIS is a tool for border guards, but the VIS result alone is not sufficient to
refuse entry. When an issue is spotted during first-line checks, passengers must still be sent to second-line
checks for additional verification and final decision.
Page 14 of 138

Budget environment
The economic crisis led to reductions in public funding in many Member States and at EU level. These
reductions have already impacted several border-control agencies and significant annual savings are to be
expected over future budgets, which has an impact on the capability and capacity to respond to challenges
faced at the external borders.

Factors impacting on the management of the Agency

Corporate Risks and Mitigation
Each year the Corporate Planning Process is executed; once the Programme of Work is near finalisation
the top corporate-level risks are identified by senior management. These risks are monitored and
mitigated throughout the year and reported to the Management Board via the quarterly reports as may be
needed.

Corporate –Level Risks
Risk & Risk Description

Risk
Significance
(H/M/L)

1. Reduced Political Support & Independence
Cause: A heightened interest from other entities can result in Frontex not being
consulted or invited to meetings where expert voice should be heard, e.g. Council
working parties, EC meetings;
Potential Consequences: This may result in legislation or instructions which
negatively impact on our ability to achieve our mission;
Generic Mitigation measures: Reduce: 1. Identify key meetings, working parties,
etc. & take action to be included.

H

Reduced Independence:
Cause: Heightened political interest can negatively impact our ability to maintain
independence as specified in the regulation.
Potential Consequences: Sub-optimal decisions that may not be cost-effective or
not in the interest of our stakeholders.
Generic Mitigation Measures (Response): Reduce: monitoring events & identifying
trends then taking appropriate action.
2. Various & Unbalanced Stakeholder Expectations that do not align with the
Programme of Work

Page 17 of 138

Cause: Macro changes such as shifts in migration pressure can result in increased
stakeholder expectations. Additionally, Frontex’ stakeholders have different &
often competing expectations for our products & services (some expectations are
not made tangible). Even though the PoW & MAP are approved by MB, expectations
can change.

H

Potential Consequences: Such changes may not be aligned with the approved PoW
& may result in: increased workload; jeopardising the timely delivery of products &
services; reduced quality of products & services; decreased satisfaction of
stakeholders; reduced staff morale.
Generic mitigation measures (Response): Reduce: 1. Repetition & focus on core
message (focus on products & services in the PoW); 2. When required, changes are
made to PoW de-prioritise others; 3. Monitoring events & identifying trends then
taking appropriate action
3. Suboptimal use of human & financial resources
Cause: lack of ABM; inability to ensure there is no double funding related to our
activities with other EU funding sources; ex-post controls not fully implemented yet;
Insufficient “evaluation culture” & inadequate processes & tools; Process
Management not used as a management tool; Business Continuity Management
needs further development; Collegial work environment needs strengthening in line
with the values; cross-organisational cooperation still not fully leveraged.

M

Potential Consequences: negative impact on: efficiency; credibility with
stakeholders; staff morale; ability to systematically identify & implement
improvement actions.
Generic mitigation measures (Response): Reduce: 1. Continue work in each of these
areas & monitoring their completion & effectiveness in mitigating the risks; 2.
Monitor relevant events & take mitigating actions
4. Reputational Damage
Cause: Events/incidents related to our activities; Misunderstanding of our role &
activities, e.g. EUROSUR; Public & other stakeholders misunderstanding of our role
(including fundamental rights - highly political & sensitive, roles & responsibilities
not clear).
Potential Consequences: Loss of credibility resulting in marginalisation; loss of
political support impacting our ability to perform our function; “Reactive mode”
causing inefficiency; negative impact on staff morale.

H

Generic mitigation measures (Response): Reduce: 1. Continue to sharpen &
communicate our core messages; 2. Improve support & use of the liaison function
in Brussels. 3. Monitor events & take mitigating actions

Steering in the light of selected governance indicators

Page 18 of 138

1) In 2015 the number of Member States participating in operational activities should remain at the same
level as in 2014. This will be achieved by marketing the short and long term benefits of Frontex coordinated
activities over direct contributions to hosting Member States.
Participation Index = 25 (average)
2) Guest officers deployed in Frontex coordinated activities in general are part of European Border Guard
Teams. The refinement and agreement on different profiles of border guards – based on experiences made
since the establishment of the teams - should ensure that the use of the pool should further increase
compared to 2014.
Pool Utilization Index_HR = 98%
3) The use of Operational Plans and the experiences gained over the last years leading to a simplification
should allow Frontex to keep the ratio for the implementation of operational plans at the same level as
in 2014.
Utilisation of Operational Plan HR and TE = 90%
4) Timely delivery of Frontex’ products and services will be maintained at the 2014 level. This will be
achieved by steering and monitoring of external contributions increasing timeliness and quality.
Timeliness of external contributions= 85%
Timeliness Index = 100%
5) The increased focus on the quality of Frontex’ products and services should result in raising the level
of customer satisfaction by 0.1 points.
Satisfaction Level = 4.3 (average)
6) The Technical Equipment Pool (TEP) established should serve as the main source for MSs’ technical
equipment deployed in operational activities. Based on a gap analysis this pool will be completed with the
acquisition of Frontex’ own equipment (e.g. services, leasing, joint procurement).
Pool Utilisatoin Index_TE=85%

Priority principles

Linking of criteria for prioritisation to Frontex’ goals
For 2015, in line with the goals established in Frontex’ Strategy (Multi Annual Plan 2015 – 2018), the
following set of criteria will apply to identify priorities:







To comply with specific legal obligations, key EU objectives and Frontex’ mission/values and
guarantee that all tasks of the agency are fulfilled;
aim at the most cost-efficient use of Frontex human and financial resources;
to safeguard an adequate response to operational needs at the external borders;
to support those Member States under constant high pressure and maintain the core
infrastructure for operational cooperation and activities that maintain the positive status quo;
have considerable impact on the Member States’ capabilities on border control;
to contribute to the long-term and short-term development of Member States’ capabilities;

activities to maintain core infrastructure for

activities to maintain the ‘status quo’;
activities building long-term capacity of
stakeholders;
activities building short-term capacity of
stakeholders;
activities to implement activity based
management (ABM) and activity based
budgeting (ABB) aiming at improving overall
performance to align Frontex’ products and
services to stakeholders needs;
aactivities promoting knowledge and
understanding on the respect, protection and
promotion of fundamental rights within
Frontex staff

These priorities can be superseded by emergent needs due to unforeseen developments – (GOAL
‘Emergency Response’).
It is important to highlight that the terms used are also understood in their capacity building dimension.

1.9

Operational Contingency Plan

Experiences made since 2010 showed that even most careful budgeting and application of administrative
mechanism are not sufficient to respond appropriately to major shifts in trends of the migratory streams.
Thus it is suggested to create – besides internal measures that aim at using resources in a flexible way to
cover emerging needs - an Operational Contingency Package for 2015.
As an element of Frontex’ operational reaction capacity to emergent needs, based on Risk Analysis
conclusions and recommendations, this package shall allow to cover exceptional situations,
extended/enforced joint operations at sea, land, and air borders, further activities elevating return
related actions, and other operational activities within the remit of Frontex’ to remedy the situation.
At this moment, and under the assumption that the current situation in Central Mediterranean area will
persists, it is intended that a relevant amount of a contingency package will be used to upgrade the level
of support in the region (e.g. Joint Operation EPN Triton). Also reinforcement of the support provided to
the Eastern Mediterranean Sea Borders might be recommended, if the high numbers of detections will
remain.
Uncertainty of the situation at the Eastern Land Borders will require constant monitoring. Any changes
(verified and validated) encountered in this border sectors might require an exceptional operational
activity coordinated by Frontex, and therefore will trigger the use of budget allocated to the contingency
package.

2.1

Priorities and Trends
In the Programme of Work all activities for 2015 are grouped and elaborated



by business area and
by priority criteria

In 2015 the biggest changes will derive from











the further implementation and consolidated use of the EUROSUR framework by both the
Member States and Frontex;
the further development and establishment of a flexible/re-deployable reaction capacity;
the development of the European Border Guard Teams (EBGT) and the enhancement of the
Technical Equipment Pool (TEP) – forming core elements of Frontex’ flexible reaction
capacity;
the further development and implementation of new tasks including detecting, preventing
and combating cross border crime;
contributions to the development of operational capacities focusing on European Research
Programmes (Horizon 2020);
enhancing the capacities of the border guard community with specialised training including
training on fundamental rights;
the increased role to coordinate EU funding for border management and internal security
related matters;
the implementation of the EU Policy Cycle Operational Action Plans;
the implementation of capacity building projects in Third Countries; and
consolidation after the removal of the Agency to the new headquarter

Eurosur
In 2015 the importance of EUROSUR as a common framework for the exchange of information and
for the cooperation between Member States and between Member States and Frontex in order to
improve situational awareness and to increase reaction capability at the external borders of the
Member States of the Union will continue to increase.
As main operational priorities, Frontex will continue to

maintain and further develop the European Situational Picture (ESP); also by enhancing the
Common Pre-Frontier Intelligence Picture (CPIP);

coordinate the common application of surveillance tools; and

contribute to coordinated reaction capacity in accordance with Frontex regulation.
This will require

the maintenance and further development of the communication network for EUROSUR and

the assessment of the level of impact on border security from an EU perspective as a
prerequisite.
The services provided by Frontex (in particular the European Situational Picture as well as the
Common Pre-Frontier Intelligence Picture by using the Common Surveillance Tools and other
Page 21 of 138

specifically developed analytical tools) will be further developed and enhanced (including the
possible use of the Copernicus capabilities).
The coherent situational picture will serve as an enabler for an enhanced situational monitoring
and situational awareness. This strengthens the capability for an adequate reaction including the
efficient deployment and tasking of operational assets e.g. in the context of Frontex coordinated
JO’s.

Further development and establishment of a flexible/re-deployable reaction
capacity;
Own equipment
Both the use of Common Surveillance Tools for improved situational awareness, and the improved
operational response capacity following the impact level assessment, underlines the importance
for Frontex to acquire and use particular products, services and technical equipment during
planned operational activities but also to quickly respond to changing demands. This will besides
significantly shortening the response time also allow to use resources (technical and human) in a
more cost efficient way. By further identifying the resources available in MS and possible shortages
(both in quantity and quality) Frontex will bridge those gaps by acquiring the required products,
services and assets, hence providing a clear value added at EU level to support Frontex
coordinated joint operations. This leverage capacity will have multiplying effect in terms of
efficiency at external borders.
Seconded Guest Officers
The further development of Seconded Guest Officers mechanism and enhanced utilisation of SGO’s
will further strengthen Frontex’ response capacity.
EBGT profile training
Training will focus on specific needs of EBGT pool members for carrying out their duties effectively
according to the profile defined for their deployment. It will ensure flexible and updated delivery
according to the situation and envisage direct access to training resources during operation.
Ad-hoc training
Flexible reaction capacity will be enhanced by developing readiness to provide directed ad-hoc
training.

Further development and implementation of new tasks including detecting,
preventing and combating cross border crime
The role of Frontex in implementing tasks is laid down in the Frontex regulation, the Eurosur
regulation, as well as in the “Schengen governance package. They all contain refined and new
tasking for Frontex building on Member States collaboration.
The vulnerability assessment for the purpose of risk analysis (Article 4 of Frontex Regulation) is
a precondition to fully apply the CIRAM. The information generated will allow providing a
mechanism to update the governing body of the Agency on the common and national capacities
to perform border control, together with enhanced engagement of MS reporting and practical
cooperation.
The technical support from Frontex in managing the platform on which MS report indicators on
intra Schengen secondary movements will require further enhancement to sustain the production
of regular analysis. The assessments produced by Frontex should enable sufficient knowledge
linking external border management and intra-Schengen movements.

Page 22 of 138

The Schengen Evaluation Mechanism and Common Rules on Temporary Reintroduction of
Border Control at the Internal Borders affects aspects such as the risk analysis based design of
the multi annual programmes, the risk analysis based annual planning and other aspects of the
Schengen mechanism. By implementing those tasks, Frontex will contribute to the strengthening
and functioning of the Schengen system and related mechanisms.

Contribution to the development of operational capacities focusing on
European Research Programmes (Horizon 2020)
In accordance with its mandate Frontex will contribute to European research activities related to
border security in particular by identifying relevant topics under the Horizon 2020 research
programme. Based on end-user input and aiming at the development of operational capacities,
Frontex will continue to follow up on the execution of those research activities in close
cooperation with the Member States, Commission and other EU Agencies in order to ensure their
continued relevance for the end-user community.

Enhancing the capacities of border guard community with specialised training
and exchange mobility programmes
Frontex training activities will further contribute to building up capacities in Member States
towards having specialized trained professionals to perform border guarding activities. Within the
overall implementation of the European Law Enforcement Training Scheme (LETS); Frontex’
contributions will be supported by the national implementation of common standards for
specialized trainings of border guards. These will be achieved through the development of common
training tools, qualifying national multipliers, specialized trainings for EBGT, exchange and
mobility programmes and use of the most new solutions for effective education and training, hence
contributing to a common European Border Guard Culture.

Increased role to coordinate EU funding for border management and internal
security related matters
The legal framework of the EU provides numerous financial instruments and funds available to the
Member States and also the Agency that could be better utilised for the purpose of border
management and internal security. Midterm oriented efforts and measures will be developed to
better support the Member States in their undertakings to use such funds. This will further lead
to more transparency and a better overview of assets acquired from such funds, and ultimately
increasing of the Technical Equipment Pool by including such assets into the pool.

Implementation of the EU Policy Cycle Operational Action Plans
The EU Policy Cycle, driven by Europol through the European Multidisciplinary Platform against
Criminal Threats (EMPACT), is gaining increasing political visibility. The first full cycle, covering
the period 2014-2017, has identified - based on Europol’s SOCTA to which Frontex contributed nine crime priorities, amongst which also the fight against irregular migration and THB. Frontex is
involved as co-driver for the implementation of the Operational Action Plan against irregular
migration, and progress will be reported directly to the COSI. COSI should closely evaluate the
implementation of EMPACT, including the participation of Agencies in order to ensure commitment
and the required allocation of human and financial resources to the activities.

Page 23 of 138

Capacity building projects in Third Countries
The new provision on Technical Assistance Projects in third countries (Art. 14/5) will enable
operational, institutional and capacity building activities with the competent authorities of
identified third countries/regions. Activities under this provision are to be interlinked with Frontex
core business strengthening security at the EU external borders by building sustainable
partnerships with third countries (e.g. utilisation of LO network, dispatching and exchanging LO
with third countries regions).
Frontex will




Coordinate and implement the EU Funded Eastern Partnership (EaP) – IBM – Capacity
Building Project, to cover the period 2014-2017.
Coordinate and implement the Instrument for Pre-Accession (IPAII) Multi-Country Action
Programme “Regional support to protection-sensitive migration management in the
Western Balkans and Turkey” to cover the period 2015-2018.

This will lead to strengthened third country cooperation; contribute to decreasing the pressure on
the external borders of the EU; strengthen capacity building in the region and invest in preparing
the Western Balkans with their future transition.

Depending on the available human and financial resources, Frontex would possibly start with the
deployment of Liaison Officers to Third Countries, subject to the approval of the strategic and
geographical deployment by the Management Board.Dedicated human resources of respective
units and entities are needed in the preparation as well as implementation phase. Hence,
operational, capacity building as well as administrative and horizontal support services will be
affected by these additional actions under this portfolio. In addition Frontex will strive to promote
cooperation with Union agencies and bodies and international organisations where a clear added
value is given.

Table 4: Breakdown of certain expenditures and trends (2013 - 2015)

The overview shows that the largest part of Frontex’ budget will be allocated to Joint Operations to
further strengthen the Member States’ capabilities. This enables better focusing on the main routes of
irregular migration and enhancing the impact of border management on fighting crime at the external
borders.
The priority given to the further utilisation of the Eurosur framework is reflected in the increased amount
of 9.3 Mio Euros directly allocated to related tasks.
The distribution of financial resources to different types of borders and return operations has to be seen
in connection with the increase of financial resources available for the Eurosur framework. The utilisation
of this framework during 2015 should show impact on the need for and the ability to better tailor
operational activities at sea and land borders.
Investments of 3.8 Mio Euros to update and enhance the ICT infrastructure do not just serve administrative
purposes but will also enhance and facilitate Frontex’ operational activities.
To adapt to a rapid changing environment training activities are reinforced to provide for additional
agility, and to develop ad-hoc solutions in support to increasing operational needs. This covers specialised
training for EBGT members and the development of related courses, as well as new emerging training
needs (e.g. “on scene coordination of search and rescue”). On the basis of a feasibility study launched in
2014, significant efforts will be dedicated to the development of a Training Unit eLearning platform
enabling wide access to training tools and courses.
Overall, the share between operational and administrative expenditures (even when not applying an
activity based approach) will increase to 72÷28 %.
In applying a activity based approach to managing and budgeting it shows that a significant share of
expenditures covered under Title 1 (e.g. salary) and Title 2 (e.g. rental expenditures) can be directly
related to operational activities. For internal calculation, the costs for staff and have been divided into
four categories. For governance purposed it seems sufficient to use an average amount to calculate to
cost of a staff member per year.

Page 27 of 138

The current allocation of staff to certain functions and within that functions to operational products and
services delivered generates a ratio for each function. This ratio is used to differentiate between direct
(operational) and indirect (administrative) costs.

BORDERS (Part
of Focal Points
Concept)(JOU)

In all operational areas, border checks will be
encompassed within the framework of the Focal Points
platform, which will additionally be used for the smooth
integration of the joint teams within the working
procedures and will enable, through the situational
awareness and the established structure of the Focal
Points, an optimal utilization of the deployment of the
JBCTs. Frontex Operational activities at external land
borders contribute to strengthen the Schengen System
by creating the conditions for a more secure external
border.

EPN CONCEPT

interoperability and performance to tackle identified
threats and risks affecting the EU external maritime
borders, to use as a permanent platform for providing
sustaining operational presence and information
exchange/gathering in areas at external borders
exposed to specific and disproportionate pressure – thus
substantially contributing to the situational awareness
according to the Eurosur objectives, to improve gaining
border related intelligence, and to systematically
enhance cooperation and coordination with EU Agencies;
EPN maritime operations contribute to a more secure
control of the external borders by reinforcing MS
capacity, thus supporting the maintenance of a stronger
Schengen System;

PULSAR
CONCEPT

ANNEX 3 – Training Plan – Training Portfolio 2015

This Annex presents Frontex training life cycle, what are the main activity areas (training portfolio) and
core elements on how they will be implemented in 2015 (activity plan).

Background Information
Frontex Training Unit scope of work contributes to the long term mitigation of multiple risks at EU level
through implementation of Common standards for the general education of Border Guards, Common
Standards and Tools for Specialised Training of Border Guards and direct further training, Training for
Members of the European Border Guard Teams, development of new solutions for education and training.

The activities in the field of training for 2015 are set according to the following life cycle:
Needs assessment
-

To develop and implement indicators and methodologies for training needs assessment, with the
involvement of stakeholders as identified.

Development
-

To develop and implement common core curricula focusing on harmonising learning standards for midlevel and high-level border guard training and development of common modular study programmes as
a basis for exchange of border guard students in both academic and vocational training frameworks;

-

To develop training products with further emphasis on common standards and use of modern training
methods.

Implementation
-

To provide advanced training to the members of the European Border Guard Teams (EBGT) 8 pool;

-

To develop an integrated ICT system for training and learning;

Evaluation
-

To assess the activities within the National Training Coordinators’ network.

Frontex training activities are implemented on the basis of the course programmes and curricula designed
through joint efforts of Frontex and experts from Member States/Schengen Associated Countries (MS/SAC)
supported by cooperative agencies and international organisations.
Courses are mainly targeted towards training of multipliers, who carry out national training activities in
their respective home countries, and are often used as the most efficient way to cascade competences to
all MS/SAC. Standardised results in all MS/SAC are ensured through the use of Frontex training tools and
8

Page 121 of 138

through guidelines given to multiplier trainers. With this approach to translate the training products and
to qualify the national multipliers, all Border Guard officers can be trained to the same training standards
in their mother tongue.
Training activities aim at building capacity in three main areas:


Educational standards (Common Core Curricula)



Specialised Training



EBGT Profile Training

In accordance to the Programme of Work 2015, the total estimated budget for training activities in
2015 is 4 400 000 EUR:



1 350 000 EUR for Educational standards (Common Core Curricula)



1 000 000 EUR for specialised Training



1 200 000 EUR for EBGT Profile Training



700 000 EUR for Frontex Training Support Networks and new solutions for education and training



150 000 EUR for Ad-hoc training based on urgent operational needs for enhancing flexible
reaction capacity

Training portfolio
Educational standards (Common Core Curricula)
From basic level up to the Master degree, Common Core Curricula (CCC) for Border Guards constitute a
corner stone in building harmonised competencies within all stages of professional careers.
As a principle, they are based on the Sectoral Qualifications Framework (SQF) for Border Guarding
according to Bologna/Copenhagen principles and the European Qualifications Framework for Lifelong
Learning (EQF), CCC are competence driven, learning outcomes based approach, integrating fundamental
rights in training design as underpinning principles, and promoting the implementation of Bologna and
Copenhagen standards.

SQF for Border Guarding, - Training Standards in Line with Bologna/Copenhagen
Principles
The SQF contributes to the harmonisation of the BG education and training and supports the national
integration of all common curricula, as it offers specific reference points for all border guard learning
requirements, at all levels, consistent and aligned with the European Qualifications Framework for Life
Long Learning. Being specific to the Border Guard sector, the SQF for Border Guarding creates synergies
within the Law Enforcement Training Scheme (LETS) and facilitates inter- agency cooperation and
coordination in the field of law enforcement training.
a) Basic (EQF/SQF level 4 and 5)

Page 122 of 138

Historically this curriculum was the first developed by Frontex and offers measurable common standards
for law enforcement officers in the EU. Implemented by national BG training institutions and teachers for
students in all EU Member States, it encompasses a general part and different modules for sea, air and
land borders operations. The current version was updated in 2012.
b) Mid-level (EQF/SQF level 6)
These sets of modules for mid-level officers are designed to be integrated in the existing national
programmes in a flexible manner so to facilitate the national integration of the common educational
standards developed at European level.
c) High level (EQF/SQF level 7) - European Joint Master’s in Strategic Border Management
This programme supports a strategic integrated approach to border management and foster a common
border guard culture within EU at higher levels. It is a professionally oriented master’s programme where
the learning has a practical application for the border guard organisations which are the ultimate
beneficiary.

Specialised training
Frontex training activities further contribute to building up capacities in Member States towards having
specialised trained professionals to perform border guarding activities. Within the overall implementation
of the Law Enforcement Training Scheme (LETS), Frontex contribution is supported by the national
implementation of common standards for specialised trainings of border guards. This is achieved through
the development of common training tools, qualifying national multipliers, specialized trainings for EBGT,
Erasmus-like mobility programmes and use of the most new solutions for effective education and training,
hence contributing to a common European Border Guard Culture.
Based on Frontex risk analysis, lessons learnt from Frontex coordinated Joint Operations and inputs from
Member States, specialised training offers common training tools in specific areas. They are intended to
be delivered to qualified national multipliers, but can also be organised on ad-hoc basis.
a) Fundamental Rights
This training raises awareness and provides harmonised guidelines on respecting fundamental rights while
performing sometimes complex duties at the borders. This manual is meant to be used by trainers, user
friendly and structured around the core functions of the border guards.
b) Anti-Trafficking in Human Beings
Frontex anti-trafficking trainers’ manual is in line with the latest international and European standards,
emphasising that the fundamental rights of the trafficked person are at the centre of all efforts addressing
trafficking in human beings.
c) Schengen Borders Code
This curriculum is based on a 2014 pilot project simulating an airport border checking point, where the
border checks are performed on passengers entering the Schengen area.
d) Schengen Evaluators
The aim is to ensure the highest standards of objective evaluation missions. The course is a one-week
training programme for nominated experts from MS/SAC focusing on how to objectively carry out
evaluation missions.
e) Train the Trainers

Page 123 of 138

The aim of this is to ensure the qualifications of assigned trainers by introducing a common assessment
and certification system.
f)

False Documents Detection

The basic level course targets competencies for officials not directly involved in border guard tasks, while
the advanced level is designed for first and second line officers. It aims at enhancing knowledge of printing
techniques, common terminology and the examination of questioned documents and their analysis.
g) English communication for Border Guards
This training aims at enhancing language communication capabilities among MS/SAC border guards working
in specific fields for enhanced English proficiency as required for performing daily tasks and also for joint
operations at airports coordinated by Frontex. The target audience are practitioners/language instructors
at airports
h) Risk Assessment - NEW
A new multi annual training project on risk assessment is planned to be introduced in 2015. The aim of
this project is to provide border guards with knowledge and understanding of the risk assessment process
and the skills required to undertake a suitable and sufficient risk assessment. It is envisaged to offer a
number of relevant training opportunities related to different levels of risk assessment. Several training
tools need to be developed, targeting special levels with regard to the approximation, application and
enforcement of risk assessment and analysis. The target group of this training are officers working in
national risk analysis units and all players, expected to apply the Common Integrated Risk Analysis Model
(CIRAM).
i)

Search and Rescue On-Scene Co-ordinator - NEW

For maritime border, surveillance officers who may be designated to perform the duties and
responsibilities of a Search and Rescue On-Scene Co-ordinator (OSC) whilst performing border surveillance
tasks are provided with the competences needed for this.
j)

EUROSUR operators – NEW

This training aims at compiling best practice and exchange of experience of EUROSUR operators.

EBGT Profile Training
This type of training activities focus on specific needs of EBGT pool members for carrying out their duties
effectively according to the profile defined for their deployment. It ensures flexible and updated delivery
according to the situation and envisage direct access to training resources during operation.
These curricula focus on improving capability, capacity and performance for each of the 13 profiles listed
in the EBGT pool. EBGT Profile training and knowledge management is considered as a continuously
ongoing process. Courses include practical and theoretical lessons and last 5 to 8 days. Participants are
evaluated in the end to assess their competences, understanding of practices, and the capability of their
further involvement in Frontex coordinated activities in the respective field, of which:
-

Screening and debriefing expert (intelligence gathering) - All Frontex operations

-

Second-line Airport Officer - Frontex Joint Air operations. This course related to Air border
operations underlines the importance of interacting appropriately and respectfully with
passengers in order to enhance civilian trust and increase operational effectiveness.

-

Border Surveillance Officer - Frontex Joint Sea and Land operations. The central aim of this
training is to provide the learners with the competences needed in order to be able to react
Page 124 of 138

effectively and lawfully in different typical border related scenarios and to tackle organized
crime by adopting own tactical and behavioural standards.
-

Escort Officer - Frontex Joint Return operations. This course focuses on common
qualifications needed to enhance the safety and security of return operations by air.

Activity plan 2015

Educational standards (Common Core Curricula)
SQF for Border Guarding
The focus of the SQF follow up is in 2015 still on the design and delivery of a Multipliers Course in Course
Design in line with the Bologna/Copenhagen principles in the context of the SQF (designed as a Train-theTrainers concept). The workshops will target the trainers and curriculum design experts nominated by
the MS/SAC as part of Frontex support to the SQF integration at national level.
The national integration of the SQF will be monitored by the SQF Expert Board that will meet once a year
to collect/provide feedback, share experience and best practices and request support as necessary. This
component will serve all the other Frontex training programmes and will ensure the alignment with the
SQF of the common training products developed by Frontex and set the basis for further certification
system.
A panel of Bologna/Copenhagen experts will continue to certify the compliance of Frontex training tools
and courses with the European guidelines which will enable Frontex to offer courses and curricula to the
Member States for national implementation that can be accredited at national level, as well as meaningful
training certificates for the graduates of Frontex courses.
a) Basic (EQF/SQF level 4 and 5)
In 2015 the CCC activities will focus on the finalisation of the Interoperability Assessment Programme, the
continuation of the Teachers’ Mobility and the inclusion of more participants and hosts into the Students’
Exchange.
b) Mid-level (EQF/SQF level 6)
To facilitate the national training efforts, Frontex is, based on the common core learning standards for EU
mid-level border guards, in the process of developing a tailored module/course for Mid-Level Officers on
selected learning areas covering European cooperation, Leadership and Management and Fundamental
Rights. This course is the continuation of the well-known Mid-Level Course (MLC) based on the SQF for
Border Guarding and will be in line with the Bologna and Copenhagen process standards. The pilot course
is envisaged to be carried out in 2015.
c) High level (EQF/SQF level 7) - European Joint Master’s in Strategic Border Management
The European Joint Degree Study Programme will be delivered by a Consortium of border guard Academies
and Universities in collaboration with other supporting institutions from the border guard training and
education field. This 1,5 years programme includes 12 weeks in different Universities with the preparation
of a dissertation. It guarantees access to rich on-line resources and a virtual learning environment.
Experienced border guard professionals from all across EU and high profile academics guide the students
throughout this learning adventure close to operational realities. The first iteration of the programme will
be launched in the autumn 2015.

False Documents Detection
Roadshows for first line border guard officers and Consular Staff Training providing basic training on false
documents detection for Embassy and Consular staff of MS/SAC in Partner Countries will be organised
based on risk analysis. In addition it is envisaged that a level II Specialist Course will be developed. This
course will build further on the existing Specialist Course addressing experienced specialist level document
experts having completed the specialist course.
English communication for Border Guards
Roadshows performed at airports in cooperation with Local Border Police Authorities will be organised to
provide for first and second line border guard officers. In 2015 the interactive training material will be
reviewed, further developed, adapted and made available to the Member States through training
multipliers. It will apply tailored, innovative and cost-effective solutions for carrying out training activities
– e.g. distance learning and blended training solution.
Risk Assessment - NEW
A new multi annual training project on risk assessment is planned to be introduced in 2015. The aim of
this project is to provide border guards with knowledge and understanding of the risk assessment process
and the skills required to undertake a suitable and sufficient risk assessment. It is envisaged to offer a
number of relevant training opportunities related to different levels of risk assessment. Several training
tools need to be developed, targeting special levels with regard to the approximation, application and
enforcement of risk assessment and analysis. The target group of this training are officers working in
Page 126 of 138

national risk analysis units and all players, expected to apply the Common Integrated Risk Analysis Model
(CIRAM).
Search and Rescue On-Scene Co-ordinator - NEW
In 2015 the concept will be further developed based on experiences gained in 2014.
EUROSUR operator - NEW
In 2015 the concept will be defined and the project will be launched based on existing national courses.

EBGT Profile Training
EBGT training will be carry out in line with operation plan to ensure that Guest Officers (GO) and Seconded
Guest Officers (SGOs) have the specific knowledge and skills to effectively perform their tasks and duties
while being deployed during Frontex joint operations.
Ad hoc training for certain Partner Countries return officers and escort teams will be provided in
cooperation with Frontex Return Operations Sector in the framework of specific return working
arrangements and based on their training needs to have an adequate number of qualified return officers
available for national and joint return operations by air. In 2015 additional training will be provided based
on MS/SAC training needs and the operational needs of Frontex Return Operations Sector.

Frontex Training Support Networks, New Solutions for Professional Education
and Ad Hoc Training
Cooperation with external stakeholders from MS/SAC and Partner Countries is the key to ensuring adequate
implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004 (“Frontex regulation”) in terms of cooperation
with Member States/SAC and Partner Countries. For all of the activities mentioned below, extension of
the cooperation with other European Agencies, i.e. those in the field of Law Enforcement, is envisaged.
National Training Coordinators (NTC) Network
The network will be consulted to enable Frontex to develop a tailored training offer comprising quality
training products which reflect the national needs on one hand and the European dimension of the border
management on the other hand. The NTC platform will offer the Member States the possibility to decide
on their involvement and contribution to the training projects. Moreover, the National Training
Coordinators contribute to all phases of the training development and implementation and their
involvement is essential for a two-way direct communication with all states in training matters.
Frontex Partnership Academies (PA) Network
The PA network of national border guard academies will continue to support Frontex by hosting Frontex
meetings and training activities. The scope of the Partnership Academy Network may be extended towards
increasing their involvement and input to training projects.
ICT Development
The aim of the ICT development project is to develop and implement a user friendly design for training
applications and to upgrade the platform with applications and services needed for ensuring effective
provisions for training and learning supporting the European Border Guard community. The ICT
development will in 2015 be carried out based on recommendations from a feasibility study made in 2014.
Frontex Virtual Aula is a web-based platform which offers information about training activities carried out
by Frontex. More than 2000 border guards from 37 states are registered in the network. After the migration
Page 127 of 138

of the platform into Frontex’ premises in 2014 the platform will be maintained until the integrated IT
platform for training, knowledge and learning management is developed and implemented in 2015.
Expert Boards
The Expert Boards represent a platform for training development and implementation. These are bodies
composed of national experts in a specific field, who meet regularly in order to discuss the latest
developments in their respective field in the context of training. The Boards will continue to review the
training programmes and propose further steps for training / education in the respective field.
Working Arrangements with Partner Countries
Frontex will make available to Partner Countries access to Frontex Training products. Frontex maintains
limited readiness to carry out training projects in non-member states financed from external sources.
Ad Hoc Training Activities
Based on indications from stakeholders, Frontex aims at creating and maintaining a readiness to provide
training also on ad hoc basis. These activities aim at covering urgent operational needs, strengthen the
flexible reaction capacity and enhance agility in training.

ANNEX 4 – Assessment of Operational Deployment and Plan of
Operational Activities 2015

Annex 4 contains two documents which are provided to the Management Board separately.
The Assessment of Operational Deployment describes the latest trends concerning the irregular
migratory situation (based on information available until mid-August 2014). This to identify the border
sections or border areas of the external borders of the EU which are likely to be affected by irregular
migration flows and cross border crime in the near future.
This Assessment of Operational Deployment forms one of the basis on which the more detail Plan of
Operational Activities 2015 was elaborated.
Due to their sensitive content, the disclosure of which would jeopardise and seriously harm the success of
MS driven and supported operational activities coordinated by Frontex, both documents have been
classified as ‘RESTREINT UE’.
To avoid classification of the whole Programm of Work the decision was made to separate the two
documents from the Programme of Work, provide the public version of the Management Summary of the
‘Assessment of Operational Deployment’ and leave a reference to the ‘Plan of Operations 2015’ as Annex
4 of the Programme of Work 2014.

Introduction
The aim of this document is to describe the latest trends concerning the irregular migratory situation from
January to mid-August 20149 as an update of the Annual Risk Analysis, which was released in March 2014.
The Assessment is part of the Operational Planning Cycle of the Agency, and has been produced in order
to provide the basis for the bilateral talks with Member States to be held in October 2014 and the Plan of
Operations for 2015.
The scope of this document is limited to the identification of border sections or border areas of the
external borders of the EU which are likely to be affected by significant irregular migration flows and
cross-border crime. Furthermore, this document will give a forecast on related modi operandi and
phenomena, which require the coordination of reinforced operational measures at the external borders
of Member States as one of the first steps of operational planning.
This document is largely based on the data exchanged within the Frontex Risk Analysis Network (FRAN)
covering the first half of 2014 and is also complemented with data gathered through the Joint Operation
Reporting Application (JORA) from the areas of ongoing operational activities coordinated by Frontex until
17 August10 and data made available in Eurosur. In addition, this report takes into account the Pulsar data
set for air borders and the main findings of Frontex strategic reports such as European Document Fraud
(EDF), as well as relevant Joint Operation reports and information collected through operational activities,
in particular from debriefing irregular migrants.
A forecast of migration trends provides a glimpse of what may occur in 2015 and is based on the
extrapolation of current trends and patterns that are related to known factors that constitute certainties.

Page 129 of 138

These are, for example, major migration routes, geographical proximity to third countries of transit and
origin of irregular migration. However, such a forecast is also subject to uncertainties that may
significantly affect migration trends and thus the conclusions and operational recommendations should be
looked at carefully while being cognisant of unexpected changes that may have an impact on the overall
situation at the external borders throughout the operational planning cycle.
When it comes to priorities of recommended measures/actions, this assessment takes into consideration
the major risks identified in the Annual Risk Analysis document, which have been reviewed according to
the situation during the first half of 2014 and information collected through ongoing operational activities.
The Risk Analysis Unit at Frontex is constantly monitoring migration trends and should any major changes
occur during the course of the planning and implementation period of operational activities, these changes
would be reported through regular analytical products to Member States (MSs) and to Frontex
management. This allows timely decisions to be made regarding the necessary reallocation of resources
to operational activities corresponding to operational needs.

General Overview of the Situation
Irregular Migration
At EU level, in the first half of 2014, detections of illegal border-crossing at the external blue and green
borders11 of the EU totalled 90 200, a level which shows a 160% increase compared to the first half of
2013 (34 500) despite a 30% decrease in the number of detections at land borders. By the middle of August,
this number had risen to approximately 140 000. This enormous increase is due to the unprecedented scale
of migratory flows at sea across the Central Mediterranean and to a lesser extent the increasing trends in
irregular migrant apprehensions in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Western Mediterranean region. In
addition, during the same period nearly 900 clandestine attempts were detected and more than 10 100
persons were apprehended while using false documents (both on entry and exit) at the EU’s external
border-crossing points representing a slight increase compared to the first half of the previous year
(9 500). Of these, 7 300 were detected at airports, 1 870 at land border-crossing points and 860 at
seaports.

EU during the period 1 Jan - 17 Aug 2014.

In 2014 the Central Mediterranean Sea has become by far the main migratory route to the EU for thousands
of irregular migrants departing from Libya, Egypt and Turkey. Early in 2013, some increase was expected
in the number of migrants departing from Libya and Egypt, due to geo-political tussles in these countries.

In October 2013 Italy commenced the implementation of the Operation Mare Nostrum12, which is aimed
at preventing loss of life at sea. This Operation Mare Nostrum, a search and rescue operation, was
launched in response to the fatal incident, which occurred at the beginning of October 2013, in which
more than 300 migrants drowned after their boat capsized off the Italian island of Lampedusa. The assets
of the Italian Navy operating in Mare Nostrum have the capability of operating permanently at sea, in an
operational area located to the south of the Maltese search and rescue area and in the north of the Libyan
search and rescue area. This operation enables the early detection and rescue of migrant boats in distress
much closer to the Libyan coast than the assets deployed in the framework of the Joint Operation Hermes.
Since November 2013 it has become more and more evident that facilitation networks in Libya have taken
advantage of the areas of patrolling of Mare Nostrum assets, adapting their modus operandi in a way that
has increased the profitability of their illegal business. Facilitators in Libya have been increasingly making
use of boats that are unseaworthy. Moreover, boats are dangerously overcrowded, which increases the
risk of fatalities, and with not enough fuel to even reach the island of Lampedusa, the risks these migrants
take are enormous. Furthermore, the migrants are given no food or water and they are often not provided
with life jackets and if they are, there are very few of them available. In order to maximise capacity
aboard the boats the migrants are segregated and some migrants are confined below deck in what is often
the engine room, this exposes the migrants to fumes during the journey which has led to migrants dying
from asphyxiation aboard overcrowded boats. It is worth noting that children, pregnant women and elderly
people are increasingly present in such overcrowded boats. This modus operandi used by facilitation
networks relies on the intervention of the Italian Navy in the vicinity of the Libyan coast, when migrants
make a distress call for assistance after a few hours of navigation.
The increasing trend in the Central Mediterranean has continued during 2014 with the number of detected
irregular migrants reaching unprecedented levels and even surpassing the totals recorded during previous
years already in April 2014.
Most irregular migrants departing from Libya are motivated by humanitarian factors coming from conflict
areas or being subject to persecution and other reasons sufficient to ground an application for asylum.
For these reasons, many of them, such as Eritreans and Syrians, are not returned to their countries of
origin. This aspect is known by facilitation networks and contributes as a ‘push factor’ on the Central
Mediterranean route. In addition, many of these migrants only lodge their claim for asylum in the intended
countries of final destination, such as Germany and Sweden, and not in Italy.
Despite the huge efforts of the Italian authorities involved in search and rescue operations and saving
many lives at sea, by 17 August the number of fatalities had increased compared to last year and its ratio
is the highest in the region, particularly around the Pelagic Islands.

Figure 2: Number of illegal border-crossings at sea in the Central Mediterranean

Figures made available to Frontex through JORA suggest that at least 126 confirmed fatalities occurred
during the crossing of the Mediterranean Sea during the first seven months of 2014 13. This represents a

Joint Operations (JORA).
Page 131 of 138

sharp increase compared to the same period of 2013 when only 6 confirmed fatalities were reported. The
calculation of this death toll, measured against the overall number of irregular migrants detected shows
that maritime crossings during 2014 have become inherently more dangerous 14. This means that the risk
of loss of life at sea during maritime crossings in the Central Mediterranean has increased despite the
enormous collective efforts by the Italian authorities and the assistance provided by private vessels.
This assumption is echoed by an estimation carried out by the UNHCR as of 26 August 2014 15, according to
which roughly 1 900 persons have died in the Mediterranean Sea since the beginning of 2014 compared to
a total of 600 persons during 2013.

Figure 3: Location of recorded fatalities indicating the number of corpses recovered in the Central Mediterranean
from 1 January to 17 August 2014.

The massive pressure of irregular migration in the Central Mediterranean area has stretched the reception
centre capacities of Italy. In addition, many migrants who claimed asylum, have absconded the reception
and asylum centres and moved on, towards their preferred destination countries, namely Sweden,
Germany, France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.
Migrants from the Horn of Africa and sub-Saharan regions of Africa are often mistreated at different stages
of their journey in Africa. They also face a significant risk of dying during the desert crossing or when
making the sea crossing from North Africa to the EU. Their vulnerability during their migration from Africa
to Europe is therefore considered very high.
There has been a high rate of women and minors from Syria and to a lesser extent, women and minors
from the Horn of Africa targeting the islands of Lampedusa and Sicily.
In addition to the migratory flow from Libya there has been a growing trend of sea crossings directly from
Egypt towards the south eastern Italian coasts of Calabria and Sicily (from around 1 800 in 2013 to 8 500
14

More precisely, during 2014 there was one confirmed death for every 635 people that arrived in Italy and Malta compared
to one confirmed death for every 2 166 person during 2013.

thus far in 2014) mainly involving Syrian and Egyptian nationals. At the same time irregular migration along
the direct route from Turkey to Calabria in Italy and from Greece to Calabria and Apulia in Italy has
continued on a similar level as last year. Irregular migration from Tunisia remains low.
The Eastern Mediterranean has been ranked as the second main entry point to the EU thus far in 2014 in
terms of the volume of irregular migrants, even though figures are on a different scale than in the Central
Mediterranean. From the beginning of January until the middle of August, more than 20 600 irregular
migrants were apprehended along this route (compared to 10 000 for the same period of 2013), including
detections at the land and sea borders of the EU with Turkey. The number of apprehended irregular
migrants in 2014 has doubled compared to the same period of 2013, mainly due to increased irregular
migratory flows across the Greek sea (from 6 700 to 17 400) and land borders (from 550 to 1 000) with
Turkey. At the same time, apprehensions at the Bulgarian–Turkish green border decreased by 30% (from
2 500 to 1 800). Operational measures adopted by the Greek and Bulgarian authorities at their land borders
with Turkey have resulted in a significant shift in irregular migratory flows towards the Greek Aegean
Islands and to a certain extent towards the major Border-Crossing Points in Bulgaria.
In addition to the reinforcement of surveillance at the land borders 16, the operational measures in Greece
and Bulgaria include the increased capacity of detention facilities and permit longer detention periods for
irregular migrants apprehended at the land borders. These measures have led migrants to try to avoid
detection and also to seek alternative routes from Turkey, mainly across the Aegean Sea to the nearest
Greek Islands such as Samos and Lesvos, where the detention capacity is rather limited and where migrants
expect the period of detention to be short, practically, between one and three days. At the same time
the number of migrants travelling from Turkish airports with forged travel documents has been increasing.
The main nationalities using the Eastern Mediterranean route are the same as last year: Syrian nationals
represent the main apprehended nationality (9 700), their number in the framework of the JO Poseidon
Sea more than tripled in 2014 and the trend is still increasing. They are followed by Afghans (4 200) and
to a much lower extent by Somalis (870) and Eritreans (380).
Since Syrians often migrate together with their families the proportion of women and minors has been
high.
With regard to fatalities, thus far in 2014, 7 incidents involving 53 deaths have been reported in the
operational area of the JO Poseidon Sea. Fatal incidents were mainly caused by unseaworthy and
overcrowded boats which were used by the facilitation networks for sea crossings and by the lack of the
most elementary navigational skills of the skippers.
For would-be migrants stranded in Turkey another alternative route to enter the EU is across the Black
Sea. Since the beginning of the year, 5 incidents related to illegal migration have been reported in the
Black Sea (2 incidents in Bulgaria and 3 incidents in Romania), involving the apprehension of 194 irregular
migrants mainly from Syria and Afghanistan. The low number of apprehended migrants indicates that
this route is still not preferred by facilitation networks operating in Turkey, compared to the shorter and
safer routes towards the Greek Eastern Aegean Islands.
Most of the irregular migrants entering Greece and Bulgaria illegally are travelling further either across
the Western Balkans or on intra-EU flights using false documents.
Along the EU’s external borders with the Western Balkans the number of detected illegal bordercrossings17 reported during the first two quarters of 2014 (6 000) decreased to one half (-53%), compared
with the same period of 2013 (12 500). The Western Balkan route has remained intensively used by
migrants involved in secondary movements; about 77% of the irregular migrants apprehended at the EU’s
external land borders with the Western Balkans had previously entered Greece or Bulgaria and only 23%
of them originated from one of the Western Balkan countries. One of the reasons acting as a ‘pull factor’
along this route is the lack of mitigation measures available to law enforcement authorities detecting
migrants that are staying illegally. Often, migrants are released soon after apprehension with an

16 In

August 2014, 515 additional officers have been deployed at the Greek and 1 270 at the Bulgarian land borders to
strengthen border control activities. These operations have been extended until 30 September in Greece and until 31
December in Bulgaria.

administrative order to leave the country within a short period of time. This is well-known by migrants
and facilitation networks.
On account of secondary movements, the migratory flow across the Western Balkans, roughly mirrored
the migratory trends observed on the Eastern Mediterranean route. The number of Afghan and Syrian
migrants reported for illegal border-crossing during the period of analysis, increased sharply compared
with the corresponding period of 2013 and ranked respectively as the first (Afghans – 1 800), and the
second (Syrian – 1 200) nationalities reported at the EU’s land borders with the Western Balkans. At the
same time in 2014, the number of Kosovars dropped to less than 1 000 from over 5 000 and became the
third nationality group after Afghans and Syrians, meanwhile the number of Algerian (from 880 to below
30) and Pakistani nationals (from 1 900, to 120) also decreased significantly. The vast majority of irregular
migrants, more than 7 000, were apprehended at the Hungarian land border with Serbia.
In the Western Mediterranean and Atlantic region, the situation remains relatively stable but with
increasing trends both at the land (Ceuta and Melilla) and also at the sea borders of Spain.
From 1 January to 30 June 2014, around 2 800 irregular migrants were apprehended by the Spanish
authorities at sea and an additional 2 200 at the land borders of Ceuta and Melilla on the African continent.
Both figures show a significant increase of 86% and 40% respectively. Thus far in 2014, the main
nationalities of irregular migrants attempting to enter Spain have been similar to those in 2013: mainly
migrants from Algeria, Morocco and countries of the Western-Saharan region.
The trends and figures along this route have to be carefully assessed taking into consideration the high
number of interventions reported by the Moroccan authorities with regard to the number of migrants
prevented from crossing the Spanish borders. The number of preventions particularly in the area of the
Gibraltar Strait, due to Moroccan cooperation, confirms the constant irregular migratory pressure in the
region mainly from Morocco, despite the fact that the overall number of apprehended migrants reported
by Spain cannot be considered high, compared with the numbers reported on other routes in the Central
and Eastern Mediterranean Sea.
In Melilla, similar to last year, during the months of June and July migrants from sub-Saharan countries
increasingly attempted to scale the border fence which separates the Spanish territory from Morocco.
Irregular migration from Morocco and the Western Sahara to the Canary Islands has remained low due to
the continued joint patrols operated by Spain with Morocco and Senegal. In 2014 less than 150 irregular
migrants were apprehended who attempted to reach the Spanish Islands.
At the EU’s Eastern Land Borders, similar to previous years, detections of illegal border-crossings
remained at a lower level than on other routes. Compared with the corresponding period last year,
between 1 January and 17 August 2014, the number of apprehended irregular migrants decreased along
the green border by more than half (53% from 926 to 432).
In addition, the border sections along the EU’s Eastern land borders are characterised by two common
phenomena: incidents related to the smuggling of goods, particularly tobacco, and a large number of
refusals of entry. Each day a large number of travellers cross the major border-crossing points especially
at the border of Poland with Belarus, and the Polish, Hungarian and Romanian borders with Ukraine.
Refusals of entry sometimes involve document fraud or clandestine entry. This year, between 1 January
and 17 August 616 persons were reported at BCPs using false documents while only 8 migrants were
detected attempting to enter hiding in vehicles.
In 2014 the pressure has been high at the Air Borders especially in regard to Syrian and Eritrean nationals
claiming asylum. According to Pulsar data18, the number of asylum claims from 1 January until 17 August
2014 at the EU’s air borders was 10 412; the top 5 nationalities were from Syria (4 757), Eritrea (1 410),
Sri Lanka (404), Iran (396) and Afghanistan (363). The main affected airports were, in descending order:
Stockholm (ARN), London (LHR), Frankfurt (FRA), Amsterdam (AMS) and Vienna (VIE). The weekly average
number of asylum claims to 17 August 2014 was 315 persons. The trend has slightly increased compared
to the same period in 2013, when the average was about 295 persons per week.

18

Please note, Pulsar Data provide the timeliest statistical data of activity at the Schengen and non-Schengen EU air borders.
However, unlike FRAN data they do not cover all airports in the EU and SAC. Furthermore, certain gaps exist in the Pulsar
data sets.
Page 134 of 138

For refusal of entry the total number was 24 695; the numbers are similar to the same period in 2013 and
the patterns almost overlap. The top refused nationalities came from Albania (1 892), the United States
(1 447), Brazil (1 391), Algeria (946) and Nigeria (900). The main airports reporting the top refused
nationalities were Paris (CDG), London (LHR), Madrid (MAD), Rome (FCO) and Frankfurt (FRA). The top
nationalities refused entry in the EU are almost all refused because of a lack of sufficient means or have
no appropriate documentation justifying the purpose and conditions of stay. The number of Brazilian
nationals decreased, whereas Albanian nationals increased and were mainly refused whilst in transit at
Milan (MXP) and Rome (FCO).

Cross-Border Crime
The smuggling of cigarettes remained the main cross-border crime reported at the eastern borders in
2014, based on incidents recorded by Member States. Smuggled cigarettes usually had excise stamps from
Ukraine, Belarus and the Russian Federation. Modi operandi remained also unchanged with smuggled goods
hidden in personal belongings or in different means of transportation in specially constructed
compartments or in the cargo. In addition, goods were smuggled outside of BCPs along the green land
borders or across rivers. The use of various flying machines, such as motor hang-gliders or unmanned rafts
for the transportation of illicit goods across the border, has been reported more and more often by border
authorities. However, one of the largest hauls of cigarettes was detected in Greece in the Ionian Sea. The
Greek seizure amounted to 10.9 million cigarettes transported aboard a cargo ship.
Because of the operational remit of Frontex, the smuggling of drugs has not been a top priority. While
seizures of all drug types were made, in most cases there were too few seizures to either support or
contradict most of the trafficking trends put forward by Europol’s SOCTA report or the EMCDDA’s European
Drug Report. However, a few trends were supported by data collected through Frontex reporting. The
Moroccan-Spanish Hashish (Cannabis Resin) route mentioned in the SOCTA 2013 report was supported by
a number of large (>400kg) seizures along the sea border by Frontex Joint Operation assets. Similarly, all
of the major cocaine seizures made by Joint Operation assets were along the SOCTA defined South
America-Western Europe route, with the majority of shipments destined for Spain or Portugal. Moreover,
the reports on anti-drug operations this year in Albania and the seizures of large amounts of marijuana
plants and five drug labs19 confirms that cannabis resin is being trafficked from Albania to the EU across
the Adriatic or via the Western Balkans. Whilst a few major seizures were made, not enough data was
collected to analyse the overall routes and trends of Heroin and New Psychoactive Substances (NPS), or
the ancillary routes of Cocaine and Cannabis.
The Black Sea and its connection to the Danube might be a potential route for smugglers of drugs, persons
and commodities; however, so far the detections do not confirm this assumption. Under the framework of
the Danube River Forum, two joint operations were organised by Hungary with the involvement of all the
riparian states, but without significant detections reported.
This year MS authorities detected more than 120 stolen vehicles including parts and pieces at the Focal
Points until the middle of August 2014. The highest figures were reported from the Polish and Hungarian
borders with the Ukraine (46 and 42 respectively), followed by the Polish border with Belarus (13) and the
Croatian border with Serbia (12). Although detection figures at the borders decreased by more than 40%
compared to the same period of 2013, it is assumed that the actual trend of vehicle smuggling across the
borders is much higher than what statistics on detections indicate.
