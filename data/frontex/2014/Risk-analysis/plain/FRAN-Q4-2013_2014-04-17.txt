Frontex official publications fall into four main categories: risk analysis, training, operations
and research, each marked with a distinct graphic identifier. Risk analysis publications
bear a triangular symbol formed by an arrow drawing a triangle, with a dot at the centre.
Metaphorically, the arrow represents the cyclical nature of risk analysis processes and its
orientation towards an appropriate operational response. The triangle is a symbol of ideal
proportions and knowledge, reflecting the pursuit of factual exactness, truth and exhaustive
analysis. The dot at the centre represents the intelligence factor and the focal point where
information from diverse sources converges to be processed, systematised and shared as
analytical products. Thus, Frontex risk analysis is meant to be at the centre and to form
a reliable basis for its operational activities.

Executive summary
The fourth quarter of 2013 was characterised
by the highest number of detections of illegal
border-crossing of all fourth quarters since
2009. Specifically, the number of detections
in the Central Mediterranean was more than
four times higher than in Q4 2012. However,
as in most previous years, detections on this
route decreased between Q3 and Q4 due to
the onset of the winter season rendering sea
crossing more difficult.
In a tragic accident on 3 October 2013, more
than 360 migrants died when a wooden boat
capsized near Lampedusa. The tragedy took
place when migrants lit a fire to draw the attention of nearby vessels after the satellite telephone provided by the facilitation network
had failed to work. The fire got out of control
and panic erupted onboard. A search-and-rescue operation initiated by an emergency call
of a nearby fishing boat mobilised all maritime on-duty assets in the region. Emergency
services managed to rescue 158 migrants, but
the remaining passengers, mostly Somalis and
Eritreans, died during the accident. According to the investigations, the country of embarkation of the migrant boat was Libya. A
Tunisian national, the alleged captain of the
boat, was later arrested by the Italian police.
The accident did not deter other migrants
staying in Northern Africa to set sail to the
EU, as in October, the number of migrants
from sub-Saharan Africa detected in the Central Mediterranean remained comparable to
the level in September. After a temporary decrease in November 2013, figures in December
were again substantially higher than usually
during the winter season, although weather
and sea conditions in the Central Mediterranean were not encouraging to cross on that
route. According to reports, deteriorating living conditions particularly in Libya acted as
a pull factor for migration to Italy. The majority of African irregular migrants detected
along the Central Mediterranean route were
Eritreans.

A relatively new phenomenon is the growing presence of Gambian irregular migrants,
detections of whom increased for the sixth
consecutive quarter and exceeded 1 300 in
Q4 2013, while back in Q4 2011 there had
been no Gambians detected in the Central
Mediterranean.
Many of the nationalities detected in the
Central Mediterranean in Q4 2014 were subsequently also detected on intra-Schengen
flights leaving Italy towards northern Europe,
most commonly on the route from Malpensa
to Copenhagen. The most commonly detected nationalities included migrants from
Eritrea, Somalia and Syria, many of whom
then submitted asylum claims in Sweden.
In comparison to last winter, Syrians had
also significant impact on the situation on
the Central Mediterranean route. The number of Syrians escaping the armed conflict
in their country and detected on this route
grew from just 96 in the last quarter of 2012
to a massive 3 432 a year later, thus closely
following Eritreans as the most detected nationality in the Central Mediterranean. Migrant interviews conducted during the JO
Hermes suggest that the increasing pressure on Syrian refugees in Egypt may prompt
them to consider departure from the country via Libya to Europe.
Overall, Syrians were the most commonly
detected nationality, both at the sea and
land border of the EU. With over 3 000 detections, the largest share of Syrians illegally
crossing the EU external border was reported
between Turkey and Bulgaria. This section of
the green border has not only seen four consecutive increases since Q4 2012, but also the
largest rise in absolute numbers.
Simultaneously, Syrian migrants represented
the highest share of persons detected for
illegal stay and clandestine entry. Moreover, Syrians showed to be the largest group

5 of 26

Frontex · FRAN Quarterly · q4 2013

among migrants submitting asylum applications in the EU. The armed conflict in Syria
has for example resulted in Bulgaria increasingly becoming a destination country. Since
Q4 2012 overall applications in Bulgaria have
increased fivefold, and over three-quarters of
all applications made there in Q4 2013 were
submitted by Syrians. Hence, except for a
few seasonal short-term variations, all indicators have been showing a clear upward
trend since 2011 and made Syrians the most
commonly reported nationality regarding irregular migration to the EU.
Overall number of asylum applications was
steadily increasing throughout 2013, reaching almost 100 000 in the final quarter of the
year, which was the highest number since
the FRAN data collection began. Remarkable
in this regard is a growing concentration of
applications submitted by some of the most
represented nationalities: if the asylum seekers from Syria and the Horn of Africa were
excluded, the numbers in Q4 2013 would be
lower both in comparison to the previous
year and to the previous quarter.
Of all nationalities in the Horn of Africa, Eritreans had the largest effect on the total
number and the percentage increase of asylum applications. In the fourth quarter of 2013,
the number of Eritreans applying for asylum reached a record number of more than
7 000 applicants. Moreover, Member States
reported a 14% increase in Somali asylum applicants in comparison to Q4 2012.

Western Balkan nationals seeking international protection in the EU showed a diverse
picture in Q4 2013: with 12 446 applicants,
the total number of asylum seekers from
the Western Balkans (excluding Kosovo*) has
been the highest since the introduction of
visa-free travel in December 2009 and 2010.
In some countries, however, the measures introduced to discourage people from abusing
the receiving countries’ asylum systems appear to have been effective. Compared to Q4

2012, numbers of asylum seekers from Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Montenegro decreased by almost 10%, with Serbian
nationals alone submitting over 500 fewer
applications. On the other hand, asylum applications submitted by nationals of Albania
and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia grew by 76% and 20%, respectively.
Since 2009, a rising share of asylum seekers
from the Western Balkans has been choosing Germany as a host country. While in 2010
a third of the visa-free nationals targeted
Germany, during the reference period more
than three-quarters submitted their asylum application in that country. This is particularly true for asylum seekers from Serbia
and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, of whom 86% and 91%, respectively,
sought international protection in Germany
in Q4 2013. There was a general increase in
the share of applications received by the current top asylum destinations. The proportion
of EU overall asylum applications registered
by Germany, Sweden and the UK grew from
35% in Q4 2009 to 60% in Q4 2013.
In addition, while most Albanian asylum seekers choose Germany as a destination country, Greece was the country reporting the
largest number of Albanians staying illegally.
Also detections of illegal border-crossing at
the Greek land border with Albania increased
by a third compared to the previous quarter,
although the situation improved in December 2013. Since they were granted visa-free
access to the Schengen area, Albanians have
also been increasingly detected using fraudulent documents (counterfeit border-crossing
stamps) in two distinct contexts: to fabricate
travel histories for multiple and extended
stays in Greece, and to enter the UK from
the Schengen area. In both cases their detections steadily decreased in 2013, including
the final quarter of the year, although Albanians are still among the most commonly detected nationalities using document fraud to
travel to and within the EU.

1. Introduction
FRAN Quarterly reports are prepared by the
Frontex Risk Analysis Unit and provide a regular overview of irregular migration at the
EU external borders, based on the irregularmigration data exchanged among Member
State border-control authorities within the
cooperative framework of the Frontex Risk
Analysis Network (FRAN) and its subsidiary,
the European Union Document-Fraud Risk
Analysis Network (EDF-RAN).
The main purpose of the FRAN Quarterlies
is to provide:
1. feedback to the FRAN community in the
context of information exchange;
2. a periodic update to the situational picture
of irregular migration at the EU level; and
3. material for constructive discussion on
reporting protocols and related trends
and patterns.
This report is intended to simultaneously
serve two objectives: first, to provide a clear
summary of the situation at the external border of the EU, and second, to serve as an archive for future reference and comparative
analyses. Consistent with standard archival
techniques, some information is repeated
among sections to serve as context.
Harmonising complex, multi-source migration data among Frontex and Member States
is an ongoing process. Therefore, some of
the more detailed data and trends in this
report should be interpreted with caution

and, where possible, cross-referenced with
information from other sources. The statistics should be understood in the context of
the different levels of passenger flows passing through different border sections, the
activities undertaken by Member State border-control authorities to secure different
border sections, and widespread variation
in reporting and data-collection practices.
FRAN members, Member State risk analysis
experts and border-control authorities are
considered the primary customers of these
reports. In addition to the discussions taking place during FRAN meetings, Member
State experts are invited and actively encouraged to examine and comment upon
the data and analyses presented here. Despite all efforts of the Frontex Risk Analysis
Unit and Member State experts involved in
data exchange and analyses, it is conceivable that minor errors will occur in these reports due to very challenging timelines, and
the growing volume and complexity of data
and other information exchanged within the
FRAN community.
Due to the simultaneous release of the
Annual Risk Analysis 2014 presenting a
comprehensive analysis of the situation in
the whole of 2013, the current FRAN Quarterly (Q4 2013) is a short issue containing
the statistics and only a general overview
of the developments in the reviewed period (see Executive summary).

2. Methodology
This, the 22nd issue of the FRAN Quarterly, is a
comparative analysis of FRAN data collected
between October and December 2013, and
exchanged between 30 Member State border-control authorities within the framework
of the FRAN. The report presents the results
of statistical analysis of quarterly variations in
eight irregular-migration indicators and one
asylum indicator, aggregated at the level of
the event. Bi-monthly analytical reports exchanged by Member States were also used
for interpretative purposes and to provide
qualitative information, as were other available sources of information, such as Frontex
Joint Operations.
Precise definitions of Indicators 1 to 6, aimed
at harmonising the data exchanged at EU
level, were presented in the annexes of the
Q1 and Q2 reports in 2009 and so are not
repeated here.
During the June 2010 FRAN Meeting, a proposal for a harmonised definition of the return
indicator was outlined and several questions
were presented in order to motivate discus-

Monthly data on the following indicators were exchanged
among the FRAN community:
1A detections of illegal border-crossing between BCPs
1B detections of illegal border-crossing at BCPs
2 detections of suspected facilitators
3 detections of illegal stay
4 refusals of entry
5 asylum applications
6 document fraud (EDF-RAN)
7A return decisions for illegally staying third-country nationals

sion among FRAN members in view of establishing the regular collection of monthly
return data by Frontex. Subsequently, an online survey of FRAN members was conducted
to gather information and further motivate
discussion to fine-tune the proposal for the
indicator. The 11th FRAN report (Q1 2011) was
the first to include analysis of Indicators 7A
and 7B, and the definitions of these indicators are included in an annex to that report.
Data collection commenced in January 2011.
The FRAN data-exchange has been in place
since September 2007. Data are exchanged
through the ICONet Internet platform, an interest group of the European Commission’s
CIRCA server. Member State monthly data
are based on a country template prepared by
the Frontex Risk Analysis Unit. The deadline
for submitting data for each month is the
25th day of the subsequent month, with the
exception of the end of year data, which are
requested by 15 January each year. For this
22nd issue of the FRAN Quarterly, the target
for Member States to upload the monthly
data was thus 15 January 2014. In principle, data submitted subsequent to this date
will be reflected in the next FRAN Quarterly, except in cases where clarification is
needed in order to proceed with comprehensive analysis.
Following the closure of the CIREFI working
group in April 2010, most of its mandates and,
of particular relevance, the exchange of data
were transferred to the FRAN. Fortunately,
most CIREFI indicators already overlapped
with the monthly data exchange of FRAN
members. The exception was the indicator
on returns, which was added as part of the
regular data exchange within the FRAN at
the beginning of 2011.

In January 2012, the European Union Document-Fraud Risk Analysis Network (EDFRAN) was formed as a specialist forum to
oversee the exchange and analyses of detections of document fraud to illegally cross
the external borders, and on all international
flights. Data were backdated and joined with
those exchanged under a pilot Tailored Risk
Analysis released in 2011.
The EDF-RAN data are checked for inconsistencies, and corrections are made to reported
totals to bring them in line with reported
breakdowns. Corrections are also made to
any three-letter nationality codes not present in the reference ISO list of nationality codes.*
External borders refer to the borders between Member States and third countries.
The borders between the Schengen Associated Countries (Norway, Iceland and Switzerland) and third countries are also considered
as external borders. The borders between the
Schengen Associated Countries and Schengen Member States are considered as internal borders. For the indicators on detections
of facilitators, illegal stay and asylum, statistics are also reported for detections at the
land borders between the Schengen Member
States and Schengen candidates (Bulgaria,
Cyprus, Croatia and Romania) or non-Schengen Member States (the UK, Ireland), so that
a total for EU Member States and Schengen Associated Countries as a whole can
be presented. It was not possible to make
this distinction for air and sea borders because Member States do not habitually differentiate between extra-EU and intra-EU
air and sea connections but tend to aggregate data for all arrivals.

When data are examined at the level of thirdcountry nationalities, a large percentage
usually falls under the category ‘Other (not
specified)’ or ‘Unknown’. It is expected that
the percentage reported under these categories will decrease with time as Member
States improve the quality and speed of their
identification, data collection and reporting
practices; nationalities are often reported as
‘Unknown’ if an individual’s nationality cannot
be established before reports are submitted.
This issue of the FRAN Quarterly also includes
main findings of Frontex-coordinated Joint
Operations active for at least a proportion of
Q4 2013. Namely, for sea borders they were
JO Poseidon Sea 2013, Focal Points Sea 2013,
JO EPN Hermes 2013, JO EPN Indalo 2013, JO
EPN Aeneas 2013 and JO EPN Hera 2013; for
land borders – JO Poseidon Land 2013, JO
Focal Points Land 2013, Project Coordination Points 2013 and JO Jupiter 2013; for the
air border – JO Focal Points Air 2013; and the
return-related Project Attica 2013.

Sources and Methods
For the data concerning detections at the external borders, some of the border types are
not applicable to all FRAN Member States.
This pertains to data on all FRAN indicators
since the data are provided disaggregated
by border type. The definitions of detections
at land borders are therefore not applicable (excluding borders with non-Schengen
principalities) for Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Iceland,
Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland and
the UK. For Cyprus, the land border refers to
the Green Line demarcation with the area
not under the effective control of the government of the Republic of Cyprus. For sea
borders, the definitions are not applicable for
land-locked Member States including Austria,
the Czech Republic, Hungary, Luxembourg,
Slovakia and Switzerland.
In addition, data on detections of illegal border-crossing at land, air and sea BCPs (1B) are
not available for Iceland, Ireland and Spain
and in Greece (these detections are included
in the data for Indicator 1A). Data for Norway only includes detections of illegal border-crossing at land and sea BCPs (1B), not
between BCPs (1A).
In Italy, detections of illegal border-crossing
at sea BCPs are only reported for intra-EU
border-crossing from Greece. Data on detections of illegal border-crossing between
sea BCPs (1A) are not available for Ireland.
Data on apprehension (FRAN Indicator 2) of
facilitators is not available for Ireland. For Italy, the data are not disaggregated by border
type, but are reported as total apprehensions (not specified). Data for Italy and Norway also include the facilitation of illegal stay
and work. For Romania, the data include
land intra-EU detections on exit at the border with Hungary.

For the data concerning detections of illegal
stay (FRAN Indicator 3), data on detections
at exit are not available for Denmark, Ireland,
Italy, Spain and the UK.
Data on refusals of entry (FRAN Indicator 4)
at the external EU borders are not disaggregated by reason of refusal for Ireland and
the UK. Refusals of entry at the Spanish land
borders at Ceuta and Melilla (without the issuance of a refusal form) are reported separately and are not included in the presented
FRAN data.
The data on applications for international
protection (FRAN Indicator 5) are not disaggregated by place of application (type of
border on entry or inland applications) for
Austria, the Czech Republic and Slovenia.
For these countries, only the total number
of applications is reported. For France, only
asylum applications at the external borders
are reported, not inland applications. For the
UK, data reported for applications at air BCPs
also include applications at sea BCPs.
The data on return decisions issued (FRAN
Indicator 7A) are not available for Ireland,
France, The Netherlands and Sweden. The
data on effective returns (FRAN Indicator
7B) are not available for Ireland. In addition,
the data of effective returns are not disaggregated by return operation (voluntary and
forced) for Spain. The data on voluntary effective returns (FRAN Indicator 7A) are not
disaggregated by type of return operation
(IOM-assisted and others) for Belgium, Czech
Republic, Finland and the Netherlands. The
data on forced effective returns (FRAN Indicator 7A) are not disaggregated by type of return operation (enforced by Member Stated
and by Joint Operations) for Belgium, Finland,
Iceland and the Netherlands.
