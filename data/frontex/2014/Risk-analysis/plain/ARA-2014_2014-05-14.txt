Frontex official publications fall into four main categories: risk analysis, training, operations
and research, each marked with a distinct graphic identifier. Risk analysis publications bear
a triangular symbol formed by an arrow drawing a triangle, with a dot at the centre. Metaphorically, the arrow represents the cyclical nature of risk analysis processes and its orientation towards an appropriate operational response. The triangle is a symbol of ideal proportions
and knowledge, reflecting the pursuit of factual exactness, truth and exhaustive analysis.
The dot at the centre represents the intelligence factor and the focal point where information from diverse sources converges to be processed, systematised and shared as analytical
products. Thus, Frontex risk analysis is meant to be at the centre and to form a reliable basis for its operational activities.

Executive summary
Frontex Annual Risk Analysis 2014 presents
a European summary of trends and developments along the external borders of the
Member States of the EU. It focuses on describing current challenges that are likely to
impact on operations coordinated along the
external borders. It presents the latest update
regarding the situation before the border, at
the border and after the border.
Before the border
Data on visa issuance are not yet available
for 2013, but the European Commission has
released the data for 2012. In 2012, a total of
14 250 595 short-term uniform visas were issued, representing an increase of 13% compared to 2011, and a 51% increase compared
to 2009, when 9 420 896 short-term uniform visas were issued. Most of the visas
(59%) were issued in just three countries: the
Russian Federation, which alone accounted
for 42% of all visas issued in 2012, with nearly
6 million visas, as well as Ukraine (1.3 million,
9%) and China (1.25 million, 8%).
At the border
Passengers
Passenger flow is an indicator of the volume
of checks that border guards have to perform.
However, at European level, there is no systematic reporting on passenger flows by BCP,
border section or as a total for the EU external
borders. At the air border, data from Eurostat
on extra-EU arrivals are the best approximation of the flow of passengers. At the air
border, Eurostat data showed that intra-EU
arrivals (460 million) were approximately four
times larger than extra-EU arrivals (125 million) at main EU airports in 2012. Extra-EU

6 of 80

­ rrivals in 2012 showed a steady trend of +2%
a
compared to 2011. The UK and Germany are
the two Member States reporting the largest number of extra-EU arrivals, each reporting more than 20 million. The main two
airports with the largest number of departures to the EU in 2012 were the Turkish airports of Istanbul Atatürk (IST) and Antalya
Airport (AYT), which reached around 6 million passengers during the year.
At the land border, although data are limited,
it can be assessed that between 2009 and
2013, passenger flows increased more rapidly
at the land border than at the air border in
the wake of visa liberalisation for the Western Balkan countries and the implementation of local border traffic agreements. It is
now assumed that there are more passengers crossing at the land border than at the
air border.
Refusals of entry and document fraud
According to the Schengen Borders Code,
third countries nationals arriving at the external borders may be refused entry into the
EU if not fulfilling all the entry conditions. Refusals of entry rose by 11% between 2012 and
2013, to 128 902. While most refusals of entry are reported from the land and air borders, in line with the distribution of passenger
flows, the long-term trend is an increase at
the land border due to increasing passenger
flow. At the EU level, Russians ranked first
for refusals of entry, followed by Ukrainians
and Albanians.
The Eastern land border saw a large increase in refusals of entry issued to Russians
of Chechen origin at the Polish-Belarusian
land border between March and August 2013.

The migrants showed up without visas and
then applied for asylum. Later on, they also
applied for asylum in Germany.
In the Western Balkans, visa liberalisation
granted to citizens of Serbia, Montenegro,
Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Albania increased both the passenger flow and the
number of refusals of entry. Refusals of entry issued to nationals of the Western Balkan
countries accounted for 18% of all refusals in
the EU in 2013, while this share was only 9%
back in 2010, i.e. before visa liberalisation.
Thus, visa liberalisation resulted in more passengers checked at the borders. At the same
time, passengers no longer requesting a visa
were no longer screened by consulate authorities, thus increasing the responsibilities
of the border-control authorities, which are
now the only authorities to identify travellers who do not meet the criteria for travelling in the EU for a period of three months
within a six-month period, as laid down in
the legislation.
In 2013, there were around 9 800 detections of migrants using document fraud to
illegally enter the EU or Schengen area. The
use of fraudulently obtained (rather than
forged) documents is becoming an increasingly common modus operandi at the border.
This is because modern documents are getting more and more difficult to forge or reproduce. Indeed, detections of fraudulently
obtained passports doubled in 2013 in comparison to 2012.

Illegal border-crossing
Detections of illegal border-crossing along
the EU’s external borders sharply increased
between 2012 and 2013, from approximately
72 500 to 107 000, which represents an
annual increase of 48%. While the annual
increase is significant, the 2013 level is comparable to the totals reported by Member States in 2009 and 2010 (104 600 and
104 000, respectively), and is still lower than
the total reported during the Arab Spring in
2011 (141 000). Apart from this rising trend,
2013 was characterised by three phenomena: a large increase in illegal border-crossings by Syrians, subsequently applying for
asylum, on the Eastern Mediterranean route
and in the Central Mediterranean; a steady
flow of migrants departing from North Africa (Libya and Egypt) putting their life at risk
to cross the Mediterranean Sea; and a sharp
increase, mostly in January-June, in detections reported by Hungary at its land border with Serbia.
Most detections of illegal border-crossing
were of Syrians, Eritreans, Afghans and Albanians, who together accounted for 52% of
total detections (or 55 400). Syrians alone
(25 500) represented almost a quarter of the
total. Their detections at the EU border tripled between 2012 and 2013, reflecting the
dire situation in Syria and the desperate plight
of Syrian refugees. Syrians were by far the
most common nationality to request international protection with 50 096 applications
reported to the Frontex by Member States.
This is nearly twice as much as the already
very high number of applications submitted

7 of 80

Frontex · annual risk analysis 2014

by Syrians in 2012 and represented a significant increase in numbers for the EU.
In the Central Mediterranean area detections were low in the first quarter of 2013,
but gradually increased starting from the
second quarter to reach a peak in the third.
By the end of the year, the annual total was
40 304 detections of illegal border-crossings.
Most boats departed from Libya, where facilitators take advantage of weak government controls. Many migrants also departed
from Egypt.
On the Eastern Mediterranean route, detections (24 800 in 2013) were at the lowest level reported since 2009, but this route
still ranked second and accounted for nearly
a quarter of all detections of illegal bordercrossing to the EU. Compared to 2011 and
2012, the areas of detections also considerably changed and detections in the Eastern
Aegean Sea were the largest, followed by detections along the land border between Bulgaria and Turkey.
Detections of illegal border-crossing strongly
increased on the Western Balkan route, from
about 6 400 in 2012 to 19 500 in 2013. Most
of the detections were reported in February-July 2013 at the Hungarian-Serbian land
border. Migrants detected in that period for
illegal-border crossing immediately applied
for asylum and subsequently absconded
to continue their journey to other Member States.
In the Western Mediterranean area and on
the Western African route, detections of illegal border-crossing remained fairly stable in
2013, with 6 800 and nearly 300 detections
respectively. In the Western Mediterranean,
nearly two-thirds of the detections were reported at the land border in Ceuta and Melilla. This is associated with more effective
prevention of departures at sea by the Moroccan authorities and enhanced prevention

8 of 80

measures in the Mediterranean Sea, including the EPN JO Indalo. Several times in 2013,
the Spanish authorities warned of the permanent threat of migration to Melilla.
At the eastern land border, detections of illegal border-crossing remained at a low level,
at 1 300, or 1.2% of the EU total.
After the border
In 2013, there were about 345 000 detections
of illegal stay in the EU, which represented a
generally stable trend compared to the previous year. This is consistent with a stable, if
slightly declining long-term trend over the
past five years.
Based on the Frontex Risk Analysis Network
(FRAN) data for 2013, the number of asylum
applications submitted in the EU continued to
increase. Preliminary data indicate an overall increase of about 28%, totalling 353 991
applications in 2013. Syrians were by far the
most common nationality to request international protection, nearly double the already
very high number of applications submitted in
2012. More than two-thirds of all Syrian applications were submitted in Sweden, Germany and Bulgaria.
Between 2012 and 2013, detections of facilitators decreased by 11%, totalling about 6 900
in 2013. This decrease may be in part due to
a widespread shift towards the abuse of legal
channels and using document fraud to enter
the EU, which allows facilitators to operate
remotely and inconspicuously rather than accompany migrants.
In 2013, there was a steady trend of about
159 000 third-country nationals effectively
returned to third countries. This total does
not include readmissions between Member
States. As in 2012, the UK and Greece were
the Member States conducting the largest
number of returns.

Conclusions – Outlook
The best forecasts – those likely to materialise and have a direct bearing on the situation
at the external border – spell an increased
workload for border-control authorities as
of October 2014, when all Schengen Member States will be required to be able to carry
out VIS fingerprint verifications at all border-crossing points (BCPs) and also to issue VIS visas with biometrics at the border
when necessary. This additional mandatory
task will come in addition to increased passengers flows, in particular at the land border, due to visa liberalisation and a general
increase in people’s mobility worldwide. Increased workload and responsibilities for
border-control authorities come at a time
of budget constraints.
Looking ahead, everything points to a heightened likelihood of large numbers of illegal border-crossings into the EU and an increased
number of migrants in need of assistance
from search and rescue operations but also
in terms of provision of international protection, in particular in the southern section of

the external border, on the Eastern Mediterranean route and the Central Mediterranean
route. Many migrants who crossed illegally
are expected to continue making secondary
movements within the EU.
Most risks associated with document fraud
were assessed as high. Indeed, document
fraudsters not only undermine border security but also the internal security of the EU.
These risks are common to nearly all Member
States, as they are associated with passenger
flows and border checks, which are a specific expertise of border-control authorities.
Most cases of fraud are expected to involve
EU travel documents and there are indications of a shift away from the use of passports towards less sophisticated documents
such as ID cards and residence permits.
The risks associated with the abuse of legal
channels are often assessed as high as they
are common and widespread phenomena.
Although no reliable measurements exist in
this respect, such abuse probably represents
the easiest and most common modus operandi
used by persons staying illegally in the EU.

1. Introduction
The Frontex Annual Risk Analysis (ARA) 2014
presents a European summary of trends and
developments along the external borders of
the Member States of the EU. This analysis
is based on information provided to Frontex
by the EU Member States and Schengen Associated countries throughout 2013, as well
as information collected during Frontex Joint
Operations and from open sources.
The analysis starts with an overview of the
situation before the border based on data for
Schengen uniform visas. It then looks at the
situation along the external border, based on
trends in regular passenger flows, detections
of illegal border-crossing, clandestine entries
and refusals of entry. Finally, the report provides an update on the situation regarding
persons staying illegally in the EU and thirdcountry nationals returned.
Frontex operational activities aim at strengthening border security by ensuring the coordination of Member States’ actions in the
implementation of Community measures
relating to the management of the external
borders. The coordination of operational ac-

10 of 80

tivities also contributes to better allocation
of Member States’ resources and protection
of the area of freedom, security and justice.
The ARA 2014 concentrates on the current
scope of Frontex operational activities, which
focus on irregular migration at the external
borders of EU Member States and Schengen
Associated Countries. In line with the concept of integrated border management (IBM),
border management should not be limited to
controlling illegal migration but also cover
threats to the EU internal security. Thus a full
section is dedicated to the analysis of crossborder crime.
The Frontex Risk Analysis Unit (RAU) would
like to express its gratitude to all members of
the Frontex Risk Analysis Network (FRAN) in
Member States for their efforts in providing
data and information, as well as to Europol,
European Asylum Support Office (EASO) and
the European Commission, which have contributed to the ARA 2014, and to all Frontex colleagues involved in the preparation
of this report.

2. Methodology
Data exchange
A coherent and full analysis of the risks affecting security at the external borders requires,
above all, the adoption of common indicators. Consistent monitoring of these indicators will then allow effective measures to be
taken on the ground. The analysis will need
to identify the risks that arise at the external borders themselves and those that arise
in third countries.
The backbone of the ARA 2014 is the monthly
statistics exchanged between Member States
within the framework of the Frontex Risk
Analysis Network (FRAN). This regular dataexchange exercise was launched in September 2007 and then refined in 2008. Thanks
to the FRAN members’ efforts, a much larger
statistical coverage was achieved in 2011, focusing on seven key indicators: (1) detections
of illegal border-crossing, (2) refusals of entry,
(3) detections of illegal stay, (4) asylum applications, (5) detections of facilitators, (6) detections of forged documents and (7) return
decisions and effective returns.
Following the closing of the Centre for Information, Discussion and Exchange on
the Crossing of Frontiers and Immigration (CIREFI) working group in April 2010,
most of its mandate, in particular the aspects concerning the exchange of data, were
transferred to the FRAN. Most indicators

monitored by CIREFI had already been part
of the monthly data exchange among FRAN
members and only the statistics on returns
had to be added as the seventh indicator of
the regular data exchange as of January 2011.
In 2011, the original FRAN indicator on forged
documents was updated to enable the analysis of complex modi operandi. Following a
successful pilot study, the European Union Document-Fraud Risk Analysis Network (EDF-RAN) was formed in early 2012
to oversee the exchange of a much more
comprehensive and detailed indicator on document fraud, including the abuse of genuine
documents.
Member States were not requested to answer
specific questions in support of this analysis. Rather, bi-monthly analytical reports
and incident reports of Member States routinely collected within the FRAN and Member States’ contributions to several Tailored
Risk Analyses produced in 2013 were used
as important sources of information, especially as regards the analysis of routes and
modi operandi.
Open-source information was also effectively
exploited, especially in identifying the main
push and pull factors for irregular migration to
the EU. Among others, these sources included

11 of 80

Frontex · annual risk analysis 2014

reports issued by government agencies, international and non-governmental organisations, as well as official EU reports, such as
the European Commission’s reports on third
countries, and mainstream news agencies.
In addition, Frontex organised an Annual Analytical Review to consolidate the risk analyses presented in the FRAN Quarterlies for
2013 and also to gather knowledge on likely
risks of irregular migration at the EU’s external borders. Participants of the FRAN were
invited in January 2014 to review and comment on the risks identified at the external
borders during a one-day exercise.
The data exchange was overseen by Frontex
involving national border-control authorities.
Data were categorised by border type (land,
air and sea) and those on land borders were
additionally categorised by border section
with neighbouring third countries.
The data exchanged within the FRAN are
compiled and analysed on a quarterly basis.
Priority is given to the use of data for management purposes and to its fast sharing
among Member State border-control authorities. Member States’ data processed by
Frontex are not treated as official statistics
and thus may occasionally vary from those
officially published by national authorities.
Throughout 2013, some FRAN members performed backdated updates of their 2012 statistics. These updates have been accounted
for in this document and so some data presented herein may differ from the data presented a year ago in the Annual Risk Analysis
2013.
External borders refer to the borders between
Member States and third countries. The borders, if any, between the Schengen Associated
Countries (Norway, Iceland and Switzerland)
and third countries are also considered as
external borders. The borders between the

12 of 80

Schengen Associated Countries and Schengen Member States are considered as internal
borders. For indicators on detections of facilitators, illegal stay and asylum, statistics are
also reported for detections at the land borders, if any, between the Schengen Member
States and Member States not yet part of the
Schengen area (Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia,
Cyprus) or Member States that have optedout from Schengen (the UK, Ireland), so that
a total for EU Member States and Schengen Associated Countries as a whole can be
presented. It was not possible to make this
distinction for air and sea borders because
Member States do not habitually differentiate between extra-EU and intra-EU air and
sea connections but tend to aggregate data
for all arrivals per airport.
Quality of available data
Consistent with other law-enforcement indicators, variations in administrative data
related to border control depend on several
factors. In this case, the number of detections
of illegal border-crossing and refusals of entry are both functions of the amount of effort spent detecting irregular migrants and
the actual flow of irregular migrants to the
EU. For example, increased detections of illegal border-crossing might be due to a real
increase in the flow of irregular migrants
or may in fact be an outcome of more resources made available to detect them. In
exceptional cases, increased resources may
produce a rise in reported detections while
effectively masking an actual decrease in the
flow of migrants, resulting from a strong deterrent effect.
Conservative estimates of the number of
irregular migrants within the EU vary between 3 and 6 million, according to the results of Clandestino, an EU-sponsored project
implemented by the International Centre
for Migration Policy Development (ICMPD).
Other estimates put the figure of irregular

migrants at 8 million, of which 80% are staying inside the Schengen area, half of them
having originally entered it legally. However,
there is currently no estimate of the annual
flow of persons entering and staying illegally in the EU.
Information on national-level resources for
border-control authorities and their allocation is currently only partially known. These
data are provided by Member States themselves either within the Schengen evaluation
mechanism or within the External Borders
Fund (EBF) reporting. Without systematic
and reliable information on resources allocated to border control and without estimates of irregular migration flows, it is not
possible to assess the performance and impact of the border controls put in place and
the analyses of the situation at the EU’s external borders are limited to descriptive statistics of the administrative data provided by
Member States.
As highlighted in the Schengen Catalogue,
variation in regular passenger flow is an important factor to be taken into account in
the allocation of border-control resources.
However, regular flows of passengers across
the EU’s external borders are currently not
recorded systematically. Some approximations have been arrived at by using availa-

ble Eurostat data on passenger flows at the
air borders and relying on publicly available data on passenger flows across the land
borders received from national border-control authorities.
Data on the number of EU visas issued and
their places of issue would improve the characterisation of third-country passenger flows.
However, this information, which is collected
within the Council’s Visa Working Party and
published by the European Commission, is
not yet available for 2013. For the purpose
of the ARA, data from 2008 to 2012 are discussed as an introduction to the general situation at the borders.
Application of the Common Integrated
Risk Analysis Model (CIRAM)
A key development in the CIRAM 2.0 update released in 2011 was the adoption of a
management approach to risk analysis that
defines risk as a function of the threat, vulnerability and impact. Such an approach endeavours to reflect the spirit of the Schengen
Borders Code and the Frontex Regulation,
both of which emphasise risk analysis as a
key tool in ensuring the optimal allocation of
resources within the constraints of budget,
staff and efficiency of equipment.

3. Situation at the external borders
3.1. Before the border
Issuance of Schengen visas
Visa policy acts as a form of pre-entry procedure to ensure that third-country nationals comply with entry requirements, which
helps to prevent irregular migration. In this
respect, particularly important in preventing subsequent illegal stay is the role of consular offices in third countries determining
whether a third-country national should be
granted a visa or not. Member States have
introduced a variety of specific measures in
their visa-issuing procedures to tackle irregular migration, which includes the assessment
of the willingness to return, the training of
personnel at embassies and consulates, and
cooperation and information exchange with
other entities and Member States. Other
preventive measures include the use of biometric data in the visa application process
and the identification of specific categories
of migrants who might misuse their visa
and raising the awareness in third countries
about the consequences of making fraudulent applications.
The Community Code on Visas, which entered into force in April 2010, sets out the
common requirements for issuing transit
and short-term visas to enter the territory
of Member States. There are currently over
100 nationalities that require a visa to enter
the EU, covering more than 80% of non-EU

population of the world. Nevertheless, about
1 billion nationals from approximately 40 third
countries do not require an EU visa. These include Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand
and the USA. The list of countries whose nationals require a visa to travel to the UK or
Ireland differs slightly from other EU Member
States. As indicated in the Visa Code, statistical data are an important means of monitoring migratory movements and can serve
as an efficient management tool.
Recent changes to Schengen regulations
have seen a simplification of the visa regime.
Schengen Member States now issue only
three types of visa: (1) airport transit visa (A)
– valid only for airport transit, does not entitle the holder to leave the transit zone of
the airport; (2) short-stay visa (C) – valid for
stays of no more than 90 days per period of
180 days; (3) national long-stay visas (D) and
residence permits. The data include visas issued by the Schengen Associated Countries
(Iceland, Norway and Switzerland), but do
not include those issued by Croatia, Cyprus,
Romania and Bulgaria*, which have not yet
joined the Schengen area, nor visas issued
by the UK and Ireland, which are not part of
the Schengen area.
Data on visa issuance by Member States and
third countries of issuance are not yet available for 2013, but the European Commission, through its Directorate-General Home
Affairs, has released the data for 2012. Visa

* Data on visa issued by
Cyprus, Romania and

I­nformation System (VIS) data are collected
on the basis of the place of application rather
than the citizenship of the visa applicant.
Thus, for instance, applications made in the
Russian Federation do not necessarily represent only Russian nationals. However, for
the purpose of the following overview, the
country where the visas were delivered was
used as the most suitable approximation of
the visas issued to citizens of that country.
Visas broken down by nationalities are available at the national level, where they can be
used for operational purposes.
In 2012, a total of 14 250 595 short-term uniform visas were issued, representing an increase of 13% compared to 2011 and a 51%
increase compared to 2009, when 9 420 896
short-term uniform visas were issued. This increase is even more remarkable taking into
account that in 2010 and 2011, five Western
Balkan countries (the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina) saw their visa
requirements to enter the EU lifted, leading
to a landslide decrease in the number of visas
issued in these five countries from 688 531 in
2009 to only 13 893 in 2012.

16 of 80

In fact, most of the visas (59%) were issued
in just three countries: the Russian Federation, which alone accounted for 42% of all visas issued in 2012, with nearly 6 million visas,
as well as Ukraine (1.3 million, 9%) and China
(1.25 million, 8%). There are, however, important differences between these three countries in the purpose of travel and frequency of
trips. Multiple-entry visas accounted for 49%
of all visas issued in the Russian Federation
but only for 13% of those issued in China. Indeed, many Chinese applied for short-term
visas as part of their tourist package in the
EU. According to the World Tourism Organization, China is now the leading nation in
terms of tourism expenditure worldwide and
this trend will further consolidate.
Consistent with the countries where visas
were most issued, seven out of ten Schengen
states’ consulates receiving most short-term
visas applications in 2012 were in the Russian Federation, and the remaining three in
Ukraine, China and Belarus. These ten consulates received 31% of all Schengen visa
applications.
In 2012, the Schengen Member States reporting the issuance of most short-term visas
were France (2.1 million worldwide), Germany

(1.7 million), Spain (1.6 million), Italy (1.6 million)
and Finland (1.4 million, mainly in the Russian Federation). These five Member States
issued 60% of all uniform short-term visas.
Also in 2012, 138 144 short-term visas were
issued at BCPs. The BCPs with most visas
issued were the seaports of Rotterdam, Barcelona and Antwerp.
Table 2 shows the number of visas issued by
the top ten Member States in specific third
countries. The table clearly illustrates a large
increase in the number of visas issued in the
Russian Federation by several Member States.
Visa refusals
The consulate in charge of dealing with visa
applications assesses the applicant’s compliance with entry conditions, the risk of irregular immigration, the applicant’s intention to
leave the territory of the Member State before the expiry of the visa and the risk the
applicant presenting a risk to the security or
public health of the Member State.

As a result, some visa applications are refused.
There are no data on the reasons for refusal of
visa applications, but the overall visa refusal
rate may be determined per third country
where visas are issued. Combined with additional information and tailored to operational
needs, the rate of visa refusals in consulates
may be used by border-control authorities to
determine the countries of origin presenting
the highest risk of irregular migration.
On average, 4.8% of C visa applications were
refused in 2012 (down from 5.5% in 2011). There
are, however, important differences between
Member States (Belgium refuses 16% of applications, while Lithuania and Latvia refuse
around 1% each) and between third countries
(while in Algeria 27% and in Iran 18% of applications are refused, the refusal rate in the
Russian Federation, Belarus and South Africa is below 1%).
Regarding the risk of clandestine entry,
with no reliable measurements in place,
the extent of the phenomenon is probably
underestimated.

At the borders, border controls consist of
border checks and border surveillance. ‘Border checks’ means the checks carried out at
border crossing points, to ensure that persons, including their means of transport and
the objects in their possession, may be authorised to enter the territory of the Member
States or authorised to leave it. EU nationals
are subject to minimal checks, while thirdcountry nationals, whether they require a
visa or not, are subject to thorough checks.
Border checks represent a significant part of
the work of border control authorities and
are directly linked to the flow of passengers.
It is during border checks that a decision,
based on a procedure set in the Schengen
Borders Code, may be taken by border control authorities to refuse entry to third-country nationals. It is also during border checks
that document fraud is detected. These two
aspects, trends in refusals of entry and document frauds, are analysed based on data sent
by Member States to the FRAN.
‘Border surveillance’ means the surveillance
of borders between border crossing points
and the surveillance of border crossing points

18 of 80

outside the fixed opening hours, in order to
prevent persons from circumventing border
checks. It is during surveillance that border
control authorities detected illegal bordercrossings. These detections are the most visible part of border controls and the ones that
are often reported by the media.
Detections of migrants trying to avoid border checks by hiding in vehicles is assimilated
as a particular attempt to circumvent border
checks and referred to as clandestine entries.
As a corollary to strengthened surveillance
and checks along the external borders, border-control authorities are confronted with
the detection of cross-border crimes such as
trafficking in human beings, drug trafficking
and the smuggling of excise goods, as well as
with detections of cross-border crime committed on exit, like the smuggling of stolen
assets, in particular vehicles. Thus, the analysis of cross-border crime forms an integral
part of the description of the situation along
the external borders.
Finally, the analysis of asylum applications
for international protection is also impor-

tant for border-control authorities because
they are often the first authorities asylum
seekers meet, before being referred to asylum authorities.

3.2. At the border
3.2.1. Regular passenger flow
Passenger flow is an indicator of the volume
of checks that border guards have to perform,
relative to the number of border guards. Citizens enjoying free movement are subject to
minimum checks, while third-country nationals, whether they require visas or not, are subject to more thorough checks, as defined by
the Schengen Borders Code. Hence, the nature and volume of passenger flow determine
to a large extent the planning and allocation
of resources for border checks.
Passenger flow data also prove useful in analysing indicators of irregular migration, in
particular refusals of entry and detections
of document fraud. Indeed, differences in
the rates of refusals of entry to overall passenger flow may help identify best practices
and eventually ensure that checks are per-

formed in a harmonised way across the BCPs
of the EU. Similarly, detections of document
fraud are most effectively analysed in connection with passenger flows and detection
rates, rather than the sheer number of detections, and provide the most useful tool for
assessing border checks and flows of document fraudsters.
At European level there is no systematic reporting on passenger flows by BCP, border
section or as a total for the EU’s external border. Member States reported data on passenger flow in the framework of the European
Border Fund (EBF), showing a total of 701
million crossings (entries and exits) in 2011,
excluding the UK and Ireland, which do not
participate in the EBF, and including crossings between non-Schengen and Schengen
Member States (France-UK, Belgium-UK, Romania-Hungary). This total consists of 384
million passengers crossing at the air border,
233 million at the land border and 84 million
at the sea border. However, the total for the
air border represents all passenger flows, including passengers from EU countries. Eurostat provides data on air passenger flows (EU
nationals and third-country nationals) coming
only from third countries, which totalled 125
million in 2011, including the UK and Ireland.
The EBF total for sea border-crossing appears
very large, but probably also includes crossings between Member States. Given these
uncertainties, it is difficult to estimate the
EU total passenger flow from third countries that could usefully be analysed against
the number of refusals of entry and detections of fraudulent documents.
As traveller numbers continue to rise, it can
be expected that the current infrastructure
at BCPs will have greater difficulties in dealing with increased throughput. The dual objective of facilitating travel and maintaining
security requires the introduction of new approaches and innovative solutions to border
management.

Air borders
At the air border, Member State border-control authorities do not collect data on passengers going through border checks in a
systematic way. Some Member States have
systems in place that record the number and
nationality of the passengers in detail, but
most Member States do not directly collect detailed statistics but rely on information provided by air carriers. One of the main
difficulties in estimating the flow of passengers through the external borders at the air
border is that passengers coming from third
countries and passengers coming from nonSchengen Member States go through the
same booths and so there is no way to distinguish the two flows.
At the air border, data from Eurostat on extra-EU arrivals are the best approximation of
the flow of passengers, but this flow does not

correspond to the total flow of passengers
going through border checks as it does not
take into account the flow between Schengen and non-Schengen Member States.
Eurostat data showed that intra-EU arrivals
(460 million) were approximately four times
larger than extra-EU arrivals (125 million) at
main EU airports in 2012. Extra-EU arrivals
in 2012 showed a steady trend of +2% compared to 2011. The UK and Germany are the
two Member States reporting the largest
number of extra-EU arrivals, each reporting
more than 20 million. France follows with
18 million extra-EU arrivals. Together, the
UK, Germany and France account for 61% of
all extra-EU arrivals.
In 2012, the largest numbers of extra-EU arrivals were reported from London Heathrow
(LHR) with more than 18 million passengers,
followed by Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG)

­ irport (13 million) and Frankfurt am Main
a
(FRA) airport (12 million).
Extra-EU arrivals by air demonstrate a clear
seasonal pattern with many more passengers
arriving in the summer holiday period. In the
light of the total 2012 data for 27 EU Member
States, during the first months of the year the
passenger air flow is around 11 million passengers per month, followed by a steady increase in the number of passengers during
the months of June and July, reaching a peak
in August, with approximately 17 million passengers. After this time, the number of passengers starts to gradually fall off over the
subsequent months, reaching its low in November and December, at around 10 million
passengers. There is thus an increase of nearly
70% between the month with the smallest
flow and the month with the largest flow.
Third-country airports of departure to
the EU
The main two airports with the largest number of departures to the EU in 2012 were
the Turkish airports of Istanbul Atatürk (IST)
and Antalya Airport (AYT), which reached
around 6 million passengers during the year.
Dubai International Airport (DXB), with an
increasing trend since 2009, and New York
John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK)
also ranked top reaching more than 5 million

22 of 80

passengers in 2012. Other airports located
in countries such as the Russian Federation, Israel and the USA accounted for a significant volume of passengers in 2012. The
flights departing from the Turkish airports
and from the USA had the airports of Düsseldorf (DUS) and London Heathrow (LHR)
as main destinations.
The main increases in regular air
passenger flow between 2011 and 2012
The route with the highest increase from 2011
to 2012 on extra-EU flights runs from Ukraine
to Italy, with a sharp increase of passengers
on the route between the Ukrainian airport
in Kyiv (KBP) and the Italian airport of Treviso
(TSF), in the north of Italy (+279%). There was
also a large increase on the route connecting
Moscow Vnukovo (VKO) and the Italian airport of Federico Fellini International Airport
(RMI) in Rimini (+138%). Although the total
number of passengers is relatively low, the
development of new air routes is important
to follow because it requires border-control
authorities to get acquainted with new passenger profiles, including in some cases updating their knowledge on travel documents
that were not commonly encountered before
the development of these new routes. Cooperation with other EU airports with similar third-country departure airports speeds
up the learning process.

Since 2009, the route from Moscow Sheremetyevo International Airport (SVO) to Lennart
Meri Airport in Tallinn (TLL) has also shown a
continuous growth, with around 46 000 passengers in 2012, resulting in a 114% increase
from 2011 to 2012.
Dubai International Airport (DXB) also ranked
top among the airports with the highest increase in passengers on flights coming to the
EU. From 2011 to 2012 there were almost three
times more passengers flying from Dubai to
Copenhagen Airport (CPH) in Denmark. To a
lesser extent, the number of passengers flying from Dubai to Geneva (GVA) also showed
a strong increase of 89% in 2012.
Land borders
Information available on passenger traffic at
the external land borders of the EU is scarce.
Although it appears fundamental to risk analysis, policy making and resource allocation,
not all Member States count every traveller
crossing land borders and the practices for
counting travellers and vehicles vary considerably among Member States.
The only reliable comparative data available
come from the SCIFA data collection exercise

conducted for one week, from 31 August to
6 September 2009, which offers some evidence of the importance of cross-border flows
at land borders.* Land BCPs follow air borders
closely in terms of the total volume of entries and exits. However, between 2009 and
2013, passenger flows increased more rapidly at the land border than at the air border
in the wake of visa liberalisation for Western
Balkan countries and the implementation of
local border traffic agreements. It is now assumed that there are more passengers crossing at the land border than at the air border.

* Best Practices in border
checks at EU land Border
Crossing Points, Frontex,
June 2013

The SCIFA data collection exercise also revealed, at least in 2009, a different composition of passenger flow at the land and at
the air border, with a larger proportion of
third-country nationals requiring thorough
checks on entry, in line with the Schengen
Borders Code, at the land border (53% of the
flow) than at the air border (40%). This variation is likely larger in 2013, representing a
significant load on the external land borders.
Importantly, the proportion of border-crossings by third-country nationals to the total
number of entries/exits varies widely among
Member States. For example, in 2010 in Poland this ratio was almost three times greater

more easily standardised. Moreover, the rate
at which traffic flows across land BCPs are
determined not only by Member States but
also by the practices of neighbouring third
countries. Bilateral cooperation is thus fundamental to facilitating transit. Unlike at the
air border, early warnings at land BCPs are
rarely available, which limits the ability of border management authorities to allocate resources in advance. Finally, land borders can
be subject to massive or emergency flows,
for which contingency planning is necessary.
Local border traffic agreements
A local border traffic agreement (LBTA) provides for the issuance of permits entitling
border residents to cross an external land
border under the local border traffic regime.
This must be done in compliance with the relevant provisions of Council Regulation (EC)
No 1030 / 2002 of 13 June 2002 laying down
a uniform format for residence permits for
third-country nationals.

than in Hungary, while the estimated volume of total traffic in these two countries
was comparable (see Tab. 6).
The SCIFA exercise also concluded that road
BCPs account for a much larger proportion
of traveller traffic (around 95% of all bordercrossings) than rail BCPs. It is reasonable to
assume that there are significant seasonal
differences in the flows at land BCPs across
the EU, considering, for example, much larger
flows during the summer holiday period.
Land BCP check practices and land BCPs
themselves vary widely. This sets them apart
from air borders, as airports constitute a controlled environment where practices can be

In general, LBTA permits do not include other
biometric identifiers besides the photograph
of the holder, although some Member States
(e.g. Poland and Slovakia) appear to be considering the option of adding supplementary
biometrics in the future. In light of the mandatory introduction of fingerprint checks in
the VIS at land borders from October 2014,
a number of questions arise. Assuming that
visa policy remains the same and the citizens of a number of neighbouring countries
continue to be visa-required, it remains uncertain whether LBTA card holders will be exempt from the requirement to provide their
fingerprints. If so, then it is likely that LBTA
cards might become more popular, but also
more targeted by organised criminal groups
as a way of avoiding the fingerprint check.
If no, then all Member States’ national LBTA
card issuance systems will have to be reorganised to include fingerprints on the card.

3.2.2. Refusals of entry

Figure 6. In line with growing passenger flow, refusals of entry
increased most at the land border

According to the Schengen Borders Code,
third countries nationals arriving at the external borders may be refused entry into the EU
if not fulfilling all the entry conditions. There
are nine reasons to refuse entry and they are
all listed in the Schengen Borders Code. The
Schengen Borders Code also describes the
standard refusal form to be issued to each
person refused entry into the EU.

Refusals of entry in 2009–2013, by border type

Refusals of entry rose by 11% between 2012 and
2013, to 128 902. While most refusals of entry
are reported from the land and air borders, in
line with the distribution of passenger flows,
the long-term trend is an increase at the land
border due to increasing passenger flow. At the
EU level, Russians ranked first for refusals of
entry, followed by Ukrainians and Albanians.

10 000

At the land borders, most refusals of entry
(more than 50 000) were reported at the
eastern land borders, in particular at the land
border between Poland and Belarus. Most
of these refusals concerned citizens of the

3.2.3. Document fraud

Refusals of entry issued to nationals from Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia in 2009–2013, by border type

Document fraud involving either authentic
or false documents is an important challenge
for border control and internal security, as it
allows migrants in irregular or unlawful situations not only to enter the territory of a
Member State, but then also to move freely
within the Schengen area and to non-Schengen EU Member States.

April 2013, the monthly number of refusals
of entry to Russians at the Polish-Belarusian
land border remained larger than in the corresponding months of 2012. The reasons behind this sudden and large increase are not
fully understood. There was no particular security or political incidents in Chechnya immediately before or during that period, and
the economic situation, while relatively poor,
did not change drastically either. This sudden
flow could have been triggered by rumours
spreading in Chechnya about Germany granting asylum to Russians of Chechen origin.
In the Western Balkans, visa liberalisation
granted to citizens of Serbia, Montenegro,
Bosnia and Herzegovina, the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia and Albania increased
both passenger flow and refusals of entry.
In terms of volume, the increase was much
stronger at the land border, from 7 146 in 2009
to 19 275 in 2013, than at the air border, from
1 109 to 4 431, reflecting the preferred choice
of transport for most Western Balkan nationals travelling to the EU. Refusals of entry to
Western Balkan country nationals with the
visa-free status accounted for 20% of all refusals in the EU in 2013, while this proportion
was only of 13% in 2010, i.e. before visa liberalisation. This highlights the increased workload of border-control authorities.

It is generally recognised that document fraud
poses significant risks: Individuals assuming
a bogus identity and operating in the black
market seriously affect internal security and
undermine international criminal investigations, as well as national social systems and
the ability of any state to effectively manage
and protect its legitimate communities. Document fraud also creates strong links to organised crime groups (OCGs) and generates
their proceeds, because modern documents
require more sophisticated and expensive
techniques to produce quality forgeries.
Document fraud can involve the use of both
authentic and false documents and can be
classified in the following four categories:
False documents:
n forgeries – previously authentic documents that have been tampered with or
‘falsified’;
n counterfeits – entirely manufactured documents made to resemble originals
Authentic documents:
n fraudulently obtained documents – documents that were issued based on fraudulent applications or supporting documents;
n impostors – documents being used by an
unauthorised user (look-alikes).
The abuse of EU passports is of particular
concern because migrants using them may
be subject to less rigorous checks at the external border, and because documents may

Modern, sophisticated documents are more
difficult to falsify or reproduce than documents issued some years ago. As a result
there has been a consistent move towards
the abuse of genuine documents (which do
not require forgery techniques) either by using
someone else’s document, i.e. acting as impostors or by obtaining genuine documents
based on fraudulent applications. Many experts suggest that a strengthening of registration and issuing procedures, coupled
with more sophisticated and standardised
breeder documents are needed to overcome
the growing threat of the abuse of genuine
documents.
The European Union Document-Fraud
Risk Analysis Network
To address the need for standardised information exchange in the field of detected
fraudulent documents, the European Union Document-Fraud Risk Analysis Network (EDF-RAN) was formed in early 2012
to serve as a platform for information exchange among Member States. Overseen
by Frontex, during 2013 some 29 Member
States / Schengen Associated Countries met
to exchange information on several occasions and maintained and developed the detailed and complex monthly data-exchange
covering all detections of document fraud at
the external border and on all international
flights. Depersonalised data on document

also be used to access social systems or be
subsequently reused by other migrants attempting illegal entry. Another major issue
relates to fraudulently obtained visas, which
raise particular challenges for first-line officers to detect, especially given linguistic differences and the fact that migrants are not
required to cross the external border of the
Member State that issued the visa. Some of
these issues will be addressed by the Visa Information System (VIS), which will conclude
its staggered roll-out by the end of 2014.

more difficult to falsify and reproduce yet fraudulently obtained visas
may be particularly hard to detect by first-line officers

According to EDF-RAN data, in 2013 there
were nearly 10 000 detections of migrants
using fraudulent documents to attempt illegal entry to the EU/Schengen area from third
countries, which is an increase of 24% compared to the previous year (Fig. 10). Some of
this increase was due to more countries parFigure 10. Reported detections of document fraud on entry to the

ticipating in the EDF in 2013 and also probably because of steadily more consistent and
well-defined reporting within the framework
of the EDF-RAN. However, there was also evidence of a significant increase in detections
of document fraud across the EU, particularly
in terms of authentic documents.

widely believed to be in response to modern
sophisticated documents being more difficult
to falsify or reproduce. In 2013 document experts and border guards raised concerns that
more authentic documents were also being
fraudulently obtained as another alternative
to producing expensive falsifications.

In 2013, nearly three-quarters of detections
of document fraud were at the external air,
rather than sea or land borders.

Because more countries participated in the
EDF-RAN in 2013, the total number of detections of authentic documents would also be
expected to increase, even in the absence of
any change in relative detections of different
modi operandi. To assess the degree to which
authentic documents are becoming more
commonly used as a modus operandi, it is necessary to look at the proportion of overall
detections of document fraud that involved
authentic documents. Analyses were repeated
excluding countries that joined the EDF-RAN
in 2013, with no difference to the results.

Detections were clumped among a small
number or airports which detected very high
numbers of fraudulent documents. For example, the top five airports (Paris Charles de
Gaulle, Rome Fiumicino, Madrid, Lisbon and
London Heathrow) reported nearly half of all
detections at the external air border. At the
land border, BCPs between Greece and Albania, between Bulgaria and Turkey and between Ukraine and both Poland and Hungary
were all significant in terms of detections of
document fraud.
Modi operandi
Recent years have seen increased detections
of impostors using genuine documents. This is

28 of 80

EDF-RAN data confirm that authentic passports were detected proportionally more
frequently in 2013 than in previous years
(Fig. 11), suggesting that abuse of authentic
documents is an increasing modus operandi to
illegally enter the EU/Schengen area. For example, in 2012 impostors and fraudulently ob-

tained documents represented 23% and 4% of
overall passport fraud, respectively, whereas
in 2013 these proportions increased to 28%
and 6%, indicating that this type of abuse is
becoming more common at the expense of
other modi operandi.
Trends
Back in 2012 the most commonly detected
type of document fraud was the use of counterfeit border-crossing stamps to fabricate
travel histories and extend periods of stay in
the Schengen area. This type of fraud was associated with Ukrainian nationals detected at
their land border with Poland and Ukraine and
was indicative of circular migration patterns.
However, the majority of migrants abusing
border-crossing stamps in 2012 were from Albania most frequently detected at their land
border with Greece. Albanians were not only
detected here but were also very frequently
detected attempting to enter the UK from the
Schengen area, often using counterfeit Italian
ID cards. The combination of these two phenomena rendered Albanians the nationality
most associated with document fraud in 2012.
In 2013, detections of Albanians fell by half but
they were still ranked second at the EU level.
Albanians were mostly detected at the Greek
and, to a lesser extent, the Croatian land border but also at the Spanish air border. Counterfeit Greek border-crossing stamps were
still the most commonly detected fraudulent
document at the EU level in 2013.
In 2013, following a threefold increase compared to the year before, Syrian irregular
migrants were by far the most commonly
detected document fraudsters in the EU.
They were most commonly detected at the
German, Italian, Portuguese and Austrian
air borders, as well as at Kapitan Andreevo,
a Bulgarian land BCP with Turkey. Some EU
airports tend to distrust claimed nationalities and so report very large volumes of de-

tections of unknown nationalities. However,
a comparative analysis suggests that many
of these unknown nationalities are actually Syrians, which would mean that the figures presented here are an underestimation
of the actual numbers of Syrians arriving
in the EU / Schengen area with fraudulent
documents.
Another key hotspot for detections of document fraud of a single nationality was visible in detections of Moroccans at the Spanish
sea border. In this case detections were exclusively reported from the Spanish cities of
Ceuta and Melilla, where Moroccans were
detected using a broad suite of authentic
documents as impostors. These document
included Spanish ID cards and residence permits, and Moroccan passports presumably
with valid visas contained within.
3.2.4. Illegal border-crossing
Detections of illegal border-crossing along the
EU’s external borders sharply increased between 2012 and 2013, from 72 437 to 107 365,
which represented an annual increase of 48%.
Although significant, the 2013 level is comparable to the totals reported by Member States
in 2009 and 2010 (104 599 and 104 060, respectively) and is still lower than the total reported during the Arab Spring in 2011 (141 051).
Apart from this rising trend, the year 2013
was characterised by three phenomena: a
large increase in illegal border-crossings by
Syrians (subsequently applying for asylum)
on the Eastern Mediterranean route and in
the Central Mediterranean; a steady flow of
migrants departing from North Africa (Libya
and Egypt) putting their life at risk to cross
the Mediterranean Sea; and a sharp increase,
mostly in January-June, in detections reported
on the Western Balkan route.
In 2013, there was also a sharp contrast
between the beginning of the year, which
started with the lowest quarterly total re-

29 of 80

corded since 2009 (9 717 in Q1 2013), and
the third quarter, which reported one of the
highest quarterly totals (42 789 detections in
Q3 2013). This swift fluctuation in less than
six months shows the rapidly evolving situation at the external border and the difficulty
in forecasting flows that appear to be driven
as much by local circumstances as by development outside the EU.

through Libya, where they are often ostracised, and then cross the Mediterranean Sea.

In terms of nationalities, Syrians, Eritreans,
Afghans and Albanians together accounted
for 52% of total detections (or 55 359). Syrians
alone (25 546) represented almost a quarter
of the total. Their detections at the EU border tripled between 2012 and 2013. Unlike
in previous years when the top nationality
tended to be reported from only a few border areas, suggesting that the flows were
controlled by a limited number of facilitators, Syrians were reported as the top nationality detected illegally crossing in most
border areas. They were also the top nationality for other indicators, in particular asylum
applications, reflecting the dire situation in
Syria and the desperate plight of Syrian asylum seekers. Border-control authorities, often the first authorities they encountered,
received their requests for asylum and referred them to asylum authorities.

The number of detected Albanians was similar to that of Afghans, with 9 021 detections,
mostly reported from the land border between Greece and Albania. This was an increase of 60% and came after two years of
relatively low detections, with about 5 000
detections in 2011 and 2012.

Eritreans ranked second in 2013, with 11 298
detections, or 11% of the total. This represented one of the most significant increases
(fourfold), as their detections in 2012 totalled
2 604. The vast majority of Eritreans were detected on the Central Mediterranean route
(9 926, or nearly 90%), after departing from
Libya. Following a similar route, Somalis were
also detected in large numbers in 2013 (5 624),
which level is comparable to 2012 (5 038). Altogether, detections of Eritreans and Somalis
totalled 16 922, or 16% of all detections. This
relatively large share shows the importance
of the migration flow from the Horn of Africa to the EU, a flow that is often perilous
as migrants have to cross the Sahara, transit

30 of 80

Detections of Afghans sharply decreased to
about 9 500 in 2013, down from 13 169 detections in 2012 and nearly 26 000 in 2010.
In nearly all indicators, Afghans were at their
lowest level since 2009, suggesting a pause
in their movements to the EU in 2013.

Although they do not appear among the top
nationalities, detections of Nigerians (3 386),
Malians (2 887), Senegalese (1 643) and Gambians (2 817) all quadrupled or more compared
to 2012. Together they totalled 10 733 detections (10% of all), and were mostly reported
from the Central Mediterranean.
Routes
In the annual total for 2013, detections of illegal border-crossing on the Central Mediterranean route accounted for the largest
percentage of all detections (40 304, or 38%
of the total). This represented a fourfold increase in detections compared to 2012, but
the 2013 total remained below the detections reported in 2011, i.e. the year of the Arab
Spring. Closely related are also the detections
in the area of Apulia and Calabria, mostly
linked to departures from the Eastern Mediterranean, totalling nearly 5 000 detections.
Detections on the Eastern Mediterranean
route continued to drop, from a peak of
57 025 in 2011 to 37 214 in 2012 and 24 799 in
2013. Detections were roughly equally distributed between the Eastern Aegean Sea
and the land borders with Turkey. Detec-

tions reported from the land border between
Greece and Turkey remained low throughout the year. The decrease compared to previous years followed the strengthening of
border surveillance on the Greek side, including the completion of a fence along the
12-kilometre land connection with Turkey,
and deployment of additional staff to patrol the area of the River Evros marking the
land border between Turkey and Greece.
Greece also took a series of measures inland (i.e. changes in the asylum policy and
return measures), which resulted in curbing
illegal immigration.

The situation remained relatively stable in the
Western Mediterranean (6 838, compared to
6 397 in 2012) and along the eastern land border (1 316, compared to 1 597 in 2012).
n Central Mediterranean route

Detections on the Western Balkan route rose
sharply to a record level of 19 951 detections.
In July, the number of detections started to
fall, but stayed above the level of 2012.

In the Central Mediterranean area, the large
and sudden increase in detections in 2011, following the turmoil in Tunisia and Libya, had
been significantly reduced by the end of 2011,
but resumed in 2012. In 2013, the number of
detections was low in the first quarter, but
gradually increased from the second quarter
to reach a peak in the third. Out of the annual total of 40 304 detections, 75% were reported in only four months, i.e. between July
and October 2013, with a peak in September,
a pattern also observed in 2012.

Circular migration between Albania and
Greece increased markedly between 2012
and 2013 (8 729, +59%), but the 2013 total
remains below the number of detections
in 2009 (40 250) and 2010 (35 297), corresponding to the period before visa liberalisation for Albanians.

Tragically, this period of an intense flow of
migrants between North Africa and the EU
saw several major incidents of boats capsizing in the region resulting in a massive loss
of life, including women and children. These
events were widely reported in the media
and attracted a lot of political attention to

Mediterranean routes

the issue of irregular migration in the Mediterranean in general, including several statements released by the EU Commissioner for
Home Affairs.
Since then, detections of migrants have
dropped considerably from nearly 8 000
detections in October to 1 297 in November
2013, but this decrease also coincided with
the traditional winter low period when rough

sea conditions render sailing hazardous. A
closer analysis of the data showed that, compared to previous years, detections in December 2013 (2 476) were the largest for a
month of December since 2008, when systematic data monitoring started. This indicates the determination of migrants stranded
in Libya, mostly sub-Saharans and Syrians,
to sail to the EU despite the difficult winter conditions.

An increased use of rubber boats has also
been reported, mostly by sub-Saharans. Compared to fishing boats, rubber boats put migrants’ lives at a greater risk, but offer the
cheapest sailing option. On the other hand,
when fishing boats or larger boats are used,
they tend to be overcrowded, which also increases the risk of them capsizing. To prevent
this, search and rescue operations are undertaken ever closer to the Libyan coast. However, the awareness of these measures among
facilitators and migrants decreases their overall perception of risk taken when embarking
on what remains a perilous journey.
Nationalities
Together, nationals from the Horn of Africa,
in this case Eritreans (9 926) and Somalis
(4 497), represented the largest proportion
of detections on the Central Mediterranean
route, totalling 14 423, or 36%. During interviews conducted in the framework of the JO
Hermes, most Eritreans and Somalis indicated
that they had left their countries due to security and economic and concerns. Somalis

34 of 80

and Eritreans reported using the same route
through Ethiopia and Sudan.
Syrian migrants ranked second in the annual total for 2013, with 9 591 detections,
representing nearly a quarter of the total.
Many departed from Libya’s coastal area
near Zuwarah, but the largest proportion
departed from Egypt. They often travelled
in family units.
Overall, three main flows can be distinguished
departing from Libya: (1) Syrians, often arriving from Egypt and departing on wooden
boats from Zuwarah on the western Libyan
coast, which offers the shortest connection
to the EU’s southern external border; (2) nationals from the Horn of Africa; and (3) nationals from West Africa.
Egyptian migrants were also reported on the
Central Mediterranean route, with 1 982 detections in 2013.

n Eastern Mediterranean route
Since data collection began in early 2008,
the Eastern Mediterranean has maintained
its status as a hotspot of irregular migration.
However, following the implementation of a
set of Greek operations in August 2012 as well
as the continued implementation of Frontexcoordinated Joint Operations (Poseidon Sea
and Land), detections significantly dropped
at the Greek-Turkish land border. In 2013, the
figure was the lowest reported on this route
since 2009, but the route still ranked second
and accounted for nearly a quarter of all detections for illegal border-crossing to the EU.
Compared to 2011 and 2012, the areas of detections also considerably changed, and detections in the Eastern Aegean Sea were the
largest, followed by detections along the land
border between Bulgaria and Turkey.
Syrians represented more than half of all detections on this route (12 727, or 51%) and although they were mostly reported at the
land border between Bulgaria and Turkey
and in the Eastern Aegean Sea, they were
also the single most detected nationality at
the land border between Greece and Turkey,

and in Cyprus. Most of them were travelling
in family groups. Many applied for asylum in
Bulgaria immediately after their detection,
as well as in other Member States, but very
few applied for asylum in Greece.
Afghans ranked second (6 129), mostly detected in the Eastern Aegean Sea, but their
detections were considerably reduced after
the peak of 2011 (19 618). Similarly, as compared
to 2011, detections of illegally staying Afghans
also decreased, from 25 296 in 2011 to 16 836
in 2013, as did the number of Afghans applying for asylum (FRAN data), from 29 672 in
2011 to 24 060 in 2013. These concurrent decreases occur at a time of growing uncertainties for many Afghans living in Afghanistan or
as refugees in neighbouring Iran and Pakistan.
Detections of Africans has also considerably decreased on the Eastern Mediterranean
route, from 8 479 in 2012 to 3 460 in 2013.
Bulgarian land border
In this border area, detections considerably
increased between August 2012 and October 2013, after which they fell sharply. This
decrease coincided with a strengthening of

surveillance efforts at the land border between Bulgaria and Turkey and the deployment of additional staff (police and border
police officers).
Most migrants crossed the land border with
the help of local residents from the area of
Edirne who were either working for the facilitation networks based in Istanbul or were
operating independently.
Most detections in this area concerned Syrians. After detections, most Syrians applied
for asylum. Their number is still small compared with more than 2 million who have
sought shelter elsewhere according to data
available at the end of 2013, but has placed
serious strain on Bulgarian resources. While
some Syrians opted to stay in Bulgaria, others, mostly those with relatives or acquaintances in other Member States, preferred to
continue mostly to Germany or Sweden.

As at other border sections of the Eastern
Mediterranean route Syrians ranked first.
The low number of detections followed the
strengthening of border surveillance on the
Greek side in 2012, including the completion
of a fence along the 12-kilometre land connection with Turkey, and deployment of additional staff to patrol the area of the River
Evros marking the land border between Turkey and Greece.
Information reported by the Turkish authorities also suggest a continued presence of
migrants on the Turkish side of the border.
While most will eventually opt to cross by
sea or across the neighbouring land border
to Bulgaria, it is important to highlight that
the pressure of illegal migration on the GreekTurkish land border section remains higher
than the data on detections for illegal border-crossing may suggest.
Eastern Aegean Sea

Greek land border
In 2013, at the land border between Greece
and Turkey, detections remained very low.

36 of 80

In the Aegean Sea, most of migrants targeted
the islands of Lesvos and Samos. However,
detections were reported also elsewhere

in the Eastern Aegean Sea, covering a large
area from Samothrace Island in the north
(reporting its first detections) to Megisti Island in the south.
Nearly 70% of the migrants who had entered
illegally through the Eastern Aegean Sea were
detected on the islands after their crossing.
Detections also occurred in the Ionian Sea
while migrants were trying to reach Italy.

© Frontex, 2014

At the beginning of 2013, most migrants crossing the Eastern Aegean Sea were Afghans, but
gradually Syrians have become the main nationality reported for illegal border-crossing.
n Western Balkan route
Figure 17. Most irregular migrants crossed
the land border between Turkey and
Bulgaria with the help of local residents

Detections of illegal border-crossing strongly
increased on the Western Balkan route, from
6 391 in 2012 to 19 951 in 2013, reaching a record high since data collection began in 2008.
Most of the detections were reported between January and June 2013 at the land border between Hungary and Serbia. During that
period, migrants detected crossing the border illegally immediately applied for asylum
and soon absconded to continue their journey to other Member States. In July, coinciding

with an amendment in the Hungarian asylum
policy, the number of detections started to
decrease, but nevertheless remained higher
than in previous years.

detected for illegal border-crossing, repre-

senting 32% of all detections on this route.
However, their detections were concentrated
between April and July 2013 (81% of their 2013
total), and dropped to a negligible level after July 2013. This drop followed return flights
from Hungary to Pristina that were accompanied by a media campaign in Kosovo* to
prevent illegal migration.
Detections of other nationalities, notably
from Pakistan and Afghanistan, also dropped
after July 2013, but remained higher than in
the previous year. African and Asian migrants
detected at the land border between Hungary and Serbia had originally crossed illegally
the external border on the Eastern Mediterranean route and then transited through the
Western Balkans mostly via the border between Greece and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and increasingly via the
Bulgarian-Serbian border.
The accession of Croatia to the EU on 1 July
2013 did not affect the movements of migrants across the Western Balkans. The border section between Hungary and Serbia
remained the main border section for most

38 of 80

migrants to attempt illegal entry to the EU.
In addition, this border section also recorded
a large increase in the traffic flow after 2011,
in the wake of the visa liberalisation process,
resulting in a surge in refusals of entry. Border-control authorities, at a time of budgetary constraints, have thus had to face new
challenges simultaneously on the green border and at BCPs.
n C
 ircular route between Albania and
Greece
In 2013, Greece reported 8 728 detections of
illegal border-crossing at its land border with
Albania and with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, of which 8 592 were associated with Albanians. This represented a 59%
rise in relation to a year previously.
This substantial increase broke the stable
situation in place since 2011, when visa liberalisation was granted to Albanians. Prior
to visa liberalisation, detections had ranged
between 38 000 and 30 000 a year. However, since 2011, annual detections of illegal
border-crossing have been around 5 000.

The introduction of visa liberalisation went
together with a small increase in refusals of
entry as more Albanians crossed the border at BCPs.
n Western Mediterranean route
In 2013 there were 6 838 detections of illegal
border-crossing in the Western Mediterranean region, which consists of several areas of
the southern Spanish coast and the land borders of Ceuta and Melilla. This total is comparable to the total of 6 397 reported in 2012.
In 2013, nearly two-thirds of the detections
were reported at the land border in Ceuta and
Melilla. This is probably associated with more
effective prevention of departures at sea by
the Moroccan authorities and enhanced prevention measures in the Mediterranean Sea,
including the EPN JO Indalo. This assumption
is supported by the fact that the improvement
of weather conditions in the summer did not
result in a significant increase in detections
at the sea border in this region.
Several times in 2013, the Spanish authorities
warned of the permanent threat of migration
to Melilla. Indeed, there were several violent
incidents of migrants attempting to cross the
fence in large groups (more than a hundred
persons), sometimes resulting in casualties.
Once in Melilla, migrants are turned over to
Spanish Police Headquarters for identification, and many are transferred to the Temporary Centre for Immigrants (CETI – Centro
de Estancia Temporal de Inmigrantes). However this centre only has a limited capacity
and some migrants had to be transferred to
mainland Spain.
The analysis of nationality is problematic as
most of the detections reported by Spain are
of unknown nationalities; however, most are
assumed to be sub-Saharans. There is a reluctance of the vast majority of migrants to
cooperate with the authorities.

n Apulia and Calabria
In Apulia and Calabria in southern Italy, detections tend to be associated with different
movements of irregular migration. Most of
the detections in the area of Apulia are linked
to secondary movements from Greece to Italy, while most of the detections in Calabria
are associated with migrants who departed
from Turkey or Egypt and sailed across the
Aegean Sea towards Italy.
In 2013, detections were stable with a total
of 4 994 compared to 4 772 in 2012. As in previous years, most migrants were nationals
from Asian and Middle East countries. Syrians, ranking first, represented 38% of all the
detections on this route.
Syrian migrants, acting on family advice, tend
to refuse to be fingerprinted and travel to
Catania and Syracuse, where a large number
of Syrians have successfully landed over the
past few months. Many continue their journey to Sweden or Germany where the new
migrants apply for asylum.
As on the Central Mediterranean area, detections started to increase in spring and peaked
in November 2013. The sharpest increases
were of Syrians and Eritreans, together with
large numbers of arriving Egyptians. Most
of these migrants are thought to have departed from North Africa, specifically Egypt.
In contrast to these increasing trends, the
number of Pakistanis and Afghans, declined
compared to 2012.
Detections in Calabria were mostly associated with departures from Turkey and Egypt,
and the main nationality detected there were
Syrians. Many migrants reported transhipment in high seas from large fishing boats
to smaller wooden boats to reach the shores
(mother boat modus operandi).

Frontex · annual risk analysis 2014

n Black Sea route
Detections of illegal border-crossing on the
Black Sea are extremely rare, but in 2013 Bulgaria reported one attempt of clandestine
entry at Varna seaport in June and Romania
reported four incidents involving the detection of 118 migrants often aided by Turkish
facilitators attempting to reach the Romanian coast. The migrants were mostly Syrians or Afghans.
These incidents still constitute isolated cases,
and are possibly linked to the increased surveillance on the Eastern Mediterranean route
and the increasing number of migrants waiting in Turkey to reach the EU illegally. However, while these four cases should be taken
extremely seriously, they are not yet a signal
of larger shifts towards Romania.
n Eastern land border route
The eastern land border route is, in effect,
an amalgam of detections of illegal bordercrossing reported by Finland, Estonia, Latvia,
Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania. Despite the total length of all the border sections, detections on this route tend to
be lower than on other routes, possibly due
to the long distances from many countries
of origin. Also, according to several reports
shared during 2013, visa fraud and counterfeit border-crossing stamps tend to predominate on this route, as opposed to detections
of illegal border-crossing.
Detections of illegal border-crossing remained stable between 2012 and 2013, with
1 316 detections (compared to 1 597 in 2012).
Similarly to previous years, most of the detections were reported from the land border between Slovakia and Ukraine. Estonia
reported an increase, but a large proportion
of these detections were connected with
the smuggling of goods rather then irregular migration.

40 of 80

In terms of nationalities, Georgians ranked
first, mostly detected at the land border between Lithuania and Belarus, followed by Afghans, mostly detected at the land border
between Slovakia and Ukraine.
Detections of illegal border-crossing are also
kept at low levels along the eastern land
border thanks to the surveillance efforts of
neighbouring third countries, in particular
the Russian Federation and Belarus. Most
part of the border with Belarus is fenced on
the Belarusian side. In 2013, a new fence has
been constructed on the green border between Norway and the Russian Federation.
This fence will enable the Russian authorities to re-deploy human resources to other
parts of the Russian border.
While the threat of illegal border-crossing
between BCPs along the eastern land border
seems to be lower than at other sections of
the external land border of the EU, this border section is faced with increasing passenger and lorry traffic, which requires additional
efforts from border-control authorities.
Also, the issue of migrants refused entry and
then applying for asylum and absconding
from reception centres is the most serious
along the eastern land borders. In 2013, it is
estimated, based on data for refusals of entry
to Poland and asylum applications in Poland
and Germany, that about 15 000 Russians of
Chechen origin used this modus operandi and
subsequently stayed illegally in the EU. For
comparison, this is twice the number of detections of illegal border-crossing reported on
the Western Mediterranean route (6 838), half
of those reported on the Eastern Mediterranean route (24 799), or 4% of all detections
of persons staying illegally in the EU in 2013.
The use of this modus operandi at the eastern
border appears to be a significant entry channel of illegal migration to the EU. It exploits
legal loopholes while still absorbing an important part of the resources at the border.

© Frontex, 2013

© Frontex, 2013

Figure 20. The low number of detections probably underestimates the actual scale of
clandestine entry of migrants hiding in lorries or private cars

3.2.5. Clandestine entries
Detections of clandestine entry in vehicles
should be analysed in connection with the
type and number of vehicles crossing through
BCPs. However, as for passenger flow, data on
regular traffic of vehicles are rather limited.
Car traffic is particularly significant in Slovenia, while Romania and Hungary both manage large numbers of lorries at their borders.
This is important, as lorry traffic is known to
have a disproportionately negative effect on
crossing times.
It is difficult to analyse this indicator because
some Member States do not report any detections. Thus, the low number points to difficulties in reporting rather than to the low
use of this modus operandi along the external EU borders.
Detections of illegal border-crossing at (rather
than between) BCPs are restricted to the external land and sea borders of the EU and to
detections that are confirmed clandestine
entries (e.g. hiding in means of transport).
Their volume is extremely low for the whole
of the EU, with 599 detections in 2013, especially compared with other indicators, such
as detections of illegal border-crossing between BCPs (107 360).
Clandestine entry requires migrants to stay
in confinement for long periods of time, and

is known to put migrants’ lives at risk of suffocation and dehydration. Therefore, most
of the migrants detected hiding in vehicles
at BCPs are single young males, rather than
more vulnerable family groups.
According to information provided by Western Balkan countries and several EU Member
States, there is considerable variation in the
modus operandi considering the points of departure (either straight from Greece or in several legs through the Western Balkans) and
types of vehicles used (cars, buses, cargo/passenger trains). In some reported cases irregular migrants were hidden in railway carriages
of international trains departing from Greece.
In view of the very low number of detections
reported at the external borders compared to
the large volume of vehicle (particularly lorry)
crossings, it is reasonable to assume that detections underestimate the actual number of
clandestine entries. While checking all vehicles would introduce undue waiting time for
many bona fide travellers, targeted checks
on some vehicles meeting specific risk criteria would make it possible to determine with
more precision the extent of the phenomenon and better prevent it. Operational risk
analysis techniques, similar to those used by
customs or for checking lorries at the border
between Schengen Member States and the
UK, could be adapted to the specificities of
the external borders.

3.2.3. Cross-border crime

Smuggling of illicit drugs

Frontex promotes and coordinates European
border management with a special focus on
migration flows. In application of the concept
of Integrated Border Management, it additionally supports Member States in combating organised crime at the external borders,
including the smuggling of goods and trafficking in human beings.

Cannabis from North Africa and the Western
Balkans

However, due to the legal and institutional
national characteristics, border guard authorities along the external borders of the EU have
different types and degrees of responsibilities in the fight against transnational crimes.
The nature and extent of inter-agency cooperation at the external borders thus differs greatly between EU Member States.
Regarding the prevention of smuggling of
illicit goods, border-control authorities of
one Member State play only an assisting
role, while border-control authorities in another Member State share their tasks with
Customs or are able conduct their own investigations. Because of these differences,
cross-border crime data reported by some
national border guard institutions are partial and sometimes do not include data collected by customs.
On the other hand, identifying cross-border movements of persons involved in criminal activities or victims thereof is a crucial
task of border-control authorities. Either in
the case of human trafficking or the travel
of voluntary fighters with a jihadist background, border agencies are confronted with
new challenges particularly in the field of
international and inter-agency cooperation, profiling, identification, and assistance
to victims.

The EU is destination for several main routes
for various narcotic drugs, coming from different regions of the world. According to the
EMCDDA/Europol EU Drug Markets Report*,
cannabis resin had been the most seized drug
in Europe for many years. The main provider
of cannabis resin to Europe is Morocco, although its production capacities are in decline
while those in Afghanistan are re-emerging. Amounts seized in Spain, the country
reporting the largest detections, exceeded
the domestic demand by around 15%. Large
amounts of cannabis resin are then forwarded
to the Netherlands and particularly Belgium.
In 2010, seizures of herbal cannabis exceeded
resin seizures for the first time in Europe. The
shift towards herbal cannabis was predominantly caused by an increase of domestic
production in many European countries. This
means that trafficking across the EU external borders has decreased, with the domestic production increasingly satisfying national
demand. An exception seems to be trafficking activities in southeast Europe, where
mainly Albanian cannabis supplies customer
demands of countries including Greece, Italy,
Slovenia, and Hungary.
By August 2013, the Italian Guardia di Finanza
concluded a major aerial surveillance operation to determine the amount of cannabis
which is produced by Albanian criminals. After an examination of 12.5% of the Albanian
territory, experts could identify the existence
of 500 plantations, which according to Italian
estimates produce an annual 1 000 tonnes of
herbal cannabis worth around EUR 4.5 billion. More than 300 hectares were identified
around the Albanian town of Lazarat near
the Greek border, which is essentially under
control of the local producers.

Cocaine from South America

Between 2001 and 2011, Spain accounted for
around 50% of all cocaine seizures in the EU.
Large shipments travelled by sea from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico,
Peru and Venezuela to Spain and Portugal.
A large share of the substance arrived from
South America via the African route. Since
2004, countries like Guinea, Guinea-Bissau,
the Gambia and Senegal have been developing into a region for transit and redistribution**, with absolute turnovers by the criminal
organisations often exceeding national security budgets of West African countries.
Drug traffickers preferred to transport the cocaine by aircraft, speedboats, maritime vessels and with couriers on commercial flights
to the EU, and tried to avoid the exposure of
risky overland transfers. Nevertheless, according to UNODC and various other public
sources, South American cocaine is going to
be increasingly transported across the Sahara
and North Africa to Europe, thereby affecting
stability in countries such as Mali and Libya.***
A diversification of trafficking routes away
from the very dominant routes to the Iberian
Peninsula drew a larger share of cocaine to
the ports of the Balkans and the Black Sea.
Between 2009 and 2011, four tonnes of cocaine have been seized in Bulgaria, Greece,
Romania and Turkey, accounting for 2% of
the overall number of seizures reported in
Europe.**** Although appearing comparably
low, the share of these four countries has
grown threefold since 2001. Moreover, the
EU Drug Markets Report 2013 published by

© Guardia di Finanza, 2013

According to EMCDDA/Europol calculations
based on seizure data*, cocaine shows to be
the third most intensively smuggled drug in
Europe after cannabis resin and herb. The seizure numbers increased between the midnineties and 2007, but have been declining
since 2009.

Seizure and treatment numbers suggest that
heroin use in Europe has been decreasing during the last decade, while consumers often
replaced the substance with other, mostly
synthetic drugs. However, seizures show that
heroin is still smuggled along the traditional
routes to the EU and remains a considerable source of income for internationally operating Organised Crime Groups. Most of the
heroin consumed in the EU is produced in Afghanistan and, to a lesser extent, in Iran and
Pakistan. It is transported along two major
routes to Europe: the Balkan route, which
runs through Turkey and the Balkan countries, and the Northern or Silk route, which
heads through Central Asia and the Russian
Federation.

Asia and Europe. Between 2001 and 2009,
seizures in Turkey increased three to fourfold
to 16 tonnes annually, contrasting the steady
decline that was registered in the rest of Europe, where only half of this amount could
be seized in 2009. In the years 2010 and 2011,
however, numbers of incidents and quantities of heroin seized appeared to be in steady
decline, both in the EU and Turkey.

The challenges for law-enforcement authorities at air and other external borders of the
EU lie within the development of widely established capacities to identify a diversity of
quickly emerging trends. Drug control legislative measures within the EU also need a
more coherent approach to prevent the exploitation of differences and gaps between
national jurisdictions.

From Turkey, smuggled heroin usually enters
the EU through the land borders of Greece
and Bulgaria. In a particularly significant incident on 1 August 2013, Turkish border authorities detected 717 kg of heroin at the
BCP Hamzabeyli on a Croatian-registered
lorry driven by a Croatian citizen. The officers found the 1 400 packages of heroin worth
around EUR 13.5 million between dishwashers,
washing machines, and LCD TVs. The lorry
that was loaded in Istanbul was on the way
to Bosnia and Herzegovina for a layover before further continuing its journey to the EU.
Similar but smaller seizures were also made in
Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Kosovo* and Serbia.

Trafficking in human beings (THB)

New psychoactive substances from China and
India
New psychoactive substances comprise a
wide range of drugs that are not yet under
control of national or international drug legislation. In 2012, the Early Warning System of
the EMCDDA and Europol listed a total of 73
synthetic substances. Although new psychoactive substances represent only a small share
of the illicit drugs market, they are particularly
dangerous because limited information about
their effects on the human body is available.
These substances often come in the form of
more openly sold ‘Legal Highs’, thereby giving
the false impression of legality and lower consumer exposure to physical and mental health
risks. They are believed to be largely used by
producers as replacements for more traditional drugs in short supply, as has been the
case with MDMA, better known as Ecstasy.

The detection of persons trafficked for sexual exploitation, forced labour or other purposes represents a major challenge for border
authorities, as victims themselves are often
not aware about their fate when they arrive
in the transit or destination countries. Border agencies in the EU and in third countries developed measures in various fields
to achieve better results in the detection of
incoming victims:
n At air borders, some EU authorities widened the time window for identification
of potential cases of THB by monitoring
areas between the boarding gate and the
airport arrival area. Moreover, flight crews
were trained to identify potential victims
and traffickers already in the plane.
n Some authorities took stronger measures to investigate the circumstances of
the travel of unaccompanied children.
n Measures were improved to identify fraudulent travel and supporting documents.
n An example from a third country is the
development of a proactive screening programme at Taiwanese airports,
which encourages immigrant workers to
complete an online questionnaire on the
circumstances of their employment. Immediate assistance is offered when certain indicators become visible.
As of February 2014, 20 countries have notified of a full transposition of the Directive
2011 / 36 / EU of the European Parliament and
of the Council of 5 April 2011 on preventing

and combating trafficking in human beings
and protecting its victims. The Directive defines the minimum common rules for identifying and sanctioning offences of trafficking
in human beings.
In 2013, Eurostat presented its first report
and statistics on THB at the EU level, including data on the years 2008 to 2010. Within
three years, the number of identified victims,
male and female, registered by police, NGOs
and other agencies in the EU Member States
increased from 3 691 (2008) to 4 198 (2009)
and 5 535 (2010).* As Eurostat points out, more
reported cases are not necessarily related to
a higher number of actual victims. The upward tendency may also be caused by an improved reporting rate of the phenomenon.
Data disaggregated by types of exploitation
during the three reference years show that
a majority of 62% of the victims were trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation
and 25% for labour exploitation. Others were
trafficked for forced begging, criminal activities, removal of organs and other purposes.
Important for border guards at the external
borders is the fact that the share of victims
from non-EU countries increased from 12% to
37% for male and from 18% to 39% for female
victims between 2008 and 2010.
According to Eurostat, the main third countries of origin in 2010 were Nigeria, China,
Paraguay, the Dominican Republic, Colombia, the Russian Federation, Brazil, Vietnam,
Namibia and Algeria. Two patterns are visible within the three reference years. First,
the number of victims from Latin America increased strongly while the number
of victims from the EU’s immediate neighbourhood decreased. This shift indicates an
increased use of air borders as entry gates for
trafficking to the EU. Second, victims from
Nigeria and China are consistently strongly
represented throughout the reference period and beyond, thus adding to the nec-

essary experience for the establishment of
more detailed profiles.
European foreign fighters in Syria
According to law-enforcement authorities
and experts, the number of Europeans with a
jihadist agenda fighting in the conflict in Syria
has significantly increased during 2013. According to an estimate made by the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation
in December**, between 396 and 1 937 fighters from Western Europe are presently taking part in the Syrian armed conflict. Since
the previous estimate of April 2013, the numbers, which are based on Member State estimates and open sources, have risen threefold.
Official figures from France and Denmark on
that phenomenon have tripled and authorities in Belgium, Germany and the UK have
even quadrupled their numbers. In January
2014, the French government stated that
around a dozen of the French nationals in
Syria or willing to go there are minors, being as young as 15 years of age.

** ICSR Insight: Up to

* It should be noted that
2008 data come from
22 EU Member States,
whereas 2009 and 2010
data include figures from
25 EU countries.

In light of this development, national governments and EU representatives are increasingly discussing ways to monitor and prevent
the movements of young people to Syria. Terrorism experts and law-enforcement officials
fear that some of these fighters may return
to Europe ideologically and militarily trained,
thus posing a terrorist threat to societies.
Smuggling of weapons
In a scheme revealed in December 2013,
French police has disrupted a particularly
large smuggling ring that trafficked several
hundreds of guns, pistols, Kalashnikovs, ammunition and spare parts mainly from the
Western Balkans to France.
According to media reports published in November 2013, the Hellenic Coast Guard intercepted a cargo ship near the Aegean island

45 of 80

Frontex · annual risk analysis 2014

of Symi with 20 000 AK-47 assault rifles and
explosives onboard. The crew of three Turkish and three Indian nationals was arrested.
The North Africa and Middle East representative for the United Nations Office for Drugs
and Crime recently warned that the instability and armed conflict in the Middle East
led to massive arms smuggling in the region.
Exit of stolen motor vehicles
According to Eurostat, the total number of
vehicles including cars, motorcycles, buses,
lorries, construction and agricultural vehicles stolen in the EU has been steadily falling from 1.85 million in 1998 to 0.88 million in
2010. Among the reasons were the advanced
technical protection measures developed by
the producers and intensified international
law-enforcement cooperation.
Only a small share of the vehicles stolen in
the EU is detected at its external borders,
often in the context of Frontex Joint Operations. In contrast to the overall theft statistics, detections at the borders reported to
Frontex showed a slight increase from 498
in 2012 to 519 in 2013. The increase may have
been caused by increased awareness and
relevant expertise of Frontex Guest Officers
and regular border guards.

Most car thefts were detected by querying
SIS II, the Interpol and national theft data
with the Vehicle Identification Numbers (VIN)
specified on the engine, frame and major
parts of most motor vehicles. Car thieves
applied various modi operandi to cloud the
identity of their stolen vehicles at the external borders. Reports indicated frequent manipulation of the VIN, or departure from the
EU with rental or very recently stolen cars
before authorities are notified of the theft.
In other cases, vehicles were disassembled
into parts to obscure identification or powers of attorney containing an authorisation
to travel abroad were counterfeited.

Modi operandi as mentioned above were regularly reported at the EU eastern borders,
where detections of stolen motor vehicles
on exit increased from 289 in 2012 to 313 in
2013. The vehicle brand preferences did not
change during the last years, as almost 40%
of the cars detected were produced by Volkswagen, Mercedes Benz and BMW. A majority
of the persons driving the stolen vehicles had
the nationality of the country to which they
intended to leave the EU. For example, 131 of
the 192 persons attempting to transfer their
stolen vehicle to Ukraine were of Ukrainian
nationality, only 35 were EU citizens.
Smuggling of excise goods
Tobacco
According to estimates of the European AntiFraud Office (OLAF), the smuggling and domestic illicit production of cigarettes caused
an annual financial damage of over EUR 10
billion in the budgets of the EU and its Member States. In effect of the financial and euro
crisis of the last years, many governments increased the taxes on excise goods to reduce
their budget deficits. Between July 2012 and
2013, at least ten EU Member States increased
their duties on cigarettes, in average by EUR
0.33 per pack of the ‘Most popular price category’, as defined by the European Commission.*
Currently, a customer would pay for an average pack of cigarettes EUR 5 in Finland,
whereas across the Russian border, the same
good would cost him only around EUR 1.5.
Not only individual consumers and small scale
smugglers from economically weak border
regions try to make use of existing price differences. Large scale criminal businesses illicitly import cigarettes from as far away as
Asia to Western European markets.
In June 2013, the European Commission presented a new strategy to step up fight against
illicit tobacco trade, which stipulates the in-

volvement of producers and countries of origin and the improvement of international and
inter-agency cooperation. It moreover provides strengthened sanctions and harmonised definitions of customs infringements.
In order to address the problem of contraband cigarettes and to prevent the oversupply of third-country markets, the EU has
already signed legally binding agreements

with the four largest tobacco manufacturers, which cover 80% of the world market.
Through these agreements the companies
committed themselves to sell to legitimate
clients only and to implement a tracking system that assists law-enforcement authorities in determining if cigarettes are traded
illegally. The smuggling of the main brands
produced by these four large companies has
decreased substantially over the past years.

47 of 80

Frontex · annual risk analysis 2014

However, smaller companies outside the EU
still sell large quantities to third-country markets where only an insignificant share of these
cigarettes can be absorbed by the local demand. Much of the rest is then smuggled
out to EU countries. In particular seizures
of ‘cheap white brands’ have been showing a strong upward tendency over the past
years. An example is the Jin Ling cigarette
brand produced in Kaliningrad, which grew
so popular among western consumers that
this brand itself became being counterfeited.
Although cigarette prices were recently also
increased in the eastern neighbourhood of
the EU, the smuggling of cigarettes from
Belarus, Moldova, the Russian Federation,
and Ukraine remained highly profitable and
fuelled the growth of transnational organised
crime groups active in that business.
Petroleum products
The contraband of fuel was mainly reported
at the eastern European borders with Belarus, the Russian Federation, Ukraine, and the
Western Balkan countries. This illegal activity
was caused by the price difference between
EU Member States and their third-country
neighbours. In many cases, the smugglers
crossed the border several times a week to
fill up the large or illegally extended petrol tanks of their private vehicles. This kind
of ant smuggling did not only cause fiscal
losses, but also increased the workload of
border guards significantly. Large shares of
the border queues at the eastern European
borders were regularly caused by fuel smugglers. Member States such as Estonia, Poland
and Slovakia are currently taking measures to
prevent individuals from crossing the borders
on a regular basis to import fuel for other than
private use. Travellers arriving in Estonia by
motor vehicle, for example, may now bring
fuel exempt from excise duty in the quantity
of one regular fuel tank only at the first entry within a calendar month.

3.3. After the border
3.3.1. Asylum applications
Analysing trends in asylum applications is
important for border-control authorities
because they are often the first authorities
prospective applicants meet, before being
referred to asylum authorities. For bordercontrol authorities, they thus represent an
important workload. Border-control authorities also play a role in the implementation of
the Dublin system. As mentioned in recital 3
of the Eurodac Regulation (and in recital 4 of
the recast Eurodac Regulation), for the purposes of applying the Dublin Regulation, it is
necessary to establish the identity of applicants for asylum and of persons apprehended
in connection with the unlawful crossing of
the external borders. Finally, unfounded applications for international protection inevitably delay the examination and subsequent
provision of protection for those third-country nationals with genuine claims. When applications are made further to an attempt to
illegally enter the territory (illegal bordercrossing, document fraud, refusal of entry,
clandestine entry), it overloads border-control
authorities and dilutes allocated resources.
In line with EU Regulation (EC) 862 / 2007,
complete data on asylum applications for
2013 are due at the end of February 2014 and
are usually available from Eurostat at the beginning of March 2014. The following analysis
is based on FRAN data, which are preliminary data made available by border-control
authorities and for France and the Netherlands only they include applications made at
the border.
The number of asylum claims submitted to
the FRAN increased very significantly. In 2013
the number of applications rose to a record
high since the FRAN was established in 2008,
at 353 991 applications following the previous record year of 2012 (276 308 applications).

The main countries of citizenship were Syria,
the Russian Federation and Afghanistan,
while applications from citizens of Western
Balkan countries continued to be significant
despite being overwhelmingly judged to be
unfounded by Member States.
Syrians were by far the most common nationality to request international protection
with 50 096 applications. This is nearly twice
as much as the already very high number of
applications submitted by Syrians in 2012 and
represented a significant increase in numbers
for the EU, but remained a tiny proportion of
the overall number of asylum seekers which,
according to UNHCR surpassed 2.3 million todate (February 2014). In the EU, more than twothirds of all Syrian applications were submitted
in Sweden (16 125), Germany (12 402) and Bulgaria (4 511). By contrast, very few applied for
asylum were submitted in Greece which, like
Bulgaria, neighbours Turkey from where many
Syrians arrived in the EU. Indeed, although
Greece allows Syrians to stay in the country for
six months, many do not consider applying for
asylum there because they receive little support
and prefer to apply in other Member States.
While many Syrians crossed illegally the external border before applying for asylum, the
total number of asylum applications of Syrians was twice as high as the number of detections of illegal border-crossing (25 546).
This difference may be linked to a combination of factors, including possibly significant
numbers of Syrians who:
n crossed the border illegally and have not
been detected;
n had been already legally or illegally staying in the EU and who claimed asylum as
it became clear that the prospect of return to Syria was impossible;
n entered the EU with valid travel documents and applied for asylum (e.g. people who obtained a visa for the purpose
of family reunification and applied for asylum once in the country).

Legitimacy of asylum claims
There is no legal definition of a ‘legitimate’ or ‘illegitimate’
claim at this stage. However, the recast Asylum Procedures
Directive includes the concepts of inadmissible / admissibleunfounded / admissible-manifestly unfounded applications,
which may be the basis for a future classification. Until Member States transpose the recast Asylum Procedures Directive
into their national legislation and an appropriate reporting is put in place, it will be difficult to address the question of international protection claim legitimacy.

A few Member States also allowed entry and
residence to Syrians through other channels.
On the basis of a temporary humanitarian admission programme (temporäres humanitäres
Aufnahmeprogramm) of 30 May 2013, Germany
selected, jointly with UNHCR, about 5 000
Syrian refugees in Lebanon. The extension of
this programme of 23 December 2013 includes
further 5 000 Syrians from Syria, the neighbouring countries (Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and
Turkey) and Egypt. Persons qualified for the
programme receive a preliminary residence
permit for two years. They are supposed to
travel on their own and are then distributed
among German federal states. Those with a
criminal record in Germany or any connections to criminal or terrorist organisations
are excluded from this programme.
In the first half of 2013, Hungary reported a
large increase in asylum applications, from
1 854 in the second semester of 2012 to 12 185
in the first semester of 2013, one of the most
spectacular increases recorded in the FRAN.
This increase was due to the January 2013
change in legislation in the Hungary asylum
policy to bring it in line with EU standards. The
news of this change quickly spread among
migrants from Kosovo* (many of whom are
able to transit Serbia easily, having passports or other official documentation) creating a pull factor that resulted in an increase

maining at a steady level of 25 802 in 2012 and
25 600 in 2013). In 2013, they went mostly to
Germany (16 092). With regard to this flow,
concerned Member States undertook measures intended to reduce or mitigate both push
factors in the countries of origin and pull factors in destination countries.

Much of the increase between 2012 and 2013
was also due to more asylum applications
submitted by citizens of the Russian Federation of Chechen origin in Poland and then
again in Germany. Most of these applications
are most likely of the same individuals who
first applied in Poland and then in Germany.

According to an ad hoc report produced by
EASO on this flow **, specific measures concerning pull factors included prioritisation of
asylum applications from the relevant countries of origin, engaging additional staff (or
staff normally in charge of other tasks) to
manage specific caseloads, shortening of
processing times, applying accelerated procedures, reduction or change in format of
benefits provided during the process (in
particular by reducing cash benefits) and
strengthened voluntary or forced return programmes. Lists of safe countries of origin remain an important tool in managing certain
caseloads, whereby applications submitted
by applicants from such a country of origin
are typically being processed in an accelerated manner, for Member States who use
those types of procedures.

In Bulgaria, the number of asylum applications also rose sharply, although from a low
base. Bulgaria reported 7 144 asylum applications in 2013 which is a massive increase
compared to a year previously (1 376). The increase was mostly due to Syrians whose applications accounted for nearly two-thirds of
all applications in Bulgaria for the year. Syrians mostly travelled in family units. There
is some evidence that many had already received protection in Turkey, but Bulgaria
offers comparatively cheaper living conditions while being relatively close to Syria.
The Bulgarian reception system was quickly
overloaded and Bulgaria is still opening new
centres and trying to improve conditions in
the reception centres.
Syrians who had crossed the border illegally
to Italy and Greece instead did not generally
apply for asylum there but continued on to
other EU Member States.
Western Balkan nationals, mostly from Serbia,
continued to apply in large number for asylum. Considering together the five Western
Balkan countries with visa-free regime (Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Albania and the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia), they represent the largest proportion of asylum applicants in the EU (re-

50 of 80

Measures concerning push factors included
high level visits and initiatives to develop migration partnership aiming at a more comprehensive approach to migration; local visits
and information campaigns aimed at clarifying the misconceptions of potential applicants
regarding the intended destination country.
EASO highlighted in its report that the combination of short processing time and lowered
cash benefits seemed to bring most change
in terms of lowering the number of applications filed in a Member States.
The topic of multiple applications in various
Member States falls directly under the Dublin procedures and related statistics collected
by Eurostat. Unfortunately, statistics are not
very informative since they are not disag-

gregated by citizenship. The lack of cohort
statistics on international protection also
means that decision figures and asylum applications cannot be compared. Indeed, the
delay for examining a claim and issuing a de-

cision are significant and vary widely among
EU States. As a consequence, the decisions
issued throughout 2013 do not systematically
relate to claims lodged in 2013 and both indicators need to be interpreted with caution.

3.3.2. Detections of illegal stay
Through Frontex Risk Analysis Network
(FRAN), Member States also report on the
number of third-country nationals who have
been detected by Member State authorities
while not fulfilling, or no longer fulfilling, the
conditions for stay or residence, whether they
were detected inland or while trying to exit
the territory.
The number of detections of illegal stay includes third-country nationals who are not in
the possession of a valid visa, residence permit, travel document etc., or being in breach
of a decision to leave the country. It also includes third-country nationals who initially
entered legally but overstayed their permission to stay.
In 2013, there were 344 888 detections of illegal stay in the EU, which represents a generally stable trend compared to the year before
and the recent reporting periods. This is consistent with a stable but slightly declining
long-term trend over the past five years. In
2008, there were 441 237 detections of illegal stay, or 28% more than in 2013.
In the following analysis of detections of illegal stay, it has to be kept in mind that the
Netherlands, for 2012 and 2013, due to technical reasons, only reported detections on exit
and not detections made inland, which in 2011
amounted to about 6 000. Also in Sweden,
for administrative reasons, many asylum applicants were also reported as illegal stayers,
raising the total number of detections of illegal stay in Sweden. Finally, detections for
Croatia (1 397) corresponded to detections
between July and December 2013, after the
country joined the EU.
The overall stable trends masked large difference between Member States. Germany
continued to rank first and also reported the
highest absolute increase. Most of the in-

52 of 80

crease was due to increase in detections of
Russians and Syrians. The second largest increase in volume was reported by Bulgaria,
mostly of Syrians. This increase coincided
with an increase in detections of illegal border-crossing and asylum applications.
But several Member States also reported very
large decreases, notably Greece where detections dropped by 41% between 2012 and
2013. The decrease was also significant in
Italy, where detections dropped by 22% between 2012 and 2013.
The vast majority of illegal stayers were detected inland (290 978 detections, or 84% of
the total) and so are presumed to be longterm over stayers as they were making no attempt to leave at the time of detection. The
next most common location for detections
of illegal stayers was those exiting at the air
(30 883 detections or 9% of the total) followed
by the land borders (17 677 detections, or 5%)
whereby illegally staying migrants were leaving the EU or the Schengen area.
In terms of nationalities, the large number of
Syrians detected staying illegally is artificially
inflated by detections in Sweden which includes people not meeting requirements for
staying in Sweden before they apply for asylum. Looking at detections in the past few
years, Moroccans stand out as one the main
nationalities detected staying illegally (above
20 000 annual detections between 2009 and
2013), although their detections at the external borders remain much lower. This tends to
indicate that Moroccans tend to cross legally
the external borders, but then overstay their
legal period of stay within the EU. The same
applies to Algerians, although in lower number (above 10 000 annual detections for illegal stay between 2009 and 2013). Afghans also
stand out as among the top nationalities since
2009, but are showing a decreasing trend,
with 38 637 detections in 2009 and 16 836 detections in 2013. The decreasing trend in de-

tections for staying illegally coincides with a
decreasing trend in detections at the border, as
well as a decrease in applications for asylum.

3.3.3. Returns

160 000

In terms of data on return of third-country
nationals in third-countries, the first set refers to Member States decisions to return
third-country nationals and the second set
concerns effectively carried out returns. The
number of decisions to return has traditionally been much lower than that of effective
returns due to a number of factors, such as
the fact that a number of decisions in some
Member States are issued to persons who are
not staying legally but then apply for asylum,
and are thus not returned.
Data on returns focus on return to thirdcountries, and exclude readmissions of
third-country nationals carried out between
Member States.
Decisions to return
In 2013, there were 224 305 third-country nationals subject to an obligation to leave the EU
as a result of an administrative or judicial decision, which was a 17% decrease compared to
2012. The absolute total number of migrants
subject to return decisions is still underestimated by this indicator, as data on decisions
were unavailable from, inter alia, France and
the Netherlands, while Sweden, which is assumed to have issued high numbers of decisions, only reported effective returns.
Much of the change between 2012 and 2013
was due to a decrease in return decisions by
Greece (-49 % between 2012 and 2013). This
decrease is in line with decreases reported by
Greece in detections of illegal border-crossing
(-46%) and of illegally staying persons (-40%).
By contrast, return decisions significantly increased in the UK, which ranked first in 2013,
as well as in Austria.

Effective returns
In 2013, there was a steady trend of 160 699
third-country nationals effectively returned
to outside the EU. The UK was the Member
State conducting the highest number of returns, with steady trends of returned Indians
and Pakistanis. Greece reported an increase
in effective returns, mostly of Albanians following their increased detections for illegal border-crossing in 2013. Effective returns
nearly doubled in Bulgaria, in the wake of the
increased detections of illegal border-crossing at the land border with Turkey.
Type of effective return
It is difficult to evaluate the overall cost-effectiveness of return measures in comparison with other practical measures taken to
reduce irregular migration. However, forced
returns are recognised as being more costly
than voluntary returns, although Member
States highlight the importance of return
flights (including those co-ordinated by Frontex) in ensuring an effective return, as well
as having a deterrent effect for future irregular migrants.*

Within the number of effective returns to
third countries, 40% were reported to be on
a voluntary basis and 54% were forced returns. The UK and Poland reported the largest number of voluntary returns, and Greece,
the UK and France accounted for nearly half
of the forced returns. As in 2012, most of the
forced returns in 2013 concerned Albanians
returned by Greece, followed by Pakistanis.
3.3.4. Detections of facilitators
Overall detections of facilitators fell by 10%
between 2012 and 2013, from 7 720 to 6 902.
This decrease is consistent with a more general long-term decreasing trend in detections of facilitators of irregular migration. In
2008 and 2009, there were more than 9 000
such detections.
According to some reports, this long-term decline may in part be due to a widespread shift
towards the abuse of legal channels and document fraud to gain entry to the EU, which
results in facilitators being able to operate
remotely and inconspicuously rather than
accompanying migrants during high-risk activities such as border-crossing.

54 of 80

Member States tend to detect more domestic facilitators than any other nationality; in
2013, all of the top three reporting countries
for this indicator reported their own citizens
as facilitators more frequently than any other
single nationality. Among the countries reporting the most facilitators this propensity was strongest in Italy and Spain, where
about a third of all detected facilitators were
of their own nationality. In France, domestic facilitators accounted for about a fifth of
all detections.
Facilitation of illegal immigration consists
of three aspects or sub-phenomena: (1) facilitation of irregular migrants’ entry to the
EU via the EU external borders; (2) facilitation of irregular migrants’ secondary movements within the EU (within the Schengen
area or between Schengen and the EU); and
(3) facilitation of migration status transition
of irregular migrants within the EU, i.e. the
legalisation of their residence status. Organised crime groups can be involved in any of
the three areas.

4. Environmental scan
1. European Commission’s
priorities in 2014

to facilitate a more harmonised approach
and to improve identification.

a) F
 ight against trafficking in human
beings

 he first evaluation report of the EU StratT
egy towards the Eradication of Trafficking in Human Beings will be published by
the European Commission in mid-2014.

In the context of the implementation of the
EU Strategy towards the Eradication of Trafficking in Human Beings and the implementation of the Joint Statement of the Head of
the EU Justice and Home Affairs agencies,
the European Commission reflects on the
following issues regarding trafficking in human beings:
n E
 arly identification of victims is of primary importance in the EU legal and political framework. In September 2013, the
European Commission published a Reference Document on Guidelines on the Identification of Victims of Trafficking in Human Beings
addressed especially to border guards and
consular services. This Reference Document was based on Frontex Anti-trafficking
Training for Border Guards – Trainer’s Manual
and the Handbook for Diplomatic and Consular Personnel on how to Assist and Protect Victims of Human Trafficking (produced by the
Council of the Baltic Sea States – CBSS).
n T
 he European Commission has also funded
a project that will develop guidelines for
better identification of victims, taking into
account the EC/ILO 2009 lists of indicators
on trafficking of human beings, in order

b) I mproving the knowledge regarding
irregular secondary movements of
third-country nationals within the EU
The Council has identified strategic priority
areas where efforts need to be stepped up
and monitored in relation to irregular immigration. Under one of those strategic priority
areas, a number of goals are listed, including
‘Strengthening identification of illegal immigration routes inside the Schengen area’.
Member States generally agree that there is
a need for better data collection and analysis, that the Commission should play a role
in this and that existing structures should be
used to the greatest extent possible.
Three groups of third-country nationals involved in secondary movements within the
Schengen area could be distinguished: (a) migrants who have entered illegally; (b) migrants who have entered legally but are no
longer entitled to stay in the Schengen area
(overstayers); and (c) asylum seekers (who
have moved to another Member State from
the one where they have initially submitted
their application).

55 of 80

Frontex · annual risk analysis 2014

Following more than a year of preparatory
work, the Frontex Risk Analysis Network
agreed in December 2013 on indicators of
these movements to be regularly collected
as of January 2014. The knowledge gathered
through the regular data collection and the
analytical follow up, should feed into the assessment of the functioning of the Schengen
area and to the strategic level discussion on
possible measures aimed at countering unauthorised secondary movements of thirdcountry nationals within the EU.

The following tentative dates have so far been
agreed for the roll-out in 2014:
n 15 May 2014: Central America, North
America, the Caribbean, Australasia
n 25 September 2014: Western Balkans and
Turkey, the Eastern neighbouring countries

2. Implementation of
Objective 4 of the Internal
Security Strategy

State of play of entry / exit system and
registered traveller programme

a) T
 he second generation of the
Schengen Information System (SIS II)
The focus for the Commission in 2014 / 2015
will be to monitor correct implementation
by Member States of all SIS II functionalities
(new data categories, linking between alert,
European Arrest Warrant (EAW), photographs). Also, the European Commission will
present a report on the use of fingerprints in
SIS II in accordance with Article 22(c) of the
legal basis. Finally, the Commission will follow up the integration of possible new Member States and Europol.
b) T
 he roll-out and impact of Visa
Information System (VIS)
The VIS will be rolled out, region by region,
until all Schengen states’ consulates worldwide are connected. The global roll-out will
take at least until spring 2015. So far, the VIS
has started operations in North Africa in
October 2011, in the Near East in May 2012,
in the Gulf region, in October 2012, in West
and Central Africa in March 2013, in East and
Southern Africa in June 2013, in South America
in September 2013 and in Central and South
East Asia and in the occupied Palestinian Territory in November 2013.

56 of 80

However a few Member States consider they
might need more time for the roll-out in
countries such as Ukraine and Belarus. The
roll-out for the remaining regions will not
take place before 2015.

The Smart Borders Package will re-examine and test both a detailed design of the
technical architecture and the underlying
operational processes. Its objective will be
to ensure that the best possible choices are
made both from a technical and cost-benefit
point of view, taking into account the need
for a high level of data protection.
c) EUROSUR Regulation
On 2 December 2013 the European Border
Surveillance System (EUROSUR) became operational. EUROSUR will be operational in 30
countries in total. In this first phase, it will become operational in 19 countries, the 18 EU
Member States at the southern and eastern external borders and the Schengen Associated Country Norway. As of 1 December
2014, another eight EU Member States and
three Schengen Associated Countries will join
EUROSUR. Ireland and the UK do not take
part in the Schengen cooperation and therefore also not involved in EUROSUR.
The backbone of EUROSUR is formed by ‘national coordination centres’, via which all national authorities with a responsibility for
border surveillance (e.g. border guard, police, coast guard, navy) are required to cooperate and to coordinate their activities.

Information on incidents occurring at the external land and sea borders, the status and
position of patrols as well as analytical reports and intelligence are being shared via
‘national situational pictures’ among these
national authorities.
This cooperation and information exchange
allows the concerned Member State to react much faster to any incidents concerning
irregular migration and cross-border crime
or relating to a risk to the lives of migrants.
Frontex plays an important role in bringing
together and analysing in the ‘European situational picture’ information collected by
Member States, thereby detecting changing
routes or new methods used by criminal networks. This European situational picture also
contains information collected during Frontex
joint operations and on the pre-frontier area.
Furthermore, Frontex cooperates with other
EU agencies, such as the European Maritime
Safety Agency and the EU Satellite Centre.

3. The new Internal Security
Fund and financing in the
area of Home Affairs for the
period 2014–2020
The final text of the ISF Borders was agreed
between the three institutions in December 2013. Despite important cuts in the initial
budget, the main features of this instrument
proposed by the Commission have remained
in the final text. The global resources for
the implementation between 2014 and 2020
(seven years) will be EUR 2 760 million, of
which 1 551 shall be allocated to the Member States. The main features of the funds
are described below:
n s upport and reinforce the national capabilities in the area of border control and
visa policy and thus expressing financial
solidarity with the tasks entrusted to individual Member States at external bor-

ders and in consulates in the interest of
the border-free area as a public service
provided to the Union;
n fi
 nance the development of the smart border package, i.e. the setting up of an EU
Entry / Exit System (EES) and an EU Registered Traveller Programme (RTP);
n fi
 nance the introduction and operation of
the European Border Surveillance System,
EUROSUR, notably through the purchase
of equipment, infrastructure and systems
in Member States;
n r einforce the Schengen governance and
the evaluation and monitoring mechanism
to verify the application of the Schengen
acquis by (a) funding the operation of that
mechanism under direct management;
(b) introducing conditionalities based on
compliance with the Schengen acquis
for the disbursement of operating support to Member States and (c) requiring
Member States to (re)allocate resources
received for programmes under this instrument with priority to remedy weaknesses if these have been identified under
the mechanism;
n b
 oost the operational potential of the
Frontex Agency by inviting Member States
to earmark additional resources under
their programmes for specialised equipment which can be put at the disposal of
the Agency for its Joint Operations;
n s upport the development and implementation of the relevant Union policies in
the EU, in and with third countries under
‘Union actions’, thus improving the overall management of migration flows to the
Union (projects managed either directly,
such as studies or pilot projects to reinforce co-operation with third countries,
or indirectly, in accordance with the Financial Regulation);

n h
 ave readily available adequate resources
to provide emergency assistance in case
of situations of urgent or exceptional migratory pressure;
n c
 ontinue support for the functioning of
the Specific Transit Scheme for Lithuania, in accordance with the obligations
of the EU, providing support to compensate for foregone fees from transit visas
and additional costs incurred by Lithuania in implementing the Facilitated Transit Document (FTD) and Facilitated Rail
Transit Document (FRTD) scheme, such
as replacing and upgrading equipment, IT
systems, training and operational costs.

4. T
 he Schengen Governance
legislative package
Already in mid-September 2011, the Commission presented a communication entitled ‘Schengen Governance – strengthening
the area without internal border control’. The
package contained two legislative proposals, a
regulation on the establishment of an evalua-

Procedure for reintroducing border control
at internal borders
[Member] States which want to reinstate border control must
provide details of the situation to the Commission and its partners and, if required, convince them of the necessity of such
measures through joint meetings. This ‘explanation process’
carries three major consequences. Firstly, the new measures
strongly restrict Member States’ discretionary powers. Or,
from a different angle, the Member States’ ‘safeguard clause’
is subject to a powerful instance of ‘communitisation’. Further,
the amendment gives the Commission and the Member States
the opportunity to appeal to the Court of Justice when, for
instance, a state reintroduces border control without having
convinced its partners of the necessity and proportionality.

tion and monitoring mechanism to verify the
application of the Schengen acquis (10597/13)
and one an amendment to the Schengen Borders Code as regards the rules for the temporary reintroduction of border controls at
internal borders in exceptional circumstances
(PE-CO S 30/13). The package that aims to be
the EU’s response to potential derogations
and restrictions to liberty of circulation was
finally adopted in October 2013.
a) Schengen evaluation mechanism
The revision of the Schengen evaluation
mechanism is quite extensive. Increased importance of the Commission and significantly
enhanced follow-up procedures regarding
how identified deficiencies in any Member
State should be remedied are two most striking changes.
Also, Schengen evaluations now cover all aspects of the Schengen acquis, including the
absence of border controls at internal borders
and can also be conducted as unannounced
on-site visits. Importantly, recommendations
from Frontex annual risk analysis will be taken
into account by the Commission when drafting annual evaluation programmes and deciding on unannounced on-site visits.
b) R
 eintroduction of border control
at internal borders
Schengen states reserve their severing right
to unilaterally reintroduce internal border
controls. The main novelties are linked to duration, geographic scope and procedure to be
followed when a Member State wishes to reintroduce internal border controls.
Namely, the amendments stipulate that reintroduction of border control is also possible for specific parts of internal border and
not just the entire border section in question. This solution reflects the reality of the
situation since border controls are often only

necessary at a certain section of the internal
border in question.
They also clarify the maximum duration for
which border control may be reintroduced,
whether it is for foreseeable events (up to
six months) or in an emergency (up to two
months). Importantly, an obligation for Member States to provide more specific reasoning
behind the reintroduction of internal borders is also a novelty worth mentioning (see
box for details).
Probably the most important change is linked
to specific measures in the case of serious
deficiencies relating to the external border
controls. Namely, if evaluation report under
the Schengen evaluation mechanism concludes that a Member State has been seriously neglecting its obligations, the Council
may on the basis of a Commission proposal
recommend that one or more specific Member States reintroduce border controls at all or
specific parts of the internal borders. In such
extreme case, the Council’s initiative (recommendation and not obligation) is considered
as a last resort.

5. S
 chengen visa policy
developments
In the first half of 2014 it is expected that
the visa-free regime will be applicable with
Moldova, after the country is transferred to
the visa-free list of Regulation 539 / 2001. If
the visa-free regime would lead to abuses,
then the new suspension mechanism could
be triggered.
An additional 19 countries (16 Pacific and Caribbean island nations, the United Arab Emirates, Peru and Colombia) will probably be
transferred to the visa-free list of Regulation
539/2001 in April 2014, but visa-free travel will
need to wait until the negotiation and entry
into force of visa waiver agreements with
each of these countries – which means prob-

ably until 2015 at least. Moreover, the negotiations for the visa waiver agreements with
Peru and Colombia will only start after the
Commission presents a positive assessment
of the risks involved, particularly in terms of
irregular migration and security. It is unlikely
that the move to grant visa-free status to the
16 Caribbean and Pacific island nations and
to the UAE will bring any additional risks in
terms of migration and security.
Towards the end of the year 2014, the Commission may propose a new revision of the
lists of countries of Regulation 539 /2001, using a new methodology that will take into
account not only the traditional security and
irregular immigration criteria but also economic and human rights considerations.
‘Touring visa’
In March 2014, the European Commission will
present a proposal recasting and amending
the Visa Code and a proposal to establish a
new ‘touring visa’, allowing to circulate in the
Schengen area for more than 90 days per 180
days without staying longer than 90 days in
one Schengen state. Due to upcoming European elections, this proposal will be adopted
by the co-legislators not before 2015.

6. Possible evocation of the socalled ‘Visa safeguard clause’
by Member States already in
2014
The visa suspension mechanism has been
available to Member States since 9 January 2014. Member States can now request
the Commission to temporarily suspend the
visa-free regime with a third country when
at least one of the criteria listed in Regulation 1289 / 2013 is met (see box).
The European Commission is aware of the
still worrying numbers of unfounded asylum
applications from citizens of some Western

in place in the Member States and improve
the asylum system efficiency.

7. Revised Dublin Regulation

The new regulation establishes more concrete
criteria and clarifies which Member State is
responsible for examining an application for
international protection.

On 29 June 2013, the EC Regulation 343/2003,
known as Dublin II, was recast. The new regulation, Regulation (EU) No 604/2013, known
as Dublin III, was jointly adopted by the European Parliament and the European Council.
This new regulation, applicable as of 1 January
2014, intends to harmonise practices already

Criteria from Regulation 1289 / 2013
Article 1a
A Member State may notify the Commission if it is confronted,
over a six-month period, in comparison with the same period
in the previous year or with the last six months prior to the implementation of the exemption from the visa requirement for
nationals of a third country listed in Annex II, with one or more
of the following circumstances leading to an emergency situation which it is unable to remedy on its own, namely a substantial and sudden increase in the number of:
(a) nationals of that third country found to be staying in the
Member State’s territory without a right thereto;
(b) asylum applications from the nationals of that third country for which the recognition rate is low, where such an
increase is leading to specific pressures on the Member
State’s asylum system;
(c) rejected readmission applications submitted by the Member State to that third country for its own nationals.
The comparison with the six-month period prior to the implementation of the exemption from the visa requirement as
referred to in the first subparagraph shall only be applicable
during a period of seven years from the date of implementation of the exemption from the visa requirement for nationals of that third country.

60 of 80

It also contains more provisions to protect the
applicants as a new right to information for
asylum applicants and the compulsory obligation to a personal interview. New clauses
concerning children’s rights and family reunification were also introduced, in order to
guarantee the minors best interests and better ensure family reunification.
There was also a strong emphasis concerning the fundamental rights covered by this
new regulation. In this regard, it contains a
new provision on judicial remedies for asylum seekers to challenge the Dublin decisions
where transfers would not be in compliance
with their fundamental rights and there was
the risk of inhuman or degrading treatment.
According to the European Commission, the
new regulation will have no or no significant
impacts on the distribution of the asylum applications. The principles of the system remain
the same in the recast, and, most importantly,
the main criteria for establishing the Member
State responsible remain unchanged.
According to UNHCR, the recast statutes,
which will require extensive transposition at
the national level in 2014, strengthen protection standards. However, discrepancies in implementation persist, leading to protection
gaps in some countries and posing challenges
to the functioning of the Common European
Asylum System. These include challenges in
the application of the Dublin III Regulation,
which determines which Member State is responsible for examining an asylum application.

Eurodac changes
Until recently the Eurodac database could
only be used for asylum purposes. However, the European Commission’s proposal
to recast the Eurodac Regulation (603 / 2013)
includes an extension to the scope of the
Regulation in order to allow law-enforcement authorities in Member States as well as
Europol to compare latent fingerprints from
crime scenes with Eurodac fingerprint data
for the purpose of preventing, detecting and
investigating serious crimes and terrorism.
According to the legislation there are several
restrictions to use the information stored in
the Eurodac system*:
n Limited searches only to the most serious
crimes, such as murder and terrorism;
n Law-enforcement authorities must undertake a comparison of fingerprints against
the Visa Information System (where
permitted);
n L aw-enforcement checks may not be
made in a systematic way, but only as a
last resort when all the conditions for access are fulfilled;
n No data received from Eurodac may be
shared with third countries.
Entry into force and impact on
distribution of asylum applications
The recast Eurodac Regulation will be applicable from 20 July 2015. According to the European Commission, it will have no impact on
the changes on distribution of asylum applications or secondary movements, but there is
a change concerning persons who have been
granted international protection. Until now, if
someone applies for asylum, it has not been
possible to check whether they were previously granted protection in another Member
State. From the mentioned date onwards, it
will be possible for a Member State to see if
the person already has a status elsewhere
and, if so, it should be possible to return that

person to the Member State that granted
protection.

8. EU Readmission Agreements
– state of play regarding new
agreements
According to the information provided by
the European Commission, the Readmission Agreement with Turkey was signed on
16 December 2013 and will enter into force
once the European Parliament gives its consent and the Turkish Parliament ratifies it.
A Readmission Agreement with Azerbaijan
was initialled in July 2013. Preparations for the
signature are being made, after which entry
into force is expected to follow without delay.
Negotiation of the Readmission Agreement
with Morocco is expected to be re-launched
soon. The parallel negotiation of a Visa Facilitation Agreement, as part of the EU-Morocco Mobility Partnership, should break the
current deadlock. A similar process is foreseen for Tunisia, although negotiating directives for a Readmission Agreement have
not yet been recommended to the Council.

* http://ec.europa.eu/
dgs/home-affairs/whatwe-do/policies/asylum/
identification-of-applicants/
index_en.htm

Readmission negotiations with Belarus were
officially launched on 29 January 2014, following an initial invitation to open negotiations
in 2011. A first round of technical negotiations is expected to be held in March 2014.
The course and length of negotiations is, according to the European Commission, difficult to predict, though the parallel negotiation
of Visa Facilitation Agreement is expected to
facilitate the process. For comparison, the
agreement with Armenia, which is the most
recent to enter into force, required a period
of around 20 months from the start of negotiations until entry into force.

Analysis of Eurodac ‘hits’ data for 2012
The Eurodac statistics are based on records of (1) fingerprints from all individuals aged
14 years or over who have made applications for asylum in the Member States (‘category 1’), (2) fingerprints of persons who were apprehended when crossing a Member State’s external border irregularly (‘category 2’), or (3) persons who were found
illegally present on the territory of a Member State (in case the competent authorities consider it necessary to check a potential prior asylum application) (‘category 3’).
In 2012, a total of 34.4% of all multiple applications were local hits* (down from
38.6% in 2011). In a number of Member States (Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech
Republic, Spain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, the UK) this figure even exceeds 50%. In the case of Belgium, local hits accounted for 10 037 of the
14 883 applications (67.4%) and in Cyprus local hits accounted for 139 of the 148 applications (93.9%).
Foreign hits** give an indication of the secondary movements of asylum seekers in
the EU. As in previous years, the statistics confirm that the secondary movements
witnessed do not necessarily follow the ‘logical’ routes between neighbouring Member States. For instance, France continued to receive the highest number of foreign
hits from asylum seekers who previously lodged an application in Poland (2 498).
Germany and Switzerland received a high number of asylum seekers who had previously lodged an application in Sweden (2 567 and 1 050, respectively). The statistics show, as in previous years, that foreign hits are not a one-way street from the
countries with an external land border or those bordering the Mediterranean to the
more northerly Member States.
When comparing 2012 with 2011 an increase from 21% to 65.3% can be observed in
the number of cases of persons apprehended in connection with an irregular border-crossing who later decide to lodge an asylum claim. This reflects an increase in
absolute terms from 7 384 in 2011 to 17 319 in 2012.
The majority of those who entered the EU illegally via Italy and moved on, travelled
to Switzerland (2 978), Germany (1 359) or Sweden (881). Those who moved on after
having entered illegally via Greece mainly went to Germany (2 168), Sweden (1 612)
or Austria (1 216). Of those entering via Spain, most moved on to either France (410),
Germany (284), Belgium (259) or Switzerland (242), while those who moved on after
having had their fingerprints taken in Hungary mainly moved on to the neighbouring countries of Germany (61) or Austria (59).
* ‘Local hits’ are cases where a person making an asylum application in a Member State is discovered to have
previously applied for asylum in the same Member State.
* ‘Foreign hits’ are cases where a person making an asylum application in a Member State is discovered to
have previously applied for asylum or detected for illegal border-crossing in another Member State.

5. Outlook
This chapter reviews the possible evolution
of the situation along the external border of
the EU in the coming years. While some developments are likely to materialise, others
seem possible, based on current knowledge.
Finally, past experiences demonstrate that
there are a large number of unforeseeable
events and factors that can have a profound
and unpredictable impact on the situation
at the border.

5.1. The likely
The best forecasts – those likely to materialise and have a direct bearing on the situation
at the external borders – are the continued
use of the Mediterranean area as the main
crossing points for irregular migration, and
the growing workload of border-control authorities due to growth of passengers flows
and the introduction in October 2014 of compulsory biometric check on VIS Schengen
visa holders. At the same time, border-control authorities are increasingly expected to
be engaged in search and rescue operations
covering vast areas of the Mediterranean
Sea, as well as being the first interlocutors
for a growing number of persons presenting themselves at the EU borders in search
of international protection. Budget environment is expected to remain tight over the
next few years.

5.1.1. I llegal border-crossing expected to
remain concentrated in southern
and south-eastern borders of the EU
Based on the location of the main countries
of origin for irregular migration to the EU for
the past five years, the border areas that are
most likely to deal with illegal border-crossing
remain the Southern Mediterranean coast,
and the borders with Turkey. Migrants living
in or having relatively easy /facilitated access
to Turkey and / or North Africa will continue
to be overrepresented in the flow of irregular migrants to the EU. In particular, departures of sub-Saharan migrants from Libya
across the Central Mediterranean to reach
Italy and arrivals of Syrians crossing the border illegally to apply for asylum in the EU –
two phenomena already present in 2013 – are
likely to continue in the near future.
Southern Mediterranean area
On the Eastern Mediterranean route, enhanced surveillance along the Greek land border with Turkey has resulted in a displacement
to the Eastern Aegean Sea and the Bulgarian
land border with Turkey. Displacement to the
Eastern Aegean Sea is expected to put pressure on the limited local reception facilities
for undocumented migrants and increase the
allocation of resources for search and rescue
operations, as well as increase the possibility of migrants continuing undetected their
journey to Western European Member States.

63 of 80

Frontex · annual risk analysis 2014

The Bulgarian authorities will carry on building and renovating reception facilities but
resources are being stretched and migrants
will continue to consider crossing illegally the
land border between Turkey and Greece as
an option to reach their final destinations in
the EU. Among those migrants, Syrians are
the most vulnerable and the likelihood of
humanitarian crisis at the EU border will remain significant until the situation in Syria improves. The ability to provide consistent and
timely measures and actions will be crucial for
coping with security and humanitarian risks.
In addition, an increasing number of migrants
from North Africa and the Middle East are expected to transit to Turkey via the air border,
before attempting to cross illegally the border to the EU, including through the use of
forged document. Istanbul airport (IST) is an
important hub for irregular migrants travelling by air route to several Member States,
with continuous increase in passenger flows
for the past few years and airline carriers’ expansion towards Africa and the Middle East.
Turkish airports are thus likely to remain common embarking points for irregular migrants
arriving in the EU.
Central Mediterranean area
In the Central Mediterranean, many areas on
the North African coasts may be used as departure points for illegal border-crossing to
the EU. At the end of 2013, departures from
Libya were increasing, but Egypt and Tunisia
also offer crossing options for potential migrants. North African countries may be used
as transit countries for migrants from more
southern African countries to sail across the
Mediterranean. They may be used as transit by migrants from many different origins,
which complicate further predictions in terms
of volume.
The increasing detections of illegal bordercrossing in the Central Mediterranean, along

64 of 80

with the increasing complexity of irregular
arrivals are expected to absorb a significant
proportion of resources. The broadening of
the surveillance area results in border assets being increasing mobilised in support
of search and rescues activities.
5.1.2. Increased workload at the border
Regular passenger flows across the external
border will increase significantly in the coming years due to rising global mobility. Visa
liberalisation processes and local border traffic agreements are placing also increasing responsibilities on border-control authorities.
Air travel environment is becoming more
complex with the growth of low-cost carriers.
Also the advances in travel complexity and
growing sophistication of criminal activities
generate increasing workloads for bordercontrol officers and difficulties in developing
risk assessments of planes and passengers.
In addition, the EU continues to receive a
high number of asylum seekers. A substantial number of economic migrants appear
to use the asylum procedure to try entering
or staying on the territory of the EU. Their
first interlocutors are often border-control
authorities.
5.1.3. V
 IS implemented at BCPs in
October 2014
The Visa Information System (VIS) is a system
for the exchange of information on short-stay
visas between Member States. The VIS was
established via Council Decision 2004/512/EC
of 8 June 2004. The main objectives of the
VIS are to facilitate visa application procedures and checks at the external borders and
to enhance security. The VIS facilitates the
exchange of data between Schengen states
on visa applications in order to ease procedures, prevent ‘visa shopping’ and assist in
the fight against fraud.

Figure 25. VIS was rolled-out in eleven regions in 2011–2013. The roll-out will continue with the remaining twelve
regions adopting VIS during 2014 and 2015, although no dates have yet been agreed on

The VIS became operational on 11 October
2011. The start of the VIS operations has had
major consequences for the EU’s border authorities. By the end of the transitional period,
three years after VIS began, i.e. in October
2014, all Schengen Member States will be required to be able to carry out VIS fingerprint
verifications at all BCPs and also be able to
issue VIS visas with biometrics at the border
when necessary.
The obligation for consulates to exchange visa
data follows a roll-out calendar established
for 23 regions of the world (see Fig. 25). At the
end of 2013, consulates in 11 regions were already using the VIS. Data on visas issued in
2013 is not yet available, but together these
11 regions represented 23% of all visas issued

in 2012. The roll-out will continue throughout
2014, but definite dates have not yet been determined by the Council. Member States are
still debating on the most practical way to
roll-out the VIS in regions representing the
bulk of short-term visa application and issuance, in particular the Russian Federation
(Region 18), alone representing 42% of all visas issued in 2012.
The VIS Regulation (Article 18) provides the
border guards carrying out border checks
at the external borders with access to consult the VIS data. This access is for the sole
purpose of verifying the identity of the visa
holder, the authenticity of the visa and / or
whether the conditions for entry to the territory of the Member States are fulfilled.

65 of 80

Frontex · annual risk analysis 2014

During the initial period, between October
2011 and October 2014, this verification can
either be accomplished with the visa sticker
number (VSN) or with the VSN in combination with the fingerprints of the holder. After
October 2014, the verification will be accomplished with the visa sticker number (VSN)
in combination with the fingerprints of the
holder, unless exceptional circumstances (for
instance due to the intensity of traffic) mean
that in accordance with the Schengen Borders Code the visa holder is exempted from
fingerprinting.

VIS on exit. However, a thorough check on
exit comprises, among other things, a verification that the person is in possession of a
valid visa, if required, and it may include consultation with the VIS in accordance with Article 18 of the VIS Regulation.

Thus, as of October 2014, the workload for
border-control authorities will increase significantly. Based on available statistics on
Schengen visas issued in 2012, and assuming
that VIS roll-out took place in Regions 12 to 17,
it can be estimated that about 500 000 VIS
Schengen visas will be issued and will thus
have to be checked by border control. This
estimate does not take into account passengers travelling on multiple entry visas, who
can cross the border several times within a
six-month period.

5.1.4. Budget cuts

Eventually, in 2015, assuming that the VIS rollout takes place in Regions 18 to 23, including
in the Russian Federation, China and Turkey,
the number of VIS visas issued every month
can be estimated at about 1.2 million.

5.2.1. Continued involvement of
organised crime groups

While there were some discussions in 2013
about granting visa-free travel for Russian
citizens, an option that would have considerably changed the impact of the VIS rollout,
at an extraordinary meeting on 6 March 2014,
the European Council (EU heads of state or
government) decided to suspend bilateral
talks with the Russian Federation on visa
matters. This means that, at the time of writing, visa-free travel for Russian citizens has
been postponed indefinitely.
The Schengen Borders Code does not currently impose mandatory consultation of the

66 of 80

It is important to stress that VIS is a tool for
border guards, but the VIS result alone is not
sufficient to refuse entry. When an issue is
spotted during first-line check, passengers
must still be sent to second-line checks for
additional verification and final decision.

The economic crisis led to reductions in public funding in many Member States and at the
EU level. These reductions have already impacted several border-control agencies and
significant annual savings are to be expected
over future budgets, which has an impact
on the capability and capacity to respond to
challenges faced at the border.

5.2. The possible

It is possible that organised crime groups
(OCGs) will get increasingly involved in the
facilitation of smuggling of migrants and trafficking in human beings across the EU. There
are growing reports that facilitators not only
provide assistance to cross the border illegally, but also facilitate the stay of irregular migrants in Member States by providing
fraudulent documents.
However, there remain large uncertainties
as to the level of organisation that can range
from very structured enterprises to opportunistic groups. Little is also known about
the extent of the connection between the
smuggling of migrants and trafficking in human beings. While by definition irregular mi-

gration is linked to international movements,
there remain many unknowns as to the international dimension of the OCGs involved
in these activities. Some information point
to the fact that leader of the OCGs are most
often of the nationality of the smuggled persons, while other indicate the involvement
of many opportunistic groups not necessarily specialising in the smuggling of migrants
from a single nationality.
5.2.2. Document fraud
Given the increasing level of security features
in modern travel documents and stricter migration policies across Member States, the
misuse of genuine travel documents (which
includes impersonation and fraudulently obtained documents) is likely to be an entry
method which will steadily rise.
Some of these issues will be addressed by the
Visa Information System (VIS), which is operational among issuing authorities across
11 regions as of November 2013, and VIS will
be rolled-out to additional regions in 2014
and 2015.
The systematic check on arrivals of VIS visas
is likely to result in increased abuse of fraudulent breeder documents required to obtain
genuine VIS, as well as EU passports which
do not require systematic biometric controls
at the border. In addition, the use of specific
fraudulent techniques to deceive biometric checks, like spoofed fingerprints, is also
likely to increase.

5.3. The unknown
5.3.1. T
 ime and composition of irregular
migration flows
Illegal-migration flows are expected to follow known routes from North Africa and
the Middle East to the EU, mostly by sea and
through the south-eastern land border via

Turkey. The main uncertainties concern the
timing, as well as the size and composition of
the flows. The composition and / or the size
of the flow will vary in response to the developing situation in North Africa and in the
Middle East, particularly in Syria and neighbouring countries.
Swift diversification of modi operandi, possible displacement between routes or border
types, and escalating attempts to evade detection or identification are all likely to occur
in response to enhanced surveillance.
5.3.2. Sudden political and economic
changes
Political evolutions are hard to predict. There
is no assurance that another sharp economic
downturn or social unrest in neighbouring
countries would not spur irregular migration. Though economic and social duress had
long been present in North Africa, the rapidity and extent of the changes brought about
by the Arab Spring that began in December
2010 were largely unexpected.
Similarly, another sharp economic downturn
in the EU, or on the contrary, a strong rebound in economic growth and demand for
labour in the EU, may not be excluded and
may have considerable influence on irregular migration to the EU.
5.3.3. Migrants staying illegally in the EU
There is an intelligence gap on the profile of
persons staying illegally in Member States,
which prevents border-control authorities
from effectively assessing entry criteria, in
particular the assessment for lacking appropriate justification for the purpose of stay. Indeed, the indicator on detections of persons
staying illegally is strongly influenced by the
national resources devoted to their detections. As past experience of regularisation
programmes has shown, the total number of

67 of 80

Frontex · annual risk analysis 2014

detections may under-represent some categories of migrants staying illegally but rather
inconspicuous, like for example Ukrainians
employed as domestic workers or providing
care to the elderly.

68 of 80

5.3.4. Threat of terrorists’ movements

Irrespective of whether avoided or promoted
by terrorist structures, it is possible that irregular migration routes and/or facilitation
networks could be utilised especially if the
associated risks and costs are perceived to
be low in comparison to other legal travel
options.

Overall, there is an underlying threat of terrorism-related travel movements especially
due to the appeal of the Syrian conflict to
both idealist and radicalised youths. The conflict in Syria has attracted hundreds of foreign
fighters, including EU citizens, dual-nationality holders and other third-country nationals. Turkey has become the preferred country
where foreign fighters enter or exit Syria
primarily because of its geographical location plus the availability of legal and cheap
travel options.

Frontex is not in a position to identify, nor
does it have any information that suggests,
any nexus between terrorist travel and irregular migration routings and/or facilitation
networks. Nonetheless, the following possibilities cannot be excluded: changes in the
travelling modi operandi for EU-based fighters after administrative and/or legal measures upon their return; and the reluctance
of third-country national fighters to return
home in fear of reprisal, which may lead them
to resettle elsewhere.

Notes on FRAN data sources and methods
For the data concerning detections at the external borders, some of the border types are
not applicable to all FRAN Member States.
This pertains to data on all FRAN indicators
since the data are provided disaggregated
by border type. The definitions of detections
at land borders are therefore not applicable (excluding borders with non-Schengen
principalities) for Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Iceland,
Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland and
the UK. For Cyprus, the land border refers to
the Green Line demarcation with the area
not under the effective control of the government of the Republic of Cyprus. For sea
borders, the definitions are not applicable for
land-locked Member States including Austria,
the Czech Republic, Hungary, Luxembourg,
Slovakia and Switzerland.
In addition, data on detections of illegal border-crossing at land, air and sea BCPs (1B) are
not available for Iceland, Ireland and Spain
and in Greece (these detections are included
in the data for Indicator 1A). Data for Norway only includes detections of illegal border-crossing at land and sea BCPs (1B), not
between BCPs (1A).
In Italy, detections of illegal border-crossing
at sea BCPs are only reported for intra-EU
border-crossing from Greece. Data on detections of illegal border-crossing between
sea BCPs (1A) are not available for Ireland.
Data on apprehension (FRAN Indicator 2) of
facilitators is not available for Ireland. For Italy, the data are not disaggregated by border
type, but are reported as total apprehensions (not specified). Data for Italy and Norway also include the facilitation of illegal stay
and work. For Romania, the data include
land intra-EU detections on exit at the border with Hungary.

80 of 80

For the data concerning detections of illegal
stay (FRAN Indicator 3), data on detections
at exit are not available for Denmark, Ireland,
Italy, Spain and the UK.
Data on refusals of entry (FRAN Indicator 4)
at the external EU borders are not disaggregated by reason of refusal for Ireland and
the UK. Refusals of entry at the Spanish land
borders at Ceuta and Melilla (without the issuance of a refusal form) are reported separately and are not included in the presented
FRAN data.
The data on applications for international protection (FRAN Indicator 5) are not disaggregated by place of application (type of border
on entry or inland applications) for Austria,
the Czech Republic and Slovenia. For these
countries, only the total number of applications is reported. For France, only asylum
applications at the external borders are reported, not inland applications. For the UK,
data reported for applications at air BCPs also
include applications at sea BCPs.
The data on return decisions issued (FRAN
indicator 7A) are not available for Ireland,
France, the Netherlands and Sweden. The
data on effective returns (FRAN indicator 7B)
are not available for Ireland. In addition, the
data of effective returns are not disaggregated by return operation (voluntary and
forced) for Spain. The data on voluntary effective returns (FRAN Indicator 7A) are not
disaggregated by type of return operation
(IOM-assisted and others) for Belgium, Czech
Republic, Finland and the Netherlands. The
data on forced effective returns (FRAN Indicator 7A) are not disaggregated by type of return operation (enforced by Member Stated
and by Joint Operations) for Belgium, Finland,
Iceland and the Netherlands.
