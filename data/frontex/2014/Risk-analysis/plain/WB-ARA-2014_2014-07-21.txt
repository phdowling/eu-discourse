Frontex official publications fall into four main categories: risk analysis, training, operations
and research, each marked with a distinct graphic identiﬁer. Risk analysis publications bear a
triangular symbol formed by an arrow drawing a triangle, with a dot at the centre. Metaphorically, the arrow represents the cyclical nature of risk analysis processes and its orientation
towards an appropriate operational response. The triangle is a symbol of ideal proportions
and knowledge, reﬂecting the pursuit of factual exactness, truth and exhaustive analysis.
The dot at the centre represents the intelligence factor and the focal point where information from diverse sources converges to be processed, systematised and shared as analytical
products. Thus, Frontex risk analysis is meant to be at the centre and to form a reliable basis for its operational activities.

Executive summary
Overall, 2013 was a year of records. Starting
with more than 40 000 detections for illegal border-crossing at regional and common
green borders*, the number was 27% higher
than during 2012.
Half of all detections occurred at only one
border section: Serbia-Hungary, mostly in
the period between January and July 2013.
The sharp rise of irregular ﬂows at this border section clearly indicated how a change
in asylum procedure of one Member State
(Hungary in this case) can cause massive
shifts and displacements of irregular ﬂows.
At one point during May 2013, this border
section accounted for almost half of all illegal border-crossings at the external borders
of the EU (a 43% share). Following Hungary’s
reintroduction of detention for asylum seekers in July 2013, the ﬂow dropped considerably. Croatia’s accession to the EU in the same
month had no effect on the ﬂow.
As a region surrounded by Member States,
the Western Balkans continued to be largely a
transit area for irregular migratory ﬂows between different Member States and Schengen Associated Countries.
Compared to 2012, detections of transiting
non-European irregular migrants stayed at
roughly the same levels (22 000); however,
signiﬁcant differences emerged in terms of
countries of origin. Namely, the region saw
a sharp decline of migrants from Afghanistan (-44%), North Africa (-36%) and Somalia (-58%) and an unprecedented increase
of detected West Africans (+1 316%). In fact,
West Africans (mostly from Mali, Nigeria
and Ghana) increased their share of the regional total to almost 8%, up from less than
1% during 2012.

The region also re-emerged as an important source of would-be irregular migrants
after three years of constant declines.
However, with 18 000 detections of illegal border-crossing by migrants from the
Western Balkans, the number was still far
below the levels prior to visa liberalisation in 2009 (62 000 detections of illegal
border-crossing).

* For deﬁnition of
common and regional
borders please see the
general map of the
Western Balkans in
Figure 3, page 12.

The most commonly reported modus operandi for irregular movements was still crossing of green borders by foot and subsequent
‘rendezvous’ with the facilitators that provided onward transport. Almost as a matter of standard practice, if detected, migrants
claimed asylum. During 2013, the authorities
from the region managed to dismantle several groups that were providing such service
to the transiting migrants.
Two groups of migrants stood out in this
respect: nationals of Albania whose numbers increased across all indicators used to
measure irregular migration developments.
These include a 60% growth in detections
of illegal border-crossing, 29% rise of illegal
stay detected in the EU and almost identical increase in asylum applications submitted in the EU. Furthermore, Albanians were
the top nationality detected for document
fraud in the EU for the second year in a row.
Roughly 16% of all detections of document
fraudsters or 3 200 cases for all travel types
during 2013 were linked to Albanians. Other
Western Balkan nationalities were detected
in signiﬁcantly lower numbers compared to
Albanians.
The second most notable group driving this
re-emergence of the Western Balkans as
source region were persons coming from the

territory of Kosovo.* Their numbers increased
even more compared to Albanians, mostly
during the ﬁrst half of 2013. In fact, there
were six times more illegal border-crossings

times as many asylum seekers (14 300 or
209% more) compared to 2012.

a plethora of measures to minimise the visa
liberalisation abuse. Our analysis shows that
in the case of nationals from Serbia and the
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, refusals of entry and refusals of exits helped to
prevent an even larger asylum intake during 2013.

This worrying development was largely driven
by regional factors such as the mentioned
changes in asylum policy of Hungary and the
regime governing movements across the Administrative Boundary Line between Kosovo*
and Serbia. As such, the inﬂux from Kosovo*
started to decrease after Hungary reintroduced detention for asylum seekers.

The 33 000 asylum applications from ﬁve
Western Balkan countries represented a staggering 97% share of the total for all visa-free
countries. For comparison, nationals of El
Salvador submitted only 125 asylum applications during 2013.

Continuing with the notion of a record year,
abuse of visa-free travel through subsequent
mostly unfounded asylum application in the
EU remained at the same high levels as during 2012. Namely, nationals of the ﬁve visa exempt Western Balkan countries** submitted
almost 33 000 asylum applications in Member States and Schengen Associated Countries during 2013. This represented 9% of the
total EU asylum intake.
Seven out of ten claims were submitted in
Germany alone with nationals of Serbia still
accounting for a signiﬁcant 45% share of the
total for the ﬁve visa-exempt Western Balkan nationalities.
All Western Balkan countries and neighbouring Member States continued to implement

A comparative analysis of regular passenger ﬂow at Hungary-Serbia borders, refusals of entry issued to Serbian nationals and
asylum abuse in the EU demonstrated that
visa-free travel option is by and large used
by bona ﬁde travellers for the intended purposes. Namely, there were more than 4.5 million entries of Serbian nationals to Hungary
and Croatia during 2013 compared to roughly
15 000 Serbian asylum applications in the EU
and Schengen Associated Countries.
Cross-border criminality, mainly related to
the trafficking of stolen vehicles and the
smuggling of illicit drugs and weapons, represents a sizable threat to border security
in the Western Balkans. New trends of drug
smuggling across the Adriatic are a worrying development.

1. Introduction
As was the case with the previous four issues, this ﬁfth edition of the Western Balkans Annual Risk Analysis (WB-ARA) 2014
has been prepared in cooperation between
the Risk Analysis Units of the competent border-control authorities of Albania, Bosnia and
Herzegovina (BiH), the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYR Macedonia), Montenegro, Serbia and the Frontex Risk Analysis
Unit (RAU).
The joint analytical activity is an integral part
of the Western Balkans Risk Analysis Network (WB-RAN) in which all the mentioned
Western Balkan countries actively participate. WB-RAN was established following
the proposal made by Frontex in May 2009.
The WB-ARA 2014 builds on knowledge from
previous editions of the annual report, re-

porting provided by WB-RAN throughout
2013 and other reporting available to Frontex.
The WB-ARA 2014 is structured around the
following elements: (1) a description of the
general context in which border controls at
common borders occur; (2) annual risk assessment of the main risks affecting both
the area of the Western Balkans and Member States or Schengen Associated Countries;
(3) outlook and (4) the statistical annex of the
WB-ARA 2014 that includes summary tables,
describing the key indicators of irregular migration in detail.
The Frontex Risk Analysis Unit would like to
thank all WB-RAN and FRAN members for
their active participation throughout 2013
and valuable input.

2. Methodology
2.1. Data collection plan
The core of monthly statistical data
from WB-RAN and neighbouring FRAN countries (only common borders) is focused on
six key indicators of illegal migration: (1) detections of illegal border-crossing, (2) detections of facilitators, (3) detections of illegal
stay, (4) refusals of entry, (5) asylum applications and (6) detections of false documents.
In addition to this core data set, other available to Frontex were also used. Those include
data from the European Document Fraud Risk
Analysis Network (EDF), Turkey-Frontex Risk
Analysis Network (TU-RAN) and Frontex reporting from different Join Operations coordinated by Frontex. Importantly, in line with
agreement by all WB-RAN members, Kosovo Border Police was invited to participate
in the work of the network (starting from
2014) and has consequently provided full data
set for 2013, using slightly modiﬁed WB-RAN
monthly statistical template.
Many other qualitative and quantitative
sources were also used, in particular, bimonthly and quarterly analytical reports of
both Member States and WB-RAN countries, FRAN and WB Quarterlies, Frontex
reporting in the context of the post-visaliberalisation monitoring mechanism and
analysis from Frontex Annual Risk Analysis
(ARA 2014). Furthermore, All WB-RAN countries have contributed additional information and graphical material during the 2014
Annual Analytical Review meeting that was
held in Belgrade.
Open sources of information were also used.
Among others, these sources included reports
issued by government agencies, EU institu-

8 of 58

tions and international or non-governmental
organisations. Additional input was provided
by both Member States/Schengen Associated
Countries and WB-RAN countries during the
Frontex Western Balkans Expert meeting on
2 April 2014.

2.2. Quality of available data
Consistent with other law-enforcement indicators, variation in administrative data related
to border control depends on several factors.
In this case, the number of detections of illegal border-crossing and refusals of entry are
both functions of the amount of effort spent
detecting migrants and the ﬂow of irregular migrants. For example, increased detections of illegal border-crossing might be due
to an actual increase in the ﬂow of irregular
migrants, or they may in fact be an outcome
of more resources made available to detect
migrants. In exceptional cases, an inﬂux of resources may produce an increase in reported
detections while effectively masking the actual decrease in the ﬂow of migrants, resulting from a strong deterrent effect.
Important changes in the collection and use
of data for this WB-ARA 2014 were introduced due to Croatia joining the EU in July
2013. Firstly, data for Slovenia, which now
has no external borders with non-EU countries, have no longer been included in the
report. Slovenian historical data were also
excluded from the tables in order to make
the comparison with previous years analytically meaningful.
Secondly, as Croatia-Hungary and CroatiaSlovenia border sections have now become
internal EU-borders they are no longer covered by the statistical annex of this report.

Thirdly, after joining the EU, Croatian data
on illegal stay data are limited to detections
at the border. More precisely, Croatia’s illegal stay data only include cases detected on
exit, while inland detections are not included.
The analysis of the illegal stay indicator takes
this fact into consideration.

2.3. Application of the Common
Integrated Risk Analysis
Model (CIRAM)
In line with the previous edition of this annual report, the 2014 WB-ARA considers
risk as deﬁned by the updated CIRAM; a
function of threat, vulnerability and impact.

Such an approach endeavours to emphasise risk analysis as a key tool in ensuring
the optimal allocation of resources within
constraints of budget, staff and efficiency
of equipment.
According to the model, a ‘threat’ is a force
or pressure acting upon the external borders
that is characterised by both its magnitude
and likelihood; ‘vulnerability’ is deﬁned as the
capacity of a system to mitigate the threat
and ‘impact’ is determined as the potential
consequences of the threat. In this way, the
structured and systematic breakdown of risk
is presented in the annual risk assessment
and conclusions chapters.

3.1. Border controls
3.1.1. Regular passenger ﬂows at land
borders
The region of the Western Balkans is well connected with transport infrastructure, has a
large mobile population and fairly few barriers to mobility of people and goods. Regular
traffic across regional and common borders
is therefore signiﬁcant, probably one of the
most dynamic regions adjacent to the EU.
With notable exception of the territory of
Kosovo*, all other inhabitants from the region enjoy visa-free option when travelling
to the Schengen area and the EU.
Available passenger and vehicle ﬂow data
suggest extensive movements of people inside the region itself and even more towards
the neighbouring Member States. For example, only Serbia cross-border movements exFigure 4. The most extensive movements
took place among Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Serbia and Croatia and between Serbia and
Hungary

ceeded 50 million during 2013. This Western
Balkan country lies on the main trading route
in the region and is therefore an excellent example of the regular ﬂows affecting the region as a whole.
As demonstrated by Figure 4, around two
thirds of the ﬂow was between Serbia and
the neighbouring EU while the rest remained
in the region. The two most affected external
borders of the EU were the one with Croatia
(a 23% share) and Hungary (20%).
In terms of travel choices made by nationals of Serbia, the border with Hungary was
the most affected with more than two and
a half million registered entries into the EU.
This border section, however, was not the
most balanced in terms of entry/exit statistics with a higher number of entries towards
Hungary compared to returns back to Serbia (see Fig. 4).

* This designation is
without prejudice to
positions on status,
and is in line with
UNSCR 1244 and the
ICJ Opinion on the
Kosovo declaration of
independence.

The ratio between entries and exits can serve
as a proxy measurement of bona ﬁde travel
patterns since it provides an indication into
how many persons exited a country and later
returned in a given ﬁxed period, hence did
not overstay the duration of the relevant legal stay conditions. Altogether, Serbian nationals made more than 10.7 million exits
towards neighbouring countries during 2014
while there were slightly less than 10 million
entries back to Serbia.
At the border section with Hungary the difference was around 330 000. At other borders with the neighbouring Member States
(Romania, Croatia and Bulgaria), these differences were largely negligible. This would
indicate that the border with Hungary is the
main entry point for Serbian nationals that
tend to stay in the EU for a longer period of
time, including those that abuse visa-free
travel by claiming asylum in the EU without
sufficient justiﬁcation.

3.1.2. Signiﬁcant vehicle traffic
Given the large number of regular passengers
crossing regional and common borders, it is
hardly surprising that the number of different vehicles checked is also extremely high.
At the borders of Bosnia and Herzegovina
for example, there were almost 17 million
vehicles checked by the border authorities
during entry or exit from Bosnia and Herzegovina. Compared to the border between Poland and Ukraine, this number is signiﬁcantly
higher than, for example, the Polish border
with Belarus, where roughly 4 million vehicles are recorded passing on an annual basis.

* This designation is
without prejudice to
positions on status,
and is in line with
UNSCR 1244 and the
ICJ Opinion on the
Kosovo declaration of
independence.

14 of 58

In the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina, passenger cars accounted for 90% of all vehicles
checked, followed distantly by heavy trucks or
lorries (1 185 000 or 7% of the total). Importantly, there were also almost 300 000 buses
and 10 000 trains crossing different borders
of Bosnia and Herzegovina during 2013.
Most of the vehicles were checked at the borders of Bosnia and Herzegovina with the EU.

In fact, 77% of all vehicles at different borders
of Bosnia and Herzegovina were checked on
entry from or exit to the EU (Croatia).
3.1.3. Composition of regular passenger
ﬂows
When planning resources for border checks
a sound understanding of composition of
the regular ﬂows at a given border is quite
important. In the case of the Western Balkans and the neighbouring Member States,
most regular passengers at the regional or
the common borders are either EU nationals or come from the region itself.
Given the visa liberalisation process and the
fact that Western Balkan countries have all
bilateral visa-free arrangements in place, a
vast majority of passengers during 2013 did
not need visa to cross the regional and common borders. The only notable exceptions
from this general rule were nationals of Turkey and persons arriving from the territory

A thorough analysis of all FRAN and WB-RAN
indicators shows that, compared to 2012, irregular migration pressure from or linked to
Western Balkan countries increased for the
third year in a row. While there were many
interesting changes in the indicators, this
short overview only focuses on the most
important ones in terms of identiﬁed risks.

3.2.1. In the Western Balkans region
Detections of illegal border-crossing between
BCPs increased from 31 400 in 2012 to 40 000
in 2013 (+27%). Unlike during 2012, this time
around the growth of detections was by and
large driven by regional nationalities, namely
Albanians and persons from the territory
of Kosovo.* Consequently and indicated by
Figure 7, the share of Western Balkan nationals rose for the ﬁrst time since 2009 to
reach the current 45% of the total.
However, with 18 000 detections of illegal
border-crossing by migrants from the Western Balkans, the number is still far below
the levels prior to visa liberalisation in 2009
(62 000 detections).
Compared to 2012, detections of the transiting non-European irregular migrants stayed
at roughly the same levels (22 000), however,
signiﬁcant differences emerged in terms of
countries of origin. Namely, the region saw
a sharp decline of migrants from Afghanistan (-44%), North Africa (-36%) and Somalia (-58%) and an unprecedented increase of
detected West Africans (+1 316%) and Syrians
(+84%). In fact, West Africans (mostly Mali,
Nigeria and Ghana) increased their share of
regional total to almost 8%, up from less than
1% during 2012.
Most of the detections were reported at land
border between Hungary and Serbia, where
the numbers rose by staggering 338% (both

tween Greece and Albania, the two sections
amounted to three quarters of all detections
of illegal border crossing in the region.
This sudden increase and displacement towards Hungary-Serbia border was largely
driven by changes in Hungarian asylum policy, described in more detail in Section 3.2.3.
(Underlying factors for the changes in the
indicators).
At the border between Greece and Albania, the increase was less pronounced (46%)
compared to 2012. It was mostly due to Albanians trying to illegally enter Greece (+56%,
circular migration); however, nationals of Pakistan, Syria and Eritrea were also detected
in higher numbers en route from Greece towards Albania.

16 of 58

Claiming asylum in the Western Balkans itself and absconding afterwards continued
to grow as a part of the well-known modus operandi to move from Greece towards
other Member States (secondary movements). In fact, overall asylum applications
increased substantially in most Western Balkan countries. Most notably, the increase
was extremely high in Montenegro (+128%,
or 3 475). In per capita terms, there was one
asylum application for every 200 citizens of
Montenegro.
The phenomenon in Montenegro was largely
driven by applicants from Pakistan who were
en route from Greece through Albania.

tionalities, submitted only 125 asylum applications during 2013.

Abuse of visa-free travel through subsequent unfounded asylum application in the
EU continued at the same high levels as during 2012. Namely, nationals of the ﬁve visa exempt Western Balkan countries submitted
almost 33 000 asylum applications in Member States and Schengen Associated Countries during 2013. This represented 9% of the
total EU asylum intake. If asylum applications from Kosovo* are added to this number, the share rises to more than 13% of the
EU total. Seven out of ten claims were submitted in Germany alone.

In the same time, refusals of entry issued
by Member States and Schengen Associated Countries to nationals of the Western
Balkan countries rose by 17%, most notably
with regards to nationals of Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. This increasing trend
was largely in line with the overall increase
of refusals of entry issued at external land
borders of the EU.

The 33 000 asylum applications from ﬁve
Western Balkan countries represent a staggering 97% share of the total for all visa-free
countries. For comparison, nationals of El
Salvador, ranked sixth among visa-free na-

Detections of illegal stay in Member States
and Schengen Associated Countries increased
by 16%, mostly due to nationals of Albania and
Kosovo.* This overall trend was quite the opposite compared to the overall EU trend given
that detection of illegal stay across all Member States and Schengen Associated Countries during 2013 stayed at the same levels as
during year before.

The growth of detections at the Croatia-Slovenia and Serbia-Croatia borders during 2012
(double the number compared to 2011) was
clearly indicating a westward shift as most irregular migrants were increasingly attempting to cross from Serbia to Croatia and further
to Slovenia rather than to Hungary.

This situation changed dramatically at the
beginning of 2013 when Hungary, following
international pressure, stopped the practice of detention for persons in asylum procedure. More precisely, asylum seekers who
immediately asked for asylum upon being
apprehended by the police (before the end
of their ﬁrst interview) were not detained.
Instead, they were all accommodated in an
open facility from where they were able to
continue their journey, resulting in signiﬁcant absconding rates.

Source: FRAN and WB-RAN data as of 1 March 2014

Despite the 14% decrease compared to 2012,
Albanian nationals continued to dominate
the rankings when it comes to document
fraud detected by Member States and Schengen Associated Countries. For the second
year running, they were the top nationality with more than 3 200 cases or 16% of
the EU total for 2013. Most of detections for
document fraud with regards to Albanians
occurred between the Schengen area and
non-Schengen EU Member States, largely en
route from Italy to the UK. These observations continue to demonstrate that Albanian
nationals are by far the most diverse, when
compared to other Western Balkan nationalities, in terms of destination choices and
modi operandi used.

In addition, submission of asylum application also constituted an explicit ban of removal from the territory which in practical
terms prevented possible rapid readmission to Serbia. Furthermore, asylum seekers returned under the Dublin II procedure
to Hungary from another Member State or
Schengen Associated Country were not detained any more.
These policy decisions caused a massive shift
away from Serbia-Croatia border to the one
between Hungary and Serbia (see Fig. 10).
The shift was so important that during June
2013 there were only 39 detections at both
sides of the border between Serbia and Croatia compared to roughly 4 100 at the border
between Hungary and Serbia. As indicated
by Figure 10, almost all detected migrants in

The development in Hungary also shows how
quickly routing can shift. More precisely, during the peak period between April and June
2013, the border section between Hungary
and Serbia was the top reporting external
border section of the EU. In May 2013, for
example, almost one in two migrants detected for illegal border-crossing at all external borders of the EU was detected at this
border section.
Croatia joins the EU
The accession of Croatia to the EU took place
on 1 July 2013. The numbers across all the indicators reported by Croatia either decreased
or were basically unaffected by this historic
development. As shown by Figure 11, illegal
border-crossings reported by Croatia started

to decrease dramatically at the beginning
of 2013. This development was linked to the
previously mentioned changes in the Hungarian asylum policy and therefore had little to do with the upcoming EU membership
of Croatia.
Similarly, the increase in detections of illegal
border-crossing after July 2013 (peak in October 2013) was again mostly related to developments in Hungary. In conclusion, illegally
entering Hungary from Serbia has many advantages compared to routing through Croatia. This new Member State is not a member
of the Schengen area and, starting from 1 July
2013, detected irregular migrants face possible Dublin II return to Croatia if detected
for illegal border-crossing or claiming asylum there.

This episode clearly demonstrated the extensive impact that a decision by one Member State can have on the choice of route,
modi operandi, direction and the volume of
irregular movements across the Western
Balkans. To large extent, this was the most
striking development during 2013 with cascading effects on all Western Balkan countries en route from Greece or Bulgaria to
Hungary.

Hungarian government responded by reintroducing detention for asylum seekers
starting from 1 July 2013. Consequently, the
numbers decreased by as much as 78% compared to the peak month of June 2013. In the
same time, detections at Serbia-Croatia border rose to reach 350 during September 2013.
Combined, the numbers from both sides of
the border during the last four months of
2013 returned largely to levels observed during the same period in 2012.

expected to be ready by April 2014. It will

and should thus help to prevent illegal
border-crossing on foot

Operational measures at the BulgarianTurkish border
Detections at the land border between Bulgaria and Turkey represented 45% of the detections on the Eastern Mediterranean route
during 2013. At this border area, detections
increased considerably between August 2012
and October 2013, a direct consequence of
additional measures taken by Greece (Aspida and Xenios Zeus operations).

In response to the increased pressure and
following the example of the Greek-Turkish land border fence, Bulgarian authorities
started the construction of a 30-kilometre
technical engineering obstacle in the border area between the villages of Lesovo and
Kraynovo. This obstacle will be part of the
Integrated Border Surveillance System (IBSS)
that is planned to cover the entire border section with Turkey by June 2015.
In addition to constructing the obstacle, Bulgarian authorities also initiated a special operation further strengthening their border
surveillance with additional (almost 1 600)

staff and assets deployed in the area. This
resulted in a drop in the number of irregular
migrants apprehended during the last two
months of 2013 (see Fig. 13). The trend has
also continued in 2014.
The effects of the displacement away from
Greece towards Bulgaria were clearly visible
at the border between Serbia and Bulgaria,
where detections of illegal border-crossing
rose from only 40 during 2012 to more than
500 during 2013. Migrants were detected almost exclusively by Serbian authorities on entry from Bulgaria. The ﬂow consisted of the
same nationalities as those detected at Bulgaria-Turkey border which indicates a direct
link between the two ﬂows.

Boundary Line (ABL) between Kosovo* and
Serbia. According to signed agreements, there
are regular weekly meetings between both
sides on the ABL. There is also a regional
meeting taking place every month.
Starting from 2013, travellers from Kosovo*
that are using the new Kosovo* machinereadable ID are given entry/exit papers by
Serbian traffic police when crossing the ABL.
Entry/exit document allows the person to
stay legally in Serbia. It is assumed that most
of Kosovo* citizens that applied for asylum in
Hungary (after illegal border-crossing) during
2013 obtained such entry/exit documents and
thus travelled legally through Serbia.
The ABL checks are governed by valid agreements between Kosovo* and Serbia at the
level of the Prime Ministers, all under the auspices of the EU. The ABL is in fact not considered as external border by Serbia. Therefore,

Serbian Traffic Police at ABL does not check
if a person meets the conditions for entry
into the EU when issuing these entry/exit
documents.

By the end of 2013, Turkish Airlines had established 215 destinations with direct ﬂights

main connection hub for Asia, Africa, the Middle East, the Western Balkans and the Commonwealth of Independent States.
When it comes to Africa, Turkish Airlines
now operates 33 destinations, more than
any other international carrier. It has a dominant position in the existing market of West
Africa, ﬂying to nine destinations in the region (including launch of ﬂights to Cotonou

Low detection ﬁgures reported by Kosovo* for 2013
Following recommendations by the EC and WB-RAN members, Frontex and Kosovo* established direct contacts in a
status-neutral manner. This allowed for Kosovo Border Police to initiate statistical data exchange with Frontex using
a slightly modiﬁed WB-RAN template.
As indicated by the ﬁgure below, Kosovo Border Police detected
only 215 illegal border-crossings during 2013. For comparison,
this number was lower than the average daily detections made
at Hungary-Serbia borders during the peak period.
Furthermore, only 15% of this number was associated with
illegal migration purposes. Smuggling and other reasons for
illegal border-crossings (local commuting or similar) constituted a large proportion of the irregular ﬂow.
The most affected section was the Administrative Boundary Line (ABL) where almost half of all detections occurred.
85% of all detected persons were local or regional inhabitants.
This would indicate that Kosovo* is much less affected by the
secondary movements from Turkey and that Pristina airport
is obviously not used for entry of non-European migrants
to Europe with intention to move illegally towards the EU.

in Benin). Several of the regional airports are
served with double-drop operations (Abidjan, Dakar and Ouagadougou). According to
available data from the end of 2013, Turkish
Airlines now offers almost 5 800 seats per
week on ﬂights from eight airports in West
Africa alone.
The expanding number of seats offered by
Turkish Airlines is clearly indicative of relative
high demand for ﬂying from West Africa to
Istanbul. Given the existence of Turkish e-visa
system, it has never been easier for wouldbe migrants from West Africa to get access
to the external borders of the EU through
Turkey.
Increased effectiveness of operational
measures taken to reduce the abuse of
legal travel channels (visa liberalisation)
As stated many times by the European Commission, abuse of visa liberalisation has to be
addressed on many levels. Border controls are
only one element of this mitigation strategy.
Still, border-control authorities of Western
Balkan countries and Member States have
been constantly improving their capability
to prevent subsequent abuse by issuing refusals of entry or refusal of exit.
In the case of nationals of Serbia, consistently
the most numerous group submitting unfounded asylum applications in the EU, there
was a sharp 45% increase in refusals of entry
issued during 2013 (see Fig. 14) .
Hungary refused entry to almost 5 400 Serbian nationals, 65% more compared to 2012.
Refusals by Hungary amounted to two thirds
of all refusals of entry issued to Serbian nationals at the external border of the EU during 2013. Almost 75% of refusals were issued
for reason largely linked to visa liberalisation
abuse. In addition to refusals of entry issued
by Hungary, Serbian authorities also refused

exit to more than 6 500 Serbian citizens who
could not justify their intended stay in the EU
and were thus considered risk passengers.
Altogether, border authorities from Hungary and Serbia prevent entry to ﬁve persons
per every 1 000 passengers. This is a significantly higher share compared to averages
at other land border sections of the EU. As
clearly demonstrated by Figure 15, monthly
refusals of entry or exit were broadly following the trends of asylum applications of
Serbian nationals in the EU. This would indicate that measures taken at Hungary-Serbia border possibly prevented even larger
asylum abuse by Serbian nationals in the
EU during 2013.
This is also somewhat indicative of the fact
that border-control authorities of both the
most affected Member States and the neighbouring Western Balkan countries are applying the Schengen Borders Code and national
legislation to their fullest when performing
border checks.
All other visa-exempt Western Balkan nationalities have also demonstrated additional
commitment during 2013 to further reduce
the extent of asylum abuse associated with
the visa liberalisation. As shown by the case
of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (see box overleaf), the set of operational
measures led to increasing numbers of refusals of exit and detected criminal offences
linked to abuse of visa-free regime.

‘Name change’ modus operandi
successfully addressed by Albania
The well-established modus operandi
whereby a person would simply change
his/her name in order to circumvent an
active Schengen Information System (SIS)
entry ban has been successfully addressed
by the Albanian authorities. Namely, several safeguards were introduced into the
procedure (e.g. maximum one change, not
allowed for persons with immigration infringement history, involvement of border
police in the process).

have probably prevented higher level of asylum abuse in the second

Almost one third was made by persons who
were either refused entry into the EU or were
returned from Member States back to Albania due to immigration or criminal offense.
Name change requests of this group were almost exclusively made with the intention to
negate an active entry ban.

Measures to counter the abuse of visa-free travel channel:
the case of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
Operational measures
1. Strengthened exit controls continued in 2013: check of necessary ﬁnancial means, conducting interviews in reference to
their destination, the purpose and the motives for the travel.
Should there be indications that the real intention for the
travelling is to abuse the right to asylum, the person is refused exit in accordance with Article 15 of the Law on Border Control.
2. Improved proﬁling of persons likely to abuse asylum in the EU:
this includes identifying municipalities from where they most
failed asylum seekers come from. Such updated analysis is
delivered monthly to all Regional Centres for Border Affairs,
as well as to all BCPs.
In 2013, the number of refusals of exit was 6 700 or 41% more
compared to 2012.
3. Strengthened repressive measures: in 2013, authorities detected
three times more criminal offences of ‘abuse of visa-free regime with the Member States of the European Union and
the Schengen Agreement’, and doubled the number of
convicted perpetrators.

4. Annual risk assessment 2014
As introduced in our previous annual analyses
(WB-ARA 2012 and WB-ARA 2013), the annual risk assessment is guided by the CIRAM
working deﬁnition of risk as a function of
three main components: threat, vulnerability and impact.* It largely builds on the main
ﬁndings from the same exercise last year.
In addition, it also takes into account the outcome from Annual Analytical Review with
Member States and Schengen Associated
Countries’ analysts and a similar Workshop
with WB-RAN countries (both events occurred in January 2014).
The selection of the main risks largely builds
on WB-ARA 2013. It also draws heavily from a
detailed analysis of the available monthly statistical data (FRAN, WB-RAN and EDF-RAN),
Frontex operational data and bi-monthly or
quarterly analytical reports provided by both
FRAN and WB-RAN members.

4.1. Risk of large and sustained
secondary movements
from Turkey through the
Western Balkans
4.1.1. Description of the threat
Illegal border-crossing at green borders
A sharp increase in the number of detected
migrants from the region itself, mostly from
Kosovo** and Albania, has led to a partial reversal of the trend from recent years when
transiting migrants en route from Greece or
Bulgaria were increasing their overall share
in the total detections in the region. In fact,
during 2013, this group of migrants was de-

tected in slightly lower numbers (from 22 500
to 22 000), however, they’ve maintained the
dominant 55% share of the regional total.
Composition of the ﬂow
Following the declining trend of Afghans arriving to the EU from Turkey, the regional
borders also recorded an important 44% decrease in detected migrants from Afghanistan. Pakistanis, on the other hand, were
detected in slightly higher numbers (+5%)
due to many long-term migrants deciding
to leave Greece in 2013. Overall, the share of
Southeast Asians, the number one group of
migrants in 2012, dropped to 26% during 2013.

* According to the
CIRAM model, a
‘threat’ is a force or
pressure acting upon
the external borders
that is characterised by
both its magnitude and
likelihood; ‘vulnerability’
is deﬁned as the capacity
of a system to mitigate
the threat and ‘impact’
is determined as the
consequences of the
threat.

Western Africans signiﬁcantly increased their
share of the regional total from less than 1%
in 2012 to almost 8% during 2013. The numbers increased in particular in relation to nationals of Mali (671 or 932% more), Nigeria (581
or 1 774% more), Ghana (from 4 to 391), Côte
d’Ivoire (from 9 to 353), Senegal and Guinea.
As mentioned above, all these countries are
now connected with Istanbul airport through
direct ﬂights operated by Turkish Airlines.
While Pakistanis were the most commonly
reported nationality among non-regional migrants, Syrians (ranked third among transiting migrants) increased their numbers the
most compared to the other top ﬁve nationalities. This development is hardly surprising
given the worrying humanitarian crisis pushing many Syrians towards the EU. Consequently, detections of Syrians have increased
throughout the region of the Western Balkans, Turkey and at different sections of the
external borders of the EU.

positions on status, and is

and the ICJ Opinion on
the Kosovo declaration of

Routing

Modi operandi

The border section between Hungary and
Serbia was by far the busiest border section
during 2013, mainly for reasons described earlier. Almost 13 000 non-regional transiting
migrants were detected there by both Serbia and Hungary. This represented a staggering 57% share of the regional total, up from
only 14% during 2012.

By far the most commonly used method by
irregular migrants in the Western Balkans is
a simple crossing of green borders on foot
and subsequent transport by car, taxi, van or
regular bus lines. This option is cheap, usually
does not require facilitators to be present during the crossings and information about optimal places to do the crossing is easily shared
among would-be migrants (through the internet, Facebook and web-forums).

Combined with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Serbia border, this two
sections accounted for eight out of ten of all
detected illegal border-crossings linked to
transiting migrants in the region.
Consequently, Serbia and Hungary were the
most impacted countries in the region with
transiting migrants tending to spend the
most time there.

Effective surveillance is probably the best tool
to counter this method as clearly shown by
footage from Albanian border with Montenegro. In one case alone, images of SMARTDEC*
cameras installed at green border (railway)
with Montenegro enabled Albanian Border
Police to detect four migrants who were attempting illegal border-crossing.

* SMARTDEC is an
electronic border guard
for perimeter surveillance
in remote areas. Small,
wireless, and easily
camouﬂaged detectors
that are equipped with a
camera and long-lasting
batteries. Cameras
are linked to motion
sensors that relay visual
conﬁrmation (semimotion video) in a matter
of seconds. The cameras
are programmed to only
recognise human and
vehicular inﬁltrations.

illegally and enter Montenegro

Movements from Greece closer to the border with Albania were often done using public transport. Often, migrants were detected
for illegal border-crossing as part of mixed
groups of different nationalities and up to 15
persons. Interestingly, Albanian border Police
detected more than 100 persons who tried to
cross the border from Greece to Albania two
or three times, indicating thus the existence
of a repetitive cycle of illegal border-crossing, readmission, followed by another illegal
border-crossing.
Serbia primarily reported cases where transport was provided to migrants. In one such
incident from June 2013, a Serbian citizen was
arrested as facilitator after 22 irregular migrants were found in his van during regular
police checks close to border with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. There
were no special compartments in the van.
The migrants were mostly from West Africa
(see Fig. 21) and have crossed green borders
on foot, without a guide. The arrested facilitator was waiting for them in Serbia.
In another case, an arrested Serbian citizen
was transporting ﬁve foreign nationals in
his private car. The migrants were aged between 20 and 30 years, four were from Eritrea
and one from Somalia. Police investigation
showed that the driver received only around
EUR 100 and the cost of fuel as his payment

28 of 58

to transport the ﬁve migrants close to Hungarian border. The migrants had illegally entered from the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia and were picked up by the arrested person in Bujanovac (south Serbia).
The arrested person was only responsible for
one leg of the journey. Serbian Police suspect
that he was in fact hired by smugglers who
are probably not on the territory of Serbia.
Likewise, the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia reported one case that involved
a group that was charging around EUR 120–
200 per person for transport from Greece
to a region near the border with Serbia. For
additional EUR 100 the group was offered
transport across Serbia towards the EU. This
was done by relying on services from other
groups in Serbia.
The authorities in Skopje concluded that this
criminal group alone provided facilitation to
more than 250 migrants from Afghanistan,
Pakistan, Sudan, Syria and other countries.
One of the members of the group was a former migrant from Sudan who had travelled
the route previously.
In Montenegro, authorities successfully dismantled two international criminal organisations that were engaged in facilitation of
hundreds of migrants en route from Greece

© Serbian Border Police

Figure 21. In this case alone, there were 22 West Africans detected in a van, registered in
Montenegro and driven by a Serbian citizen

towards other Member States (police operation ‘Route’). Criminal charges were ﬁled
against the citizens of Montenegro, Pakistan, Morocco and Sudan. The accused were
providing temporary accommodation and
transport from Montenegro to Serbia using
alternative roads outside the border crossing points.

Collected intelligence by Serbian authorities
indicated that organisers were often former
non-European migrants staying in Bulgaria
or Serbia or were Serbian nationals previously involved in smuggling of goods across
the border. Communication between organisers and local facilitators was done using internet and disposable mobile phones.

In the case of the border between Serbia and
Bulgaria, criminal investigations from Serbia
suggest that Bulgarian and/or Serbian citizens
transported migrants to the vicinity of the
green border and provided instructions how
to cross the border on foot. Google applications (Google Maps and Google Earth) were
also used for guidance of migrants across the
border. During the drive through Bulgaria
there was often one car used as vanguard
in front of a car transporting migrants in order to minimise the risk of inland detection.

These cases would indicate that facilitation
services are organised in stages, relatively
inexpensive and often arranged by former
migrants. Dismantling such smuggling organisations is therefore very difficult.

After green border crossing, the migrants
were picked up again by the same drivers
and transported closer to the border with
Hungary.
Local facilitators from Bulgaria and Serbia
also engaged taxi drivers to take migrants
to the river Timok to cross the border illegally without assistance of facilitators and
later to be taken over by taxi drivers while
already on the Serbian side.

Hiding in vehicles
Unlike the stable trend reported for illegal
border-crossing between BCPs (green borders), detections of migrants hiding in vehicles when trying to cross regional or common
borders decreased by 29% compared to 2012.
This indicates a reversal of the trend from 2012
when all top ﬁve border sections reported
various degrees on increase and is therefore
indicative of a return to simple crossing of
green borders on foot.
This notion is further corroborated by signiﬁcantly lower detections of migrants on
cargo trains that departed in Greece en route
to Austria (only two persons in 2013). There
were also no cases detected by Austria of mi-

sections reported lower numbers compared
to 2012. The top three nationalities trying to
hide in vehicles were hardly a surprise: Syrians, Afghans and Pakistanis.
In most cases, migrants were hiding in vehicles without the knowledge of drivers. This
modus operandi is cheap, requires little planning
and therefore allows for multiple attempts if
detected. The method usually involves hopping on vehicles at known lorry stops close
to the main exit points in Greece. Once the
driver is asleep, migrants cut all security features and hide in the cargo area. They either
do this without external help or solicit services from fellow migrants or local facilitators.
The case shown in the photos from Albania
(Fig. 23) is typical in this respect. Namely, the
three detected migrants from Pakistan managed to gain access to the cargo area of the
lorry during the night. Albanian Border Police
was able to detect them by simply noticing
the fact that security seals were broken. This
was a further sign that no outside help was

provided and that no attempt was made to
conceal the presence of migrants in the lorry.

Given the sheer magnitude of the transiting
ﬂow, the capacity of the system to accommodate all those requiring assistance is limited. In addition, many migrants leave the
two centres or shelters on their own initiative only to ﬁnd themselves in a very precarious situation later on. Consequently, many
transiting migrants, especially during winter
months, are exposed to the elements and
live in appalling conditions, such as the one
shown in Figure 24.
Open source reporting suggests that migrants often have to seek emergency medical help due to frost bites and infectious
diseases such as tuberculosis. In one such
incident, at least three irregular migrants
were hospitalised in Serbia during January 2014 after they have left asylum centre of their own accord and consequently
suffered serious frostbites due to exposure. One of them, a claimed Somali, is also
treated for tuberculosis in the hospital in the
town of Valjevo (see Fig. 25). These migrants
stated that they were trying to reach other
Member States (in this case the UK) on foot
(hence the exposure to the cold weather)
because they could not afford public transport or facilitation services.

Security concerns and conﬂict with local
inhabitants
Protests of local inhabitants against establishment of shelters for irregular migrants,
asylum seekers or other persons in need have
continued in Serbia during 2013. Protest are
mostly peaceful (road blockades), however,
there were also instances where temporary housing for migrants was burned down
in order to prevent the authorities to move
persons in need to these locations. On occasions, road blocks have cut delivery of essential supplies (water, food) to these shelters.
Police had to intervene several times and
safety concerns of local inhabitants are often
exacerbated by the fact that the two asylum
centres are both located in small towns and
that often the ration between asylum seekers and local people is 1:1.

Serbia continues to be the most affected
country both in terms of volume and extensive diversity of the mixed secondary
movements of transiting irregular migrants,
refugees and asylum seekers. Serbia has two
asylum centres and several shelters across its
territory with roughly 500 available places.
There are also many temporary facilities that
allow Serbian authorities to provide housing
to additional persons in need.

Pakistanis residing illegally in Greece for extended period before moving towards Albania
The three detected Pakistanis were staying in Greece many
years before deciding to move to Italy through the Western
Balkans. They were proﬁcient in Greek language and their
decision to move was associated with a sort of desperation
with the conditions in Greece. The group was also carrying
documents issued by Greek authorities and were obviously
detected for illegal stay in Greece.
The two documents, a court decision and a police-issued
document, are both related to return/stay/terms of the migrants in question.

4.1.2. New developments
Long way round from Greece to Italy
through the Western Balkans
During 2013, many Afghans and Pakistanis
interviewed at the asylum registration centre (CARA) in Crotone (southern Italy) suggested that they had used the longer land
route through the Western Balkan countries when travelling from Greece to Italy
instead of a much shorter maritime passage (see Fig. 26). Subsequent reporting indicated that this practice continued during
the ﬁrst months of 2014. In fact, as of February 2014, there were roughly 1 500 persons in the CARA Crotone. A majority of
them were most likely travelling through
the Western Balkans.
The main reason for choosing the longer
route is the price. Namely, the land route
through the Western Balkans costs half
the price (EUR 1 500–1 800) compared to
the direct sea route or air option (both cost
around EUR 3 000). In addition, Afghan and
Pakistani nationals were advised by relatives
or by other migrants to go to CARA in Crotone, where they believed that it would be
easier to obtain residence documents and
some basic services (food, clothes and daily
allowance).

© Albanian Border Police

Most of these migrants that took the land
route to reach Italy were longer-term irregular stayers in Greece and have decided to
move to other Member States in response
to deteriorating economic and security situation in Greece.
Afghan nationals reached the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia border either
travelling by themselves or accompanied by
facilitators. Along the route, the facilitators,
who are involved in the smuggling of irregular migrants, are mainly from Afghanistan,
Bangladesh, Hungary, Pakistan and Serbia.

Furthermore, the share of the ﬁve visa-exempt nationalities in the overall EU total (as
reported in FRAN) dropped from 12% during 2012 to the current 9%. This is roughly

of El Salvador, ranked sixth among visa-free
nationalities, submitted only 125 asylum applications during 2013.
Distribution of asylum applications by
Member States and Schengen Associated
Countries
As indicated by Figure 28, the trends were
very divergent in most Member States and
Schengen Associated Countries. By far the
most important development during 2013
was the almost complete displacement of
asylum applications towards Germany, where
22 242 applications were submitted. This represented almost 70% of the total asylum intake from the ﬁve visa-exempt nationalities
in the EU and was signiﬁcantly higher than
the 48% share of Germany during 2012. Together with Sweden, where numbers declined
by 42%, the two Member States handled eight
out of ten of all asylum claims in 2013.
According to information provided by Germany*, this Member State became the favourite destination for asylum seekers from
the Western Balkans mainly due to the highest per capita (social) payments in Europe.
Signiﬁcant rise of asylum applications was
recorded after the Federal Constitutional
Court decided (July 2012) to increase social
beneﬁts as well as payments for asylumseekers (reaching EUR 350 per person per
month). Longer asylum procedures are therefore very advantageous for those that treat
it as a source of ﬁnancial gains.

In response to this increasing inﬂux, German
authorities are drafting legal changes that
would allow asylum authorities to consider

safe countries of origin.

Schengen Associated Countries. While during 2012 Germany Sweden, Switzerland, Belgium and Luxembourg were topping the list,
the year under observation saw the UK and
Denmark joining the top ﬁve, ranking third
and ﬁfth, respectively. Luxembourg and Switzerland dropped out from the top ﬁve following signiﬁcant declines of asylum applications
there (-71% and -79%).
As during 2012, the top ﬁve Member States
and Schengen Associated Countries handled
90% of all asylum applications (around 29 300).
The UK and Denmark reported an increasing trend for the second year in a row, however both were the only other two Member
States with more than 500 asylum applications from the ﬁve visa-exempt targeted almost exclusively by only two nationalities,
respectively; Albanian (the UK) and Serbian
nationals (Denmark).

Distribution by Western Balkan nationalities
Unlike during 2012 when all ﬁve visa-exempt
Western Balkan nationalities submitted more
asylum applications compared to 2011, the
trend was quite diverse in 2013. Namely, only
Albanian nationals submitted more asylum
applications by a substantial margin (28%),
while the other four either remained roughly
at the levels of 2012 or even recorded a decrease like in the case of Montenegro.

* For the Netherlands
in 2012, data are
available only for top ten
nationalities. For France,
only asylum applications
at the external borders
are reported, not inland
applications..

Unsurprisingly, Serbian nationals remained by
far the top nationality with almost 15 000 applications or 45% share of the total. Compared
to 2012, the share of Serbian applications in
the total for the ﬁve visa-exempt nationalities fell by 3 percentage points, largely due
to the increasing trend associated with nationals of Albania.

Germany was by far the most preferred
destination. Apart from Albanians whose
preference was the UK (but very closely
followed by Germany), all other four visaexempt nationalities submitted a vast proportion of their applications in this Member
State. For example, three quarters of asylum applications from nationals of Serbia
were submitted in Germany. The share of
Germany was even higher in the case of nationals form the former Yugoslav Republic
of Macedonia (85%).
Albanian applicants differed the most in
terms of their preferred Member States and
Schengen Associated Countries. While the
UK was the number one choice with 23%
share, Germany and Sweden were also targeted in very similar numbers (22.7% and
21%, respectively).
Seasonality and peaks
Similar to 2010, 2011 and 2012 developments,
the peak was reached during the last quarter of 2013. However, it was much more
sustained as it lasted from September to
mid-December 2013. During this four month
period alone, half of all asylum applications
were submitted.
According to German authorities, this clear
seasonality is largely explained by the fact
that Germany is not executing forced returns
during winter times due to possible adverse
effects of cold weather on returnees given
that their housing situation in their home
country is usually not adequate.

4.2.2. New developments
Increase of exit and entry refusals
All Western Balkan countries took additional
measures at their borders in order to prevent
possible abuses of visa-free travel arrangements. In Serbia and the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia for example, the authorities refused more than 13 000 of their
own citizens from exiting the country. Most
were refused exit because they were not
able to justify the purpose of their travel or
were previously deported from EU/Schengen countries.
These additional steps were taken by the
Western Balkan authorities as part of the
overall package of measures to reduce the
abuse of visa-free travel arrangements.
On the other hand, during 2013 Member
States and Schengen Associated Countries
refused entry to 17% more nationals from
the ﬁve visa-exempt countries compared to
2012. More than 85% of all refusals were issued by only ﬁve neighbouring or regional
Member States: Greece, Hungary, Slovenia,
Croatia and Italy.
Figure 32. Monthly comparison also points to a remarkable
similarities between the number of asylum applications submitted
during March–September of 2012 and 2013 periods

Given these incentives, many persons from
the ﬁve visa-exempt Western Balkans countries are believed to be returning asylum
seekers, travelling to Germany in the autumn, returning to their country of origin in
spring and repeating the same process next
autumn.

Hungary in particular stood out in terms of
increasing number of refusals of entry. This
Member State refused entry to roughly 7 150
nationals from the ﬁve visa-exempt countries, 70% more compared to 2012. More precisely, the increasing trend was largely linked
to reasons broadly associated with possible
abuse of visa-free status.
As stated earlier, these combined measures
taken by both Member States and Western
Balkan countries at their common borders
probably helped to prevent even larger visafree travel abuse associated with asylum
applications.
Illegal stay*
Combined, nationals from the Western Balkans amounted to 11% (or 38 300) of the total EU detections for illegal stay during 2013.
The share was thus identical to the situation during 2012.
Overall, there were 5% more detections of illegal stay for persons coming from Western
Balkan countries and territories compared to
2012. This is somewhat different to the overall trend in detections of illegal stay in the EU
and Schengen Associated Countries where
numbers have remained at the 2012 levels.

Importantly, the mentioned 5% overall increase in the number of detected illegal stayers from the Western Balkans is associated
with nationals of Albania whose numbers
rose to more than 16 000 and those coming from Kosovo** (+61% or 6 246). Other four
nationalities were detected in lower numbers ranging from 19% decrease in the case of
Bosnia and Herzegovina to 16% in the case of
the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
Albanians and persons from Kosovo** increased their absolute share of the regional
total to 58%, up from 47% share during 2012. In
practice, this means that six out of ten illegal
stayers from the Western Balkans detected
by Member States or Schengen Associated
Countries during 2013 were either from Albania or Kosovo.**

Greece and Germany remained the top reporting Member States for the second year
in a row. In Greece, detections were almost
exclusively linked to Albanian nationals and
mostly linked to a well-documented phenomenon of circular labour migration of Albanians to Greece.

In Germany, all Western Balkan nationalities
were detected in substantial numbers with
nationals of Serbia and persons from Kosovo*
accounting for almost two thirds of the total.
France, however, reported the single largest relative increase of 69% (from 2 066 to
3 451), largely due to nationals from Albania.
Hungary and Austria reported signiﬁcantly
more illegal stayers from Kosovo* (439% and
119%, respectively) while the UK continued
to detected increasing numbers of Albanians (42%).
In terms of diversity of destination choices,
Albanians remained unmatched compared
to other Western Balkan nationalities since
they were detected for illegal stay in practically all Member States and Schengen Associated Countries (30 in total).

Overall document fraud reported to the European Union Document-Fraud Risk Analysis Network (EDF) increased by 18% between
2012 and 2013. As during 2012, with roughly
3 200 detections, Albanians remained the
most commonly detected nationality of document fraudster despite 14% reduction in
detections compared to 2012. The reduction was largely due to a precipitous drop
in detected counterfeited Greek entry/exit
stamps (from more than 2 000 during 2012
to less than 800 during 2013).
Compared to other Western Balkan nationalities, Albanian nationals were by far the most
represented with a staggering 85% share of
the total.
Albanians were detected in nearly equal
numbers both on entry at the external borders of the EU and travelling between the
Schengen area and non-Schengen EU Member States (see Fig. 36); in the former example they were entering Greece at their land
border and in the latter case they were attempting to enter the UK from the Schengen area.
With almost 1 500 detections and 44% of the
total, Albanians were also by far the most
common nationality detected attempting to
enter the non-Schengen EU Member States
from the Schengen area, followed by migrants from Iran and Syria, with around 200
detections each.
For comparison, there were only 22 cases for
all other Western Balkan nationalities using
document fraud while travelling between
the Schengen area and non-Schengen EU
Member States.

From Schengen area to the UK
Albanians were mostly detected on entry at
Stansted, Gatwick and, to a lesser extent,
Heathrow airport in the UK, and on exit from
Bergamo and Malpensa airports in Italy. The
documents that Albanians were most commonly detected using on these journeys were
ID cards issued by Italy or Greece, together
accounting for more than two thirds of all
detections. The Italian ID cards were mostly
image substituted or stolen blank, while the
Greek ID cards were counterfeit or, to a lesser
extent, image substituted.

Figure 37. When travelling between the Schengen area and nonSchengen EU Member States (mostly between Italy and the UK),
Albanians were predominately using IDs from only two Member
States: Italy and Greece, but there were substantial differences
between the two in terms of fraud type

This preference for Italian and Greek IDs is

Document fraud in the Western Balkans:
WB-RAN perspective
Document fraud detections by the five
WB-RAN members during 2013 decreased by
21% compared to 2012. More precisely, there
were 332 detections of document reported
during 2013 compared to 420 during 2012. The
overall decreasing trend, however, hides significant divergence in terms of reporting country,
type of documents and the main nationalities.

Almost 45% of all detections of document
fraud (or 147 cases) in the Western Balkans region was reported by Serbia only, followed by
Albania and the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia (24% and 18% shares, respectively).
With 84% increase compared to 2013, detections in Serbia demonstrated by far the most
pronounced upward trend (+65%). It was
largely due to detections of Serbian nationals with counterfeited Swiss residence permits. In fact, detections of Serbian nationals
amounted to half of all detections for document fraud made by Serbia. More than one
third of all detections in Serbia were made
on exit towards Hungary.

Conversely, both nationals from Albania and
persons coming from the territory of Kosovo*
were detected in signiﬁcantly lower numbers compared to 2012. In the case of Albanians, the 57% drop was associated with a
decline in detections of counterfeited entry/
exit stamps while for persons from Kosovo*
decline in Swiss residence permits was driving the overall 40% drop compared to 2012.
Document type
Passports remained the most abused document type with almost half of the overall
share in 2013, despite a 26% decline compared
to 2012. ID cards on the other hand increased
by 121%, largely due detections of fraudulent

Most of passport abuse involved Albanian
travel documents (26), followed by those from
Bulgaria (18) and Turkey (13). In terms of passport fraudsters, most of them were coming
from the territory of Kosovo*, followed by
nationals of Serbia and Turkey. This was very
much similar compared to 2012.
There was a high degree of specialisation
associated with passport abuse, with most
nationalities tending to abuse their own national passports. The only notable exception to this rule were passport fraudsters
from the territory of Kosovo* who were de-

tected with a wide variety of passports form
the region itself (mostly Albanian) and several Member States and Schengen Associated Countries (Bulgaria, Slovenia, Greece,
the Czech Republic).

Detections of document fraud involving residence permits of different Member States
and Schengen Associated Countries were also
detected in fairly similar numbers as during
2012. There were 61 detection cases, involving mostly Swiss (32), Belgian (12), and Greek
(4) fraudulent residence permits. In fact, residence permits from these three Member
States and Schengen Associated Countries
amounted to 80% share of the total detections during 2013.

4.3. Risk of increased
smuggling of stolen
vehicles, drugs, and
weapons across the
common borders
4.3.1. Description of the threat
Information gathered from Member States
and Western Balkan countries through Frontex Joint Operations and open sources indicates that cross-border criminality, mainly
related to the trafficking in stolen vehicles
and the smuggling of illicit drugs and weapons, represents a signiﬁcant threat to border security at Western Balkan borders. In
particular assets deployed through the JO
Focal Points Land reported a continuously
high level of smuggling between the countries of the region.
Stolen vehicles on exit from the EU
The number of motor vehicles detected in
the context of Frontex Joint Operations at
Western Balkan borders declined from 127
in 2012 to 112 in 2013. More than half of these
cars were stopped at BCPs connecting Hungary and Croatia with Serbia. The majority
of detections were made at the Hungarian
BCP of Röszke and the Croatian BCP of Bajakovo. The third highest number of stolen
vehicles in 2013 was reported from the BCP
of Karasovići, which connects Croatia with
Montenegro. The risk at this short border
section shows to be particular large when
considering the fact that the ﬁgure only relates to the time after Croatia’s EU accession in July 2013.
The vehicles most frequently originated from
Italy (17%), Germany (13%), and Austria (7%).
Most drivers were of Serbian, Bulgarian and
Montenegrin nationality. More than half of
all detections of 2013 were made during the
summer months between June and September, when large numbers of migrant workers

44 of 58

and tourists travelled on the main highways
to and from the Western Balkans. The vehicle brand preferences did not change signiﬁcantly during the last years, as most cars
reported to Frontex from Western Balkan
borders were either manufactured by BMW
(24%), Volkswagen (20%), Mercedes (14%) or
Audi (9%).
Most car thefts were detected by comparing
the Vehicle Identiﬁcation Numbers (VIN) on
the engine, frame and other parts of the vehicle with information in the SIS II, INTERPOL
and national theft databases. Other cases
of theft were revealed because of false VIN
numbers or other speciﬁcations given in the
registration papers, pointing to either fraudulent documents or a VIN manipulation. Vehicles were also disassembled into parts to
obscure identiﬁcation or powers of attorney
containing an authorisation to travel abroad
were counterfeited. Through departure from
the EU with a leased, rental or very recently
stolen cars, criminals tried to avoid detections triggered by SIS II alerts.
The Western Balkans has, reportedly, not only
been a region of destination, but also of origin, and for transit on the way to Bulgaria
and Turkey. Frontex statistics from the Bulgarian and Greek borders to Turkey for 2013
show a high proportion of detected vehicles
stolen in Germany and Italy. To reach Turkey, persons driving these cars either took a
route through Romania or the Western Balkans, thus offering border authorities several
opportunities of detection.
Smuggling of illicit drugs
While cannabis is more and more produced
domestically within many Member States,
decreasing amounts of the substance are
trafficked across the EU common borders.
An exception appears to be herbal cannabis
trafficked from southeast Europe and particularly Albania to customers in countries

including Greece, Italy, Slovenia, and Hungary. Accordingly, 2013 was a year marked
by large scale seizures made by law-enforcement authorities in and around the Western
Balkans. In August, Albanian police in cooperation with Italian officials detected almost
a tonne of cannabis hidden on the Karaburun peninsula, ready to be trafficked to Italy.
In November, Greek anti-drug units seized
1.4 tonnes of cannabis arriving in a van from

Albania and arrested a Greek and an Albanian citizen. In 2013, seizures amounting to
164 kg of herbal cannabis were reported from
the Albanian-Greek border through Frontex
Joint Operations. In those cases, Albanian nationals attempted to smuggle the illicit goods
hidden in cavities of their vehicles.
By August 2013, the Italian Guardia di Finanza
concluded a major aerial surveillance operation to determine the amount of cannabis

Smuggling cannabis from Albania to Italy using speed
boats is growing
In 2013, Albanian authorities reported an increase in of cannabis seizures at their sea border compared to one year earlier (5 594 kg in 2013; 3 926 kg in 2012). Moreover, in ﬁrst three
months of 2014 already saw 2 950 kg of drugs conﬁscated.
Smuggling of drugs is increasing due to high proﬁts, much
higher than in case of illegal migrants smuggling and there
is no risk of loss of life at sea. Drugs might be easily stored
in caves or hidden near the coast for long period of time.
Usually speed boats, registered in Italy and Greece, and
jet skis were used to smuggled drugs, however one ﬁshing vessels was also noted in 2013. Speed boats’ drivers
were mostly Albanians aged 25–35 years.

which is produced by Albanian criminals. After an examination of 12.5% of the Albanian
territory, experts could identify the existence of 500 plantations, which according to
Italian estimates produce an annual 1 000
tonnes of herbal cannabis worth around EUR
4.5 billion. 319 hectares alone were identiﬁed
around the Albanian town of Lazarat near
the Greek border, which is essentially under
control of the local producers.

attempts were conducted by mostly EU nationals on the European Route E65 along the
coast from Montenegro through Bosnia and
Croatia to Slovenia. In 2013, seizures amounting to a total of almost half a tonne of cannabis were reported through Frontex Joint
Operations at Balkans borders.
Seizure and treatment numbers suggest that
heroin use in Europe has been decreasing during the last decade, while consumers often
replaced the substance with other, mostly
synthetic drugs. However, seizures show that

heroin is still smuggled along the traditional
routes into the EU and remains a considerable source of income for internationally operating organised crime groups. Most of the
heroin consumed in the EU is produced in Afghanistan and, to a lesser degree, in Iran and
Pakistan. It is transported along two major
routes into Europe: the Northern route, which
heads through Central Asia and the Russian
Federation, and the Balkan route, which runs
through Turkey and southeast Europe.
From Turkey, smuggled heroin usually enters the Balkans through the land borders of
Greece and Bulgaria. In a particularly significant incident on 1 August 2013, Turkish border authorities detected 717 kg of heroin at
the BCP Hamzabeili/Lesovo on a Croatianregistered truck driven by a Croatian citizen. The officers found the 1 400 packages
of heroin worth around EUR 13.5 million between dishwashers, washing machines and
LCD TVs. The truck that was loaded in Istanbul was on the way to Bosnia for a layover before further continuing its journey
to the EU. Similar but smaller seizures were
also made in Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Kosovo* and Serbia.

Smuggling of weapons
While data on individually smuggled weapons were only sporadically reported through
Frontex Joint Operations, information on
a number of large-scale cases was circulated through open sources. In December
2013, French police has disrupted a particularly large smuggling ring that trafficked several hundreds of guns, pistols, Kalashnikovs,
ammunition and spare parts mainly from
the Western Balkans to France. According to
media reports published in September 2013,
Croatian customs officials seized a number
of weapons including S-8 unguided aircraft
rockets, rocket launcher parts and solid rocket
fuel from a container at the Adriatic port of
Rijeka. According to media reports, the shipment originated from Serbia and was bound
for Abu Dhabi.
Authorities have been registering a steady
ﬂow of illicit small arms from Western Balkan
countries, where still a large number of weapons are stored in private households. During
the JO Focal Points Land, 15 ﬁre weapons and
around 1 300 pieces of ammunition were detected at BCPs of the region in 2013. Moreover,
112 truncheons, knifes, knuckle-dusters, electroshock weapons and pepper sprays have
been seized at the Balkan borders.

5. Outlook
Overall, borer security and irregular movements across regional and common borders are likely to remain governed by similar
factors as during 2013. No major change is
expected in this regard. Shifts between different border sections are likely response to
changing local circumstances (e.g. new border fences, increased operational activity).

* This designation is
without prejudice to
positions on status,
and is in line with
UNSCR 1244 and the

The growth of the Western Balkans as a source
region will likely be directly dependant on how
visa-free travel option evolves in the future, including negotiations on this matter with Kosovo.* Should visa obligation be temporarily
reintroduced for one or several Western Balkan countries, an increase in the number of illegal border-crossings (especially with regards to
Serbia or Albania) is a very likely consequence.

5.1. Evocation of the so-called
‘Visa safeguard clause’ by
Member States already in
2014
Visa suspension mechanism has been available to Member States since 9 January 2014.
Member States can now request the European Commission to temporarily suspend the
visa-free regime with a third country when
at least one of the criteria listed in Regulation 1289/2013 is met (see box).
The European Commission is aware of the
still worrying numbers of unfounded asylum
applications from citizens of some Western
Balkan countries in some Member States, in
particular in Germany. According to a simulation made by DG HOME in 2013, using data
for the last 6 months of 2009 and 2010, and
for the period April–September 2012 and 2013,
this is the situation concerning the ﬁve visafree Western Balkan countries:

48 of 58

Montenegro: the numbers are relatively low,
especially when compared with the other
countries in the region. However, Germany
and France have seen recent increases that
fulﬁl the criteria for requesting the triggering of the suspension.
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia: Germany could ask for the suspension if
a comparison is made with the situation in
2009. The same goes for France and Sweden. Germany has seen an increase of 41%
between 2012 and 2013, lower than the 50%
threshold but still substantial as it comes
from an already high level. In the case of
France and Sweden there have been decreases between 2012 and 2013 but the situation is still worrying. The Netherlands has
big increases in percentage points but numbers are low.
Serbia: Germany could trigger using both
comparison periods and the numbers are
signiﬁcant. Sweden could trigger but only
when comparing to 2009. The Netherlands
could trigger in theory but numbers are low.
Same goes for Luxembourg, if a comparison
is made with 2009.
Albania: Germany could trigger using both
comparison periods, although the recognition
rate is much higher than in the case of other
four visa-free nationalities (almost 6% compared to below 1%). France could also trigger, with the recognition rate of 3.4%, using
both comparison periods. Sweden could use
only the 2010 comparison period. Overall the
recognition rate at the EU level for Albanians
is relatively high: 14.2%.
Bosnia and Herzegovina: Germany could
trigger using both comparison periods, France

using the 2010 period (but 13% recognition
rate would be a problem), Luxemburg and
Sweden using the 2010 period.

Criteria from Regulation 1289/2013
Article 1a

5.2. Possible bypassing of the
Western Balkans
Black Sea route
Following almost 4 000 detections of illegal border-crossing in October 2013, the
Bulgarian authorities launched an extensive
operation at their land border with Turkey,
deploying signiﬁcant additional staff (police
and border police officers), enough to virtually seal the border with Turkey.
These changes in operational environment
at land borders of Turkey with the EU were
possibly linked to reports of four cases involving 118 persons who managed to illegally
enter territorial waters of Romania after departing from the Turkish Black Sea coast. In
addition to these ﬁgures, Turkish authorities
managed to stop 214 persons, mostly Afghans,
Syrians and Eritreans from departing in two
separate incidents.
In the overall scheme of things, the 332 persons detected on this route during 2013 are
dwarfed by almost 31 500 cases of illegal border-crossing detected by the Bulgarian, Greek
and Turkish authorities at their common land
and maritime (Aegean Sea only) borders.
However, the six cases clearly indicate that
facilitation networks in Turkey are actively
diversifying their services in response to operational measures taken by different authorities. It is also reasonable to assume that the
networks operating on the Black Sea coast
are probably still in a testing phase of their
operations. This is largely due to the following mitigating factors:
1. Weather and sea conditions in the western part of the Black Sea are generally

...’ A Member State may notify the Commission if it is confronted, over a six-month period, in comparison with the
same period in the previous year or with the last six months
prior to the implementation of the exemption from the visa
requirement for nationals of a third country listed in Annex
II, with one or more of the following circumstances leading to an emergency situation which it is unable to remedy on its own, namely a substantial and sudden increase
in the number of:
(a) nationals of that third country found to be staying in the
Member State’s territory without a right thereto;
(b) asylum applications from the nationals of that third country for which the recognition rate is low, where such an increase is leading to speciﬁc pressures on the Member State’s
asylum system;
(c) rejected readmission applications submitted by the Member State to that third country for its own nationals.
The comparison with the six-month period prior to the implementation of the exemption from the visa requirement
as referred to in the ﬁrst subparagraph shall only be applicable during a period of seven years from the date of
implementation of the exemption from the visa requirement for nationals of that third country.’

described by the Turkish Coast Guard as
rough (high waves and strong winds).
Travelling on small wooden ﬁshing boats
can therefore be very dangerous and can,
according to the Turkish Coast Guard, easily turn into ‘search and rescue’ situations.
2. The Black Sea costal area north-west
and east of Istanbul is sparsely populated, quite forested (difficult access to
the coast) and its ports/harbours are few
and far apart.

49 of 58

3. The Turkish authorities are actively trying to prevent unauthorised departures
from their Black Sea shore. The element
of surprise is therefore no longer beneﬁting Turkish facilitators.
4. Turkey also put ten new patrol vessels,
co-funded by the EU, in operational use in
mid-February 2014. One of the ten boats
is be deployed to the Black Sea. If need be
more can follow (especially for ’search and
rescue’ purposes).
5. Prices for a two-day crossing are relatively
high given that the migrants still have to
ﬁnance their onward journey from Romania towards western or northern Member States.
6. While initial cases were largely driven by
false expectations and rumours about application of Dublin II returns to Romania,
it should now be clear that migrants gain
little by crossing the Black Sea with regard
to their ultimate migration destination.
7. The likelihood of migrants disembarking without being detected by Romanian
maritime surveillance systems seems to
be fairly low.
Should some of these limiting factors change,
Black Sea route could become a more popular choice in the future, taking some of
the pressure away from the traditional land
route through the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Serbia towards Hungary.
Turkey becoming major destination
country for migrants
Turkish economy is experiencing a dramatic
transformation. In 2003, according to Eurostat, Turkey’s per capita GDP was 36% of
the EU average; by 2012, this had increased

Coast Guard that came into service in 2014
and was co-funded by the EU

to 54%. Following this economic boom in
Turkey, the country is becoming an increasingly attractive ﬁnal destination for irregular migrants.
In response to these developments and as
a part of a broader overhaul of Turkish immigration system, Turkey adopted a new
law that for the ﬁrst time addresses the issue of asylum into Turkey as well as irregular migration and trafficking. It also created
a new administrative body to deal with migration in general including visas, residence
and work permits bringing Turkey’s regime
into much greater alignment with the EU acquis in this area.
Turkey and the EU also signed readmission
agreement in late 2013. The agreement, applies to citizens of both parties as well as ‘to
third-country nationals who enter either the
EU or Turkey via the other’. The obligation to
readmit nationals from third countries with
which Turkey has not concluded bilateral
arrangements would come into force only
three years later. The agreement still has to
be formally ratiﬁed by both parties and will
take effect two months after this step has
been completed.

lice arrested 40 persons, all Italian nationals,
for alleged involvement of smuggling of cigarettes from Montenegro to Italy.

The so-called speed boat moratorium, a law
which prevented Albanian citizens from possessing speed boats of a certain size, came
to an end in March 2013, seven years after it
was ﬁrst introduced to counter drug, cigarettes and people smuggling from Albania
towards Italy.

While the use of speed boats for cannabis
smuggling is likely to grow as a threat, Albanian Border Police clearly stated that reactivation of human smuggling across the
sea from Albania to Italy is not very likely
at this stage. Albania will also continue to
treat these issues as a priority and will also
increase already efficient international cooperation in this regard.

The abolition of the moratorium was mostly
welcomed by costal tourist centres in Albania that expect a major positive impact of
the measure on local economies.
However, according to open-source information, in July 2013, the Italian Finance Police of Bari and Lecce intercepted a tonne of
cannabis that had been smuggled in to the
coast of Puglia on a speedboat. The police arrested two Italian and two Albanian citizens.
Likewise, during September 2013, Italian po-

Furthermore, Montenegrin authorities have
stated that there is no link between drug/
cigarette smugglers and people smugglers.
Nevertheless, this possibility should not be
excluded in the future, in particular should
there be major operational responses at other
border sections in the Western Balkans (displacement of the ﬂow).
