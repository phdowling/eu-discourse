Frontex official publications fall into four main categories: risk analysis, training, operations
and research, each marked with a distinct graphic identifier. Risk analysis publications
bear a triangular symbol formed by an arrow drawing a triangle, with a dot at the centre.
Metaphorically, the arrow represents the cyclical nature of risk analysis processes and its
orientation towards an appropriate operational response. The triangle is a symbol of ideal
proportions and knowledge, reflecting the pursuit of factual exactness, truth and exhaustive
analysis. The dot at the centre represents the intelligence factor and the focal point where
information from diverse sources converges to be processed, systematised and shared as
analytical products. Thus, Frontex risk analysis is meant to be at the centre and to form
a reliable basis for its operational activities.

Executive summary
In the first quarter of 2014 all of the indicators
of irregular migration and asylum, except the
number of detected facilitators, decreased
in comparison with the last quarter of 2013.
This general trend was in line with the annually recurring cycle of seasonal variation,
whereby the first months of each year are
usually marked by reduced pressure at the
external borders.
However, the decrease in the number of illegal border-crossings was not as substantial as what would usually be expected from
the seasonal fluctuations at this time of the
year. In fact, the past winter season showed
a massive influx of irregular migration at the
external border of the EU. Concretely, Q1 2014
was marked by the highest number of illegal border-crossings of any first quarter since
the initial stages of the Arab Spring in 2011.
Most irregular migrants were reported from
the sea border of the EU. Compared to one
year ago, Italy reported a sevenfold increase
in illegal border-crossings while numbers
in Greece more than doubled. Detections
reported from the Italian sea border represented almost 50% of all detected illegal
border-crossings in Q1 2014. For the first of
any quarter since FRAN data collection began, Malians were the most reported nationality at this part of the maritime border,
followed by Eritreans and Syrians.
By the end of Q1 2014, several indicators
pointed to a quick resumption of migratory movements across the Italian sea border after the seasonal decline of the winter
months. What was remarkable was the speed
at which migration appeared to regain momentum. Already in March, the number of
arrivals in Italy and Malta seemed to reach

the exceptionally high levels of the summer
of 2013. In the context of Frontex JO Hermes
2013, almost 5 000 irregular migrants were
apprehended during the third week of March.
Second, an analysis of the different waves of
migrant boats that have been targeting the
Italian sea border since November 2013 suggests a development of the logistical and organisational capacity of the criminal groups
that are facilitating the gathering and embarkation of migrants along the Libyan coast.
In addition to the large numbers of Syrians
that have been regularly detected in the Eastern Mediterranean region since the outbreak
of hostilities in Syria, numerous migrants
from this country have started to reach Europe from Northern Africa. In Q1 2014, close
to one third of Syrians were detected on the
Central Mediterranean route.
Increased operational activity in the Eastern
Mediterranean region led to a decrease in detections of illegal border-crossing. Since the
Bulgarian authorities started a special police
operation at their border with Turkey migratory movements originally displaced by the
Greek Operation Aspida from the Greek to
the Bulgarian border declined substantially.
The fact that the overall number of illegal border-crossings on the Eastern Mediterranean
route was still higher than one year ago can
be attributed to detections that were made
in the Aegean Sea.
The most illegal border-crossings at a land
border section in Q1 2014 were reported by
Hungary. Although the number of detections at the Hungarian-Serbian border has
remained stable since Q4 2013, a significant
increase was reported compared with the
corresponding quarter of the previous year.

Frontex · FRAN Quarterly · q1 2014

Afghans remained the most reported nationality at this border section, followed by
Syrians. These detections point to sustained
secondary movements from Greece through
the Western Balkan region to Hungary and
further on to other EU Member States, in spite
of increased operational activities at the EU
external borders with Turkey.
The land border with the strongest increase of
illegal border-crossings, compared to both the
last quarter and the situation one year ago,
was around the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta
and Melilla. As a result of a number of attempts to cross these borders, three times
as many persons as in Q1 2013 were able to
enter protecting the enclaves. While those
with sufficient funds used the services of facilitators to reach Spain as clandestine migrants hidden in motor vehicles, the majority
of individuals willing to reach Spanish territory opted to simply climb the fences, frequently in large groups.
The attempted breaches of the borders to
the Spanish enclaves were part of a general
trend of a shift from the sea to the land border on the Western Mediterranean route.
One of the reasons for this change may be
the strengthened surveillance at sea.
Of all FRAN indicators, the number of asylum applications showed the most regular
long-term upward trend. Although this indicator has been marked by a clear decline at
the beginning of each year, the annual total
asylum numbers increased by almost a fifth
every year since 2010. Simultaneously, asylum seekers increasingly focus on the top
destination countries. Since 2010, the proportion of applications for international protection submitted in Germany and Sweden
grew from around a third to one half of the
total number reported to FRAN.

6 of 52

In Bulgaria, asylum applications decreased
by approximately a third after peaking in Q4
2013. This decrease coincided with a drop in
detections of illegal border-crossing at the
land border between Bulgaria and Turkey.
In other Member States, asylum applications
remained fairly stable.
Syrians submitted a fifth of all applications
for international protection, being the number one nationality for the third quarter in
a row. Syrians did not follow the same seasonal pattern as other nationalities, which
showed a substantial decline in applications
during the winter season. Since the beginning of the war in Syria, a rather insignificant
drop in applications during the winter was
normally followed by a larger increase during the following summer months, with the
respective curve resembling more upward
stairs rather than the usual waves. Around
three quarters of Syrian asylum seekers submitted their application in the top asylum
countries Germany, Sweden, Bulgaria and
the Netherlands.
Compared to the same period in 2013, document fraud decreased in Q1 2014 in terms
of detections from third countries on entry
to the EU and Schengen area. Spain, Italy,
France and Greece together accounted for
more than half of all cases at the EU level.
The long-term upward trend in Spain continued also in Q1 2014, when the country reported more detections than ever, mainly at
Madrid airport or Ceuta and Melilla.
The political crisis and armed conflict in
Ukraine did not show any larger effect on the
reported cases of document fraud. Ukrainians
that were detected entering the EU/Schengen area with fraudulent travel documents
generally followed the overall seasonal trend,
although the number decreased at a slower
pace in Q1 2014.

1. Introduction
FRAN Quarterly reports are prepared by the
Frontex Risk Analysis Unit and provide a regular overview of irregular migration at the
EU external borders, based on the irregularmigration data exchanged among Member
State border-control authorities within the
cooperative framework of the Frontex Risk
Analysis Network (FRAN) and its subsidiary,
the European Union Document-Fraud Risk
Analysis Network (EDF-RAN).
The main purpose of the FRAN Quarterlies
is to provide:
1.	feedback to the FRAN community in the
context of information exchange;
2.	a periodic update to the situational picture of irregular migration at the EU level;
and
3.	material for constructive discussion on reporting protocols and related trends and
patterns.
This report is intended to simultaneously
serve two objectives: first, to provide a clear
summary of the situation at the external border of the EU, and second, to serve as an archive for future reference and comparative

analyses. Consistent with standard archival
techniques, some information is repeated in
different sections to serve as context.
Harmonising complex, multi-source migration data among Frontex and Member States
is an ongoing process. Therefore, some of
the more detailed data and trends in this report should be interpreted with caution and,
where possible, cross-referenced with information from other sources.
FRAN members and Member State risk analysis experts and border-control authorities are
considered the primary customers of these
reports. In addition to the discussions taking
place during FRAN meetings, Member State
experts are invited and encouraged to examine and comment upon the data and analyses presented here. Despite all efforts of the
Frontex Risk Analysis Unit and Member State
experts involved in data exchange and analyses, it is conceivable that minor errors may
occur in these reports due to very challenging timelines and the growing volume and
complexity of the data and other information exchanged within the FRAN community.

2. Methodology
This, the 23rd issue of the FRAN Quarterly,
is a comparative analysis of FRAN data collected between January and March 2014 and
exchanged between 31 Member State bordercontrol authorities within the framework of
the FRAN. The report presents the results of
statistical analysis of quarterly variations in
eight irregular-migration indicators and one
asylum indicator, aggregated at the level of
the event. Bi-monthly analytical reports exchanged by Member States were also used
for interpretative purposes and to provide
qualitative information, as were other available sources of information, such as Frontex
Joint Operations.
Precise definitions of Indicators 1 to 6, aimed
at harmonising the data exchanged at EU
level, were presented in the annexes of the
Q1 and Q2 reports in 2009 and so are not
repeated here.
During the June 2010 FRAN meeting, a proposal for a harmonised definition of the return
indicator was outlined and several questions
were raised in order to motivate discussion

Monthly data on the following indicators were exchanged
among the FRAN community:
1A detections of illegal border-crossing between BCPs
1B detections of illegal border-crossing at BCPs
2 detections of suspected facilitators
3 detections of illegal stay
4 refusals of entry
5 asylum applications
6 document fraud (EDF-RAN)
7A return decisions for illegally staying third-country nationals
7B	effective returns of illegally staying third-country nationals
FRAN and EDF-RAN data used in the tables are as of 21 May 2014

8 of 52

among FRAN members in view of establishing the regular collection of monthly return data by Frontex. Subsequently, an online
survey of FRAN members was conducted to
gather information and further motivate discussion to fine-tune the proposal for the indicator. The 11th FRAN report (Q1 2011) was
the first to include analysis of Indicators 7A
and 7B, and the definitions of these indicators are included in an annex to that report.
Data collection commenced in January 2011.
The FRAN data-exchange has been in place
since September 2007. Data are exchanged
through the ICONet Internet platform, an
interest group of the European Commission’s CIRCA server. Member State monthly
data are based on a country template prepared by the Frontex Risk Analysis Unit.
The deadline for submitting data for each
month is the 25th day of the subsequent
month, with the exception of the end of
year data, which are requested by 15 January each year. For this 23rd issue of the FRAN
Quarterly, the target for Member States to
upload the monthly data was thus 25 April
2014. In principle, data submitted subsequent to this date will be reflected in the
next FRAN Quarterly, except in cases where
clarification is needed in order to proceed
with comprehensive analysis.
Following the closure of the CIREFI working
group in April 2010, most of its mandates
and, of particular relevance, the exchange
of data were transferred to FRAN. Fortunately, most CIREFI indicators already overlapped with the monthly data exchange of
FRAN members. The exception was the indicator on returns, which was added as part
of the regular data exchange within FRAN at
the beginning of 2011.

In January 2012, the European Union Document-Fraud Risk Analysis Network (EDFRAN) was formed as a specialist forum to
oversee the exchange and analyses of detections of document fraud to illegally cross
the external borders and on all international
flights. Data were backdated and joined with
those exchanged under a pilot Tailored Risk
Analysis released in 2011.*
External borders refer to the borders between Member States and third countries.
The borders between the Schengen Associated Countries (Liechtenstein, Norway, Iceland and Switzerland) and third countries
are also considered as external borders. The
borders between the Schengen Associated
Countries and Schengen Member States are
considered as internal borders. For the indicators on detections of facilitators, illegal
stay and asylum, statistics are also reported
for detections at the land borders between
the Schengen Member States and Schengen candidates (Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania)
or non-Schengen Member States (the UK
and Ireland), so that a total for EU Member
States and Schengen Associated Countries as
a whole can be presented. It was not possible to make this distinction for air and sea
borders because Member States do not habitually differentiate between extra-EU and
intra-EU air and sea connections but tend to
aggregate data for all arrivals.
When data are examined at the level of thirdcountry nationalities, a large percentage
usually falls under the category ‘Other (not
specified)’ or ‘Unknown’. It is expected that
the percentage reported under these categories will decrease with time as Member
States improve the quality and speed of their
identification, data collection and reporting
practices; nationalities are often reported as

‘Unknown’ if an individual’s nationality cannot
be established before reports are submitted.
This issue of the FRAN Quarterly also includes
the main findings of Frontex-coordinated
Joint Operations active for at least a proportion of Q1 2014. Namely, for sea borders, they
were JO Poseidon Sea 2013, JO EPN Hermes
2013 and JO EPN Aeneas 2013; for land borders – JO Poseidon Land 2013, JO Poseidon
Land 2014 and JO Focal Points Land 2013; for
the air border – JO Focal Points Air 2013 and
JO Focal Points Air 2014; and the return-related Project Attica 2013.

2009–2010, Ref. R063/2011

Both primary data source, such as interviews
with irregular migrants, and secondary data
source, such as reports of intelligence analysts, daily reports of deployed officers and
analytical products (weekly and bi-weekly
analytical reports for each abovementioned
operation) were used to provide an exhaustive overview of the situation at the external
borders of the EU. Additionally, open-source
data were researched as background information for the present analysis.

Acknowledgments
The Frontex Risk Analysis Unit would like
to express its gratitude to all FRAN and
EDF-RAN members and their associates in
Member State statistical, migration and document-fraud units who collect, aggregate
and exchange monthly data, also to the analysts who compile the bi-monthly analytical reports, on which much of the detailed
analyses presented here are based.
We are also grateful to Member State representatives who responded to requests for
additional information on key topics and
emerging trends.

4. Situational picture in Q1 2014
4.1. Detections of illegal
border-crossing

with the second largest number of illegal
border-crossings.

FRAN data in the first quarter of 2014 show
a substantial decrease in detections of illegal
border-crossing at the EU external borders
compared to Q4 2013. Although the number
of 22 498 persons detected between January and March reaches only half of the level
reported in Q3 2013, the past winter season
showed the largest influx of irregular migration at the external border of the EU since
the initial stages of the Arab Spring in 2011.

The Greek land border with Turkey was, for
many years, the main entry point of irregular
migration until the launch of the Greek operation Aspida in August 2012. In the course of
this operation additional officers and equipment was deployed to the Evros region, reducing the number of apprehended migrants.
In November 2013, the Bulgarian authorities
decided to launch a similar operation in order to counter migratory displacement effects
from the Greek section of the Turkish border. This, in combination with a surveillance
system and a fence, led to a decrease of detections of 90% since Q4 2013, the majority
being Syrian nationals. On the other hand,
in the eastern Aegean Sea detections did
not decrease during the first quarter of 2014.

Most detections of illegal border-crossing
were at the sea borders of the EU, where
nearly 15 000 irregular migrants were reported by Member States. Detections
reported from the Italian blue border represented almost 50% of all detections of illegal border-crossing. For the first time in any
quarter since FRAN data collection began in
2008, Malian nationals were the most represented nationality at this part of the maritime
border. In January and February, Eritreans
were detected in far lower numbers than
during the previous months, but in March
2014 Italy reported more than 1 000 detections. Syrians reached an all-time high for this
time of the year, with more than 1 300 arriving in boats, mainly to Sicily. As in Q4 2013,
around 1 200 Gambians were detected trying
to reach Europe in rubber or wooden boats.
At the Bulgarian and Greek borders with
Turkey, the situation has remained rather
stable during the last six months. However,
with more than 3 600 detections in Q1 2014,
the number of illegal border-crossings has
been at the highest level of any previous first
quarter since 2011. During the second half of
2013, Greece remained the Member State

The number of illegal border-crossings in
Hungary decreased from its peak in Q2 2013
and stabilised between in Q4 2013 and Q1
2014. Still, with a third of all detections at
EU land border sections, the border between
Hungary and Serbia was the one from where
the most illegal border-crossings were reported. Most migrants detected here were
from Afghanistan and, to a lesser extent,
Syria and Kosovo.*
The land border with the strongest increase
of illegal border-crossings, was around the
Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla. As a
result of a number of attempts to cross the
Spanish land border with Morocco, a large
number of migrants, mainly sub-Saharan Africans, were able to cross the fence to Melilla. While those with sufficient funds used
the services of facilitators to reach Spain as
clandestine migrants hidden in motor vehi-

cles, the majority opted to simply climb the
fences, frequently in large groups.
Figure 2 shows the evolution of FRAN Indicator 1A – detections of illegal border-crossing and the proportion of detections at the
land and sea borders of the EU per quarter since the beginning of 2008. This figure
clearly illustrates the rather usual seasonal
decrease that was registered during the last
six months. However, what is remarkable in
this context is the particularly high proportion of detections at the sea borders during
the quarter typically marked by the winter season.
Figure 3 illustrates the level of detections of
illegal border-crossing during Q1 2013 and Q1
2014 (size of circles) and the degree of change
between these reporting periods (slopes) for
the top ten Member States. In Q1 2014, of
the Member States that are subject to illegal
border–crossings, most reported increased
detections compared to the same period in
2013. The biggest increase was reported by
Italy where detections rose by over 600%,
followed by Spain with an increase of nearly

12 of 52

130%, Romania with 70% and Greece where
detections rose by two thirds. Only in Bulgaria were significant decreases reported
compared to the same period in 2013. Each
of these increases is dealt with in more detail
in the relevant parts of Section 4.2. Routes.
Apart from analysing the changes in terms
of Member State distributions, it is also informative to consider these trends by nationality of the detected migrants at the EU
level. Figure 4 illustrates the number of detections of illegal border-crossing of the top
ten nationalities during the first quarters of
2013 and 2014 (size of circles) and the degree
of change between these reporting periods
(slopes). This clearly shows that detections
of Eritreans increased the most (by around
fourteen times) in relative terms among all
nationalities compared to the same period in
2013, followed by Malians and Gambians, but
on different levels. In absolute numbers, the
number of Syrians detected for illegal border-crossing increased the most (by 3 385
persons). It should be however noted in this
context that reports on migrants claiming
to be from Syria suggest nationality swap-

ping has become relatively common. Migrants from other countries are claiming to
be for example Syria in order to increase their
chances of being granted international protection or at least to inhibit return procedures. Although migrants claiming to be from
Afghanistan were detected illegally crossing
the external border less frequently during the
last two years, in Q1 2014, they were again reported in higher numbers than one year ago.

4.2. Routes
For more detailed analyses, detections of illegal border-crossing are frequently classified
into major irregular migration routes, more
accurately relating to regions of detection
rather than linear routes taken. As illustrated
in Figure 5, during the first quarter of 2014,
detections of illegal border-crossing in the
Central Mediterranean ranked first among
the main irregular migration routes, following
an almost tenfold increase compared to Q1
2013. In the Eastern Mediterranean, Member
States reported a twofold increase compared

14 of 52

to the same time in 2013. For all sea borders,
the usual seasonal decrease in Q1 2014 has
been less significant than in previous years.
4.2.1. Central Mediterranean route
In total, 10 799 migrants have been detected
at the Central Mediterranean route in Q1
2014. As usual, the number of detections has
been lower due to the maritime weather conditions of the winter season. Nevertheless
irregular migration in the Central Mediterranean has been at the highest level since Q1
2011, when the migratory flows, particularly
from Tunisia, had been exceptionally large
following the upheaval in the Arab world.
While in 2011, migrants coming from Tunisia primarily arrived at the coastal areas of
Lampedusa, in 2014 most migrants departed
from Libya trying to reach the Sicilian coast.
The speed at which migration appeared to
regain momentum with the end of the winter season is remarkable. Already in March
2014, the number of arrivals in Italy and Malta

According to FRAN data, the number of Malian nationals apprehended in the Central
Mediterranean, has increased by more than
1 000 persons since the previous quarter to
1 753, thus ranking first among all migrant
nationalities on this route in Q1 2014. The
second and third ranking nationalities were
Eritreans and Syrians with 1 522 and 1 268
detections respectively. Their increase was
enormous compared to Q1 2013, when only
3 and 85 persons of these nationalities were
reported on the Central Mediterranean route.
By the second half of 2013 Syrians started
to leave Egypt in massive numbers. Before
October they were arriving in Italy directly
from Egypt; from September on, they were
more frequently detected in boats that had
departed from Libya.

Reports show that some refugees escaped
the conflict in Syria by travelling overland
to Beirut, Lebanon, from where they took
flights to Tripoli. In Libya, they used the services offered by facilitators to board boats to
cross the Mediterranean Sea. In these specific cases, their arrival in Italy took place only
three to five days after the departure from
Syria. In other cases, Syrians travelled overland across Jordan and Egypt and stayed in
Libya for longer periods of up to more than a
year. They contacted facilitators only for the
last leg of their journey to Europe.

seemed to have reached the exceptionally
high levels of summer 2013. In the context of
Frontex JO Hermes 2013, almost 5 000 irregular migrants were apprehended alone during
the third week of March. Almost 50% of all
detected migrants who departed from Libya
in Q1 2014 arrived during these seven days.

Operation “Mare Nostrum”
Italy has been strengthening its maritime presence in the
southern Mediterranean through a specific operation named
Mare Nostrum (Our Sea) since 18 October 2013. It aims at
controlling migrant flows through increased surveillance
and search-and-rescue (SAR) activities. Under Mare Nostrum, the Italian Navy deploys a number of ships and other
assets to the waters of the Sicily Channel between Italy and
Libya. In December 2013, Slovenia contributed the military
vessel ‘Triglav’ to the operation. The assets were deployed
to save lives at sea and to intercept and transport migrants detected in the Mediterranean Sea to Sicily.
Central to the operation is the effective co-ordination and integration of assets and data coming from
the different agencies.

Information from JO Hermes shows that in
Q1 2014 not only Syrians but the clear majority of all other migrants that arrived by the
Central Mediterranean route had departed
from Libya. Only around 5% have left from
Egypt, Tunisia or Turkey.
Another exceptional increase was related to
Gambian nationals, the detections of which
have grown nearly fourfold last year to more
than 1 200 in Q1 2014. According to reports,
many of these migrants decided to leave the
Gambia to go to other countries of the region for economic reasons. As the living conditions for migrants are difficult there and
job opportunities are scarce, they consider
moving on to Libya. The unstable security
situation in Libya and the power of the facilitation networks give them the final impulse to travel to Europe.
Similarly, migrants from Bangladesh, Pakistan
and India intended to seek jobs in Libya, but
frequent attacks and robberies forced them
to leave and go to Europe.

In contrast, the initial intention of Somalis after leaving their country was reaching
Europe rather than finding a job in another
African country. Most of the irregular Somali
migrants who arrived in Italy were between
20 and 25 year old men who were educated
and came from the middle class.
Interviewed Somalis and Eritreans said that
the facilitators provided them with no water or food and only around 30 litres of fuel
because, they would be rescued by Italian
authorities after two days at sea anyway.
Eritreans had to pay USD 20 if they wanted
to have a life jacket.
4.2.2. Apulia and Calabria
In the southern Italian regions of Apulia and
Calabria, detections of illegal border-crossing
tend to be associated with two different kinds
of irregular migration. The majority of detections in the area of Apulia are of secondary
movements to Italy of migrants who originally entered the Schengen area in Greece,
while most detections in Calabria are of migrants who departed from Turkey or Egypt
and sailed across the Aegean Sea, often near
Crete, towards Italy to enter the Schengen
area for the first time.
Although in the past seasonal fluctuations
have always been strong in this area, the
number of detections in Q1 2014 have been
the lowest since 2010. The most reported
nationality on this route was Egyptians, all
of whom departed directly from their home
country to reach Calabria. Also many Syrians, whose apprehension numbers remained
stable compared to one year ago, arrived in
Calabria, using the sea corridor from Egypt.
The sharpest decreases compared to last
year were of Pakistanis and Afghans, whose
apprehension numbers were 60-80% lower
than one year ago. Egypt was the top-ranking departure country for these migrants, fol-

The JO EPN Aeneas 2013 started on 3 June
and has recently been extended. According to overall detections during the operation, there has been a downward movement
since a peak in Q3 2013, when specifically
during September more incidents were reported than during any other month since
2010. In particular, the area of Apulia has
seen a drastic decrease since the beginning
of JO Aeneas 2013. This development shows
that the sea route between Greece and Italy has lost some significance compared to
the Western Balkan route.
4.2.3. Eastern Mediterranean route
Since the beginning of the FRAN data collection, the Eastern Mediterranean route has
been a major hotspot for irregular migration
into the EU, predominantly associated with
illegal border-crossings from Turkey. However, since early August 2012 at the Greek
land border and since November 2013 at the
Bulgarian border detections have been at
much lower levels following increased operational activity in these areas; In the Eastern
Aegean Sea, the number of detections were
twice as high as one year ago but stayed on
the same level as in Q4 2013. In total, in Q1
2014 there were 4 195 detections of illegal
border-crossing on the Eastern Mediterranean route, which was an increase of 53%
compared to the same period in 2013 but a
seasonal decrease of 55% compared to the
previous quarter.
The marked decrease in detections observed
since August 2012 is due to a range of operational activities taking place at different
border sections on the Eastern Mediterranean route:
1.	In August 2012 the Greek authorities
launched operation Aspida, deploying additional manpower, assets and equipment

339 irregular migrants rescued from an iron fishing
boat coming from Alexandria, Egypt
On 31 March 2014, an
iron fishing boat full of
migrants coming from
Alexandria, Egypt, triggered a major SAR operation involving HCG
assets, private vessels
and a US Navy vessel. Ten days before, a
group of 100 Syrians was transferred with the help of three
smaller boats from Alexandria’s Al-Mandarah area to a larger
wooden boat. They sailed for two hours and then they were
transferred again to an iron fishing boat (see picture) which
was waiting for them in the open seas. After two days of
sailing, they were approached by another wooden boat
with 150 persons, mainly Egyptians onboard and after another two days, a new group of approximately 100 Syrians
and Egyptian joined them. They sailed for four days heading
in the direction of Sicily, but due to the rough sea conditions
the vessel had engine problems. One of the migrants then
contacted the Italian authorities via mobile phone and requested assistance. The first response was made by a US
military vessel and a Greek cargo vessel, which took all
the migrants onboard and with the assistance of the
Hellenic Coast Guard, transferred them to the port
of Paleochora, Crete. There were (185 Egyptians and
154 Syrians) and 6 facilitators (all Egyptian nationals)
onboard the iron fishing vessel.

to the Evros region in order to tackle illegal migration. The operation has been extended until 30 June 2014. The enhanced
surveillance and patrolling activities have
resulted in a significant drop in the number
of apprehended irregular migrants in the
Evros region and have led to a displacement of the migration flow towards the
Bulgarian-Turkish border and the eastern
Aegean Sea. In addition to the operation
Aspida, the operation Xenios Zeus focused

on detecting migrants inland in urban areas around Athens.
2.	As a response to the increased pressure at
the Bulgarian-Turkish land border, the Bulgarian authorities decided to implement
an Integrated Border Surveillance System
(IBSS) and a specialised police operation,
to conduct enhanced air surveillance, and
to construct a 30-kilometre-long fence
along vulnerable parts of the border.
3.	JO Poseidon Land 2013 was also active during Q3 2013 at the land border with Turkey.
The operation ended on 26 March and on
the same day JO Poseidon Land 2014 was
commenced. From 1 January to 30 March
2014, a total of 635 irregular migrants were
reported for crossing the border illegally
(394 migrants in the Bulgarian operational
area and 241 migrants in the Greek operational area), which represents a decrease
compared to the same reporting period
of 2013, when 883 migrants were apprehended (731 migrants in Bulgaria and 152
migrants in Greece). Regular meetings between the Greek and Turkish authorities

18 of 52

2014

take place on a monthly basis with the exchange of relevant data and information.
4.	Moreover, JO Poseidon Sea 2013 was operational during the reporting period in
order to tackle the flow of irregular migrants at the external EU sea borders in
the Eastern Mediterranean mainly from
Turkey and, to a lesser extent, from Egypt.
As can be seen in Figure 8, the abovementioned operational activities led to a sustained long-term decrease in detections of
illegal border-crossing in the eastern Mediterranean region. The fact that the overall numbers of illegal border-crossing on the
eastern Mediterranean route was still higher
than one year ago can be attributed to the
detections in the Aegean Sea.
Eastern Aegean Sea
According to FRAN data from January to
March 2014, more than 3 000 apprehensions
of irregular migrants were reported from
the eastern Aegean Sea. During Q1 2014, the

number of migrants detected in this area has
been far higher than during the same season
in previous years. This trend can be attributed to the high number of Syrian migrants
who continued to enter Turkey and the increased surveillance and operational activity
at the EU common land borders with Turkey.
Several migrants apprehended on the Greek
eastern Aegean Islands stated that they had
made previous attempts to cross the border
from Turkey to Greece via the Evros River,
but because of the intense patrolling on the
Greek side of the border it was impossible
to cross over without being detected. Consequently facilitators offered them the sea
route as an alternative.
In regards to the location of interceptions,
roughly 80% were made inland on the Aegean islands and the rest at sea. In the 166
incidents detected through JO Poseidon Sea
2013 during Q1 2014, the most targeted islands have been Lesvos, Chios and Samos.
Bulgarian land border
As a response to the increased migration at
the Bulgarian-Turkish land border, the Bulgarian authorities decided to launch a combination of measures. Since 1 July 2012, the
Bulgarian authorities have implemented
an Integrated Border Surveillance System
(IBSS) at the border section between the
BCPs of Kapitan Andreevo and Lesovo, covering 58 km, and enhanced air surveillance has
been ongoing since October 2012. Through a
special police operation launched on 11 November 2013 additional police and border
police officers have been deployed to the
Bulgarian-Turkish land border.
The Bulgarian authorities also started the
construction of a fence in the border area
most affected by illegal migration. In addition
to these measures, regular bilateral meetings
between Bulgarian and Turkish authorities

take place under an agreement signed between Bulgaria and Turkey.
During Q4 2013, the highest level of detections
since the beginning of the FRAN data collection was reported at the Bulgarian land border to Turkey. Since then, as a consequence
of the abovementioned Bulgarian measures,
the level of detections decreased by 93%.
Migrants from Syria
As was the case in the previous quarter, in
Q1 2014 Syrians constituted more than half of
all detections on this route (2 617). While detections in the eastern Aegean Sea increased
by more than 15%, illegal border-crossing at
the land-border sections to Turkey decreased
by 86% since the previous quarter due to increased operational activity, coming down to
the similar levels of one year ago. However,
repeated apprehensions of irregular migrants
travelling clandestinely within Bulgaria and
Greece point to a substantial share of Syrians who had managed to cross the border
undetected.
4.2.4. Western Mediterranean route
In Q1 2014 there were over 2 500 detections
of illegal border-crossing in the western Mediterranean region, which consists of several
areas of the southern Spanish coast as well
as the land borders of Ceuta and Melilla. This
was roughly similar to the detections reported half a year ago in Q3 2013, and the
second largest total reported on this route,
the record being in Q3 2011, the year of the
Arab Spring.
On February 6 15 migrants drowned in Moroccan waters while trying to swim to Ceuta
from a nearby beach. The accident was widely
reported in the media as it coincided with an
increase of attempts to cross the fence by
large groups of migrants. From the beginning of the year till March 2014, the Spanish

authorities reported seven attempts made
by large groups of migrants. One of the largest incidents happened on 17 March, when
about 500 migrants from a group of more
than 1 100, succeeded in crossing the border to Melilla. The migrants attempted to
cross at night but were prevented by Moroccan and Spanish authorities. It was only
in the early morning, taking advantage of a
fog forming in a valley, that some succeeded
in reaching Spain.
These incidents are part of a general trend
of increasing detections at the land border, while detections at the sea border decreased. As can be seen in the chart above,
detections at the land border reached a peak
in Q1 2014. One of the reasons which might
help to explain this trend is the strengthening of surveillance at sea that would push
migrants to attempt crossing the fencedland border.
For several months, the Spanish authorities
had warned of an increasing number of migrants joining makeshift camps on the Mo-

20 of 52

roccan hills nearby Melilla. Most migrants
are sub-Saharan Africans.
4.2.5. Western African route
In the first quarter of 2014, few detections of
illegal border-crossing were reported from
this region. The level of detections is far lower
than during the peak of migration in Q1 of
2009, when close to 1 500 persons were
apprehended. The majority of the persons
detected during the reporting period were
Moroccan (24).
In spite of a minor peak detections in Q3 and
Q4 2013, irregular migration on the West African route is still at a much reduced rate compared the situation before 2010. Sustained
high levels of surveillance ensuring early detections and collaboration with third-country
authorities are the key to maintaining the low
levels of detections at the border.
4.2.6. Western Balkan route
Western Balkan countries and their neighbouring EU Member States reported more

than 6 00 detections of illegal border-crossing between BCPs. Importantly, the number
was 20% lower in relation to the previous
quarter and 15% lower than in the corresponding period of the previous year. This
lower number of was largely due to a 45%
decrease in detections made at the GreekAlbanian border compared with the previous
quarter. The drop is in line with the seasonal
changes in the circular migration of Albanian
citizens to Greece.
Detections at the Hungarian-Serbian border,
which remained the busiest in terms of detections of illegal border-crossing in the region, remained stable with a 3% slip compared
with the previous quarter and a 13% increase
compared with the corresponding quarter of
the previous year. As regards nationalities
detected at the Hungarian-Serbian border,
the number of Afghan nationals remained
the largest during the first quarter, followed
by Syrians. This suggests sustained secondary movements from Greece through Western Balkans regions to Hungary and further
on to other EU Member States. In fact, information collected in the context of Frontex
Joint Operations suggests that the Western
Balkan route is to some extent used instead
of the direct sea route from Greece to Italy,
mostly due to the lower costs of facilitation.
In contrast, the recently growing trend in
detections at the Bulgarian-Serbian border
have turned into a sharp decline, compared
to the previous quarter, which was mainly
due to fewer detections of Afghans and Syrians. This drop corresponds with decreased
detections of irregular migrants aiming to
cross illegally into Bulgaria.
As regards nationalities detected in the region as a whole, over half the detections
continued to be linked to migrants who had
most probably entered the Western Balkans
en route from Turkey to Greece or Bulgaria
(i.e. Afghans, Pakistanis, Syrians, Algerians,

Somalis and Eritreans). Albanians were the
top detected nationality with a 28% share
of total detections.
However, there were sharply diverging trends
as regards different nationalities. The level of
detected Afghan nationals remained stable
while the rise in detections of Syrian nationals continue, showing a 28% increase (1 096)
compared to the previous quarter (853).
In contrast, the number of detected Pakistani nationals continued to drop sharply (to
only 115 during the first quarter). There was
also a sharp decrease in the number of detected North African migrants. For example,
the number of detected Algerian nationals
dropped to only 6 compared with 559 in the
corresponding quarter of 2013 and 45 in the
previous quarter. The number of West African migrants continued to drop, too. For
example, the number of detected Nigerian
nationals fell from 101 to 24 and that of Senegal nationals from 96 to 6 between the final
quarter of 2013 and the first quarter of 2014.
The decreasing trend in detections of these
nationalities could partly be attributed to
changes in modus operandi or, to some extent, also to nationality swapping. However,
the decreasing trend corresponds closely
with a significantly low number of detections made at the borders with Turkey in
comparison with a much higher level of detections of Syrian, Afghan and Eritrean nationals, for example.
According to the Turkish authorities, the
number of detections of Pakistanis and Algerians also remained modest throughout
2013. It is, therefore, likely that the decrease in
the flow of these nationalities is, for the most
part, simply due to a decreased ‘pool’ of these
persons already living in Greece (or arriving
in Greece legally) and willing to move on.

4.2.7. Circular migration from Albania to
Greece
Prior to being granted visa free access to the
Schengen area in late 2010, Albanians were
regularly detected in very high numbers illegally crossing their land border into Greece.
Since visa liberalisation, Albanians are still detected illegally crossing the border into Greece
but at a much lower level, although numbers
began to increase again in 2013. Moreover,
there were increased numbers of reports of
refusals of entry (mostly for having an alert
in the SIS) and also document fraud (counterfeit border-crossing stamps to fabricate
travel histories and extend periods of stay in
the Schengen area).
In Q1 2014, detections of Albanians at the
Greek-Albanian border increased by 16% compared to the same quarter of 2013. Likewise,
detections of Albanians at the Greek border
with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia increased by 148% compared to the same
quarter of 2013, although from a low base.
Over the same period, refusals of entry of Albanians at these border sections have also
remained stable, even decreasing in Greece.
Effective returns of Albanians also decreased in
Q1 2014 compared to 2013, indicating that the
increase in illegal border-crossing observed in
2013 did not continue through 2014.
4.2.8. Eastern land borders route
The eastern land borders route is, in effect,
an amalgam of detections of illegal bordercrossing reported from the green borders of
Lithuania, Slovakia, Romania, Hungary, Poland, Estonia, Finland and Latvia. Despite the
length of all the border sections, detections
tend to be lower than on other routes possibly due to the long distances between major
hubs and countries of origin and often impassable terrain. Also according to several bimonthly analytical reports shared throughout

22 of 52

2013 and 2014, visa fraud and counterfeit border-crossing stamps tend to be predominant
on this route, as opposed to detections of illegal border-crossing (see Section 4.8 Document fraud).
In Q1 2014 there were 189 detections of illegal border-crossing between BCPs reported
at the eastern land borders of the EU, which
is slightly less than in the previous quarter
and in the same period in 2013.
Despite the decreasing general trend, there
were important variations considering different border sections. First, detections decreased at the borders with Belarus and the
Russian Federation. The drop may be explained by seasonal variations, but was also
due to a decreased flow of Georgian nationals detected at the Lithuanian-Belarusian
border, which was in line with a decreasing
number of refusals of entry issued to Georgian nationals. At the borders with the Russian Federation, the drop could be also partly
linked with enhanced security measures undertaken by the Russian authorities due to
the Sochi Olympic Games 2014.
In contrast, at the Member State borders
with Ukraine there were 104 detections compared with 61 in the corresponding period of
the last year. According to data gathered in
the context of the eastern European Borders
Risk Analysis Network (EB-RAN), the detections by Ukrainian authorities increased too.
However, it needs to be stressed that in the
case of Ukrainian nationals, with a total 26
detections at the Member State borders with
Ukraine, the purpose of illegal border-crossing was related to irregular migration in only
4 cases. By March the impact of the Ukrainian
crisis remained very limited in terms of illegal
border-crossings. Additionally, if indeed there
was a link to the growth in detections at the
Ukrainian borders, it concerned mostly non-re-

gional transiting third-country nationals, such
as Afghan and Syrians.
For the first time the most commonly detected migrants on this route were from
Syria (30), detected at the Polish, Romanian
and Hungarian land borders with Ukraine.
Other nationalities detected in comparably high overall numbers on this route were
Ukrainian (26) and Russian (20).

4.3. Clandestine entry
Restricting the FRAN indicator on detections
of illegal border-crossing at BCPs (1B) to the
external land and sea borders of the EU and
to detections confirmed to be clandestine entries (e.g. hiding in means of transport), results
in extremely low detections for the whole of
the EU especially compared with other indicators of irregular migration. In Q1 2014, 236
detections were reported at EU level.
However, it should be noted that some Member States do not have systematic data collection system in place to report on this
indicator. For example, this is the case in
Spain. Indeed, although detections of clandestine entries are made on a daily basis at
the BCPs in Ceuta and Melilla or on the regular ferry connections between Morocco
and Spain, these detections are not distinguished from detections of illegal bordercrossing (1A).
When considering the data available, most
of the detections were reported from Croatia, mainly at its land border with Serbia.
Considerable lorry traffic goes through this
border section, and is particularly used for
international traffic from the Western Balkans countries to the EU, but also as transit corridor for large lorry traffic from Turkey
to western EU Member States. Most of the
migrants were Eritreans or Syrians, and it is
likely that these migrants had initially crossed
the border illegally from Turkey and were in

transit to their final destination within the
EU when detected by the Croatian bordercontrol authorities.
Bulgaria also reported a high number of detections of clandestine entry at its land border with Turkey. This increase may be linked
to the strengthened surveillance along the
land border with Turkey that would trigger
facilitators to attempt alternative illegal entry to the EU, notably by hiding migrants in
vehicles. Although no casualties have been
reported this quarter, clandestine entry represents considerable risks for migrants’ lives,
in particular due to the threat of suffocation.

4.4. Detections of facilitators
Between the beginning of the FRAN data collection and the year 2011, the number of detections of facilitators of irregular migration
has been steadily falling. Since then, the midterm trend has been rather stable leading to
a recent modest hike, while the number of
illegal border-crossings has significantly increased. According to interviews conducted
with migrants, one important reason for this
divergence seems to be the more cautious behaviours of facilitators, who frequently stay
behind when migrants embark on boats or
approach the EU external land border.
Additionally, a widespread shift towards the
abuse of legal channels and document fraud
in an attempt to mimic legal entry to the EU
has resulted in facilitators being able to operate remotely and inconspicuously rather than
accompanying migrants during high-risk activities such as border-crossing.
During the first quarter of this year FRAN
data shows 2 015 detections of facilitators
of irregular migration, just 5% more than
during the previous quarter. The top three
Member States (France, Italy, and Greece)
reported the majority of the numbers; together they accounted for more than 60% of

23 of 52

Frontex · FRAN Quarterly · q1 2014

all detections of facilitators at the EU level.
This distribution which accumulates in the
Mediterranean countries may be indicative
of difficult border sections that require more
assistance from the facilitators, although in
most cases facilitators were reported as being detected inland.
Member States tend to detect more domestic facilitators than any other nationality; very
often most of the top reporting countries for
this indicator tend to report their own citizens as facilitators more frequently than any
other single nationality. Hence, in most reporting periods the top nationalities of facilitators tend to be consistent with the top
reporting countries for this indicator. However, in Q1 2014 the most commonly detected
nationality of facilitators was Bangladeshi
(144), followed by the Member State nationalities Italy (137), Spain (117) and France (100).

4.5. Detections of illegal stay
In Q1 2014, there were over 86 000 detections of illegal stay in the EU, which is in the
range of detections reported for the previous quarter and for Q1 2013.
The number of detections of illegal stay are
nearly four times larger then detections of illegal border-crossing (in Q1 2014, detections
of illegal border-crossing totalled 22 498). This
difference is due to the fact that migrants detected for illegal stay may be repeatedly detected in a quarter, either in the same or in
different Member States. Another factor explaining the difference is that many detections of illegal stay concerned overstaying
migrants. However, there are no data available that would be able to establish the contribution of these two factors in the overall
total and thus obtain a more accurate picture of the number of individuals staying illegally in the EU during this quarter or any
other time period.

24 of 52

As has been the case since Q4 2012, Germany
reported the largest number of detections of
illegal stay (over 12 000 detections), mostly
Syrians. The detections of illegal stay in Germany have doubled between Q1 2010 and Q1
2014, making Germany by far the most popular destination country for illegal migration
within the EU. Several factors may explain
this increase, including the German asylum
policy that may attract migrants in search
of the best conditions for international protection among EU Member States, as well as
the relatively better economic conditions of
Germany compared to other Member States,
that offers more economical opportunities
for migrants.
Compared to the previous quarter, the main
increase was in fact reported by Bulgaria,
where detections doubled between Q3 2013
and Q1 2014. This large increase, mostly Syrians, is connected with the large numbers
of arrivals of migrants crossing the border
illegally in Q3 2013. As of November 2013,
detections of illegal border-crossing have
decreased but migrants who were not returned may still be staying in Bulgaria.
In terms of nationalities, Syrians ranked first,
reaching a peak in Q1 2014 with 11 156 detections. Similar to the detections of illegal
border-crossings and asylum applications,
the number of Syrians detected staying illegally has risen sharply from mid-2013, as
a consequence of people fleeing the country (Fig. 11). However, this total also includes
detections in Sweden (over 3 000), which
for administrative reasons mostly coincide
with Syrians applying for asylum. Nevertheless, Bulgaria reported the largest number of detections of Syrians staying illegally,
probably as a consequence of the large flow
of Syrians crossing the border illegally from
Turkey to Bulgaria in Q2 and Q3 2013.

Other nationalities that were detected in significant numbers included Moroccans (6 278),

4.6. Refusals of entry
In Q1 2014 there were 24 903 refusals of entry at the external border, one of the lowest
quarterly totals since systematic data collection has been in place, beginning in 2009.

This low total, corresponding with a 16% decrease compared to the previous quarter, is
associated with a decrease in refusals of entry at the land borders in Poland. This is explained by fewer refusals of entry to Russians
at the land border with Belarus and fewer refusals of entry to Ukrainians at the land border with Ukraine.
Regarding the decrease in refusals of entry
to Russians, Q1 2014 marked the end of a
2-year phenomenon that saw large number
of Chechens being refused entry at the BCP
Terespol and then applying for asylum and
continuing their journey to other Member
States, mostly to Germany. This decrease is
due to a series of measures introduced by
Germany and Poland to tackle the phenomenon. This includes media campaigning in
Chechnya informing people that Germany
did not systematically grant asylum to Russians of Chechen origin.
Regarding the decrease in refusals of entry to
Ukrainians, this was mostly due to fewer refusals of entry at the Polish land border with

Figure 13. In spite of a substantial decrease, Poland continued to refuse entry to more third-country citizens than any
other Member State. The most concerned nationals were Ukrainian, Russians and Belarusians

ians continue to be the main nationality refused entry, representing 13% of the total.

Despite this decreasing trend, Poland continues to report the largest number of refusals,
nearly twice as many as Hungary, which is the
second ranking Member State, and Ukrain-

In terms of reasons for refusals, by far the
two main reasons for refusals of entry in the
EU were ‘no valid visa’ and ‘has no appropriate documentation justifying the purpose of

stay’. Together they represented nearly half
of all refusals of entry in the first quarter of
2014. Since data collection has begun, these
two reasons have ranked first.
A trend that is developing is the increasing
number of refusals of entry for already staying more than 3 months in the EU. At the beginning of 2013, about 1 000 persons were
refused entry for this reason per quarter,
but in the last quarter of 2013 and in the first
quarter of 2014 this number rose over 1 800.
Most of the persons who were refused entry
for this reason were Serbian nationals (754 in
Q1 2014), representing about 50% of all persons refused entry for this reason in Q1 2014.
Most of them were refused entry at the land
border between Hungary and Serbia (90%).
The reason for this increase is likely a consequence of the new Regulation (EU) No
610/2013 of 26 June 2013, which redefined the
concept of a ‘short stay’ for third-country nationals in the Schengen area and which entered into force on 18 October 2013.
As of 18 October 2013, the vast majority of
the third-country nationals, irrespective of
being visa required or exempt, who travel to

28 of 52

the Schengen area for a short stay (contrary
to residing in one Member State for longer
than three months) can stay ‘90 days in any
180-day period’. Contrary to the definition
which was in force until 18 October 2013, the
new concept is more precise by setting the
duration in days instead of months.
In order to apply the 90 days / 180-day rule,
a calculator has been developed for the general public and for the Member States’ authorities. The calculator is a tool only, it does
not constitute a right to stay for a period resulting from its calculation.

4.7. Asylum claims
The number of asylum claims reported by
FRAN members during Q1 2014 totalled
93 109. This does not include data for Austria for March. The trend compared to the
previous quarter decreased by 7%, but compared to Q1 2013 was up by 30%.
As in the previous quarters, most of the applications were reported from Germany and
Sweden (48%). For these two Member States,
quarterly applications decreased for the second time in a year, after reaching a peak in Q3

2013, but the levels of applications were still
much higher in 2014 than they were a year
ago. This decrease coincided with fewer detections of illegal border-crossing in Q1 2014
than in Q3 2013, in particular detections of
Syrians who dropped from 11 917 to 4 633.
Asylum applications in Bulgaria also decreased from over 3000 in Q3 2013 to about
2000 in Q1 2014. This decrease coincided with
a drop in detections of illegal border-crossing at the land border between Bulgaria and
Turkey. In other Member States, asylum applications remained fairly stable.
In terms of nationalities, Syrians continued
to rank first, representing almost 20% of all
asylum applications.

4.8. Document fraud
In Q1 2014 there were just over 2 300 detections of document fraud on entry to the EU/
Schengen area from third countries, which
is a decrease of 5% compared to the previous year in Q1. Omitting the data from Switzerland, which started reporting in 2014 and

the numbers from the new EU Member State
Croatia, which only began reporting after
June 2013, the decline would have been even
more significant.
Spain, Italy, France and Greece reported the
most detections of document fraud on entry
at the external border, together accounting
for more than half of all detections at the EU
level. The long-term upward trend in Spain
also continued in Q1 2014, when the country
reported more detections than ever, the most
common of which were related to Moroccans.
Hungary reported the largest number of document fraud cases in a first quarter since the
EDF data collection started and among all
other EU countries it was the second largest increase in absolute numbers between
Q4 2013 and Q1 2014. Of document fraudsters reported from Hungary, most were nationals of Western Balkan countries (mainly
Albanians, Serbs and Kosovo* citizens) and
Ukraine. Slovenia, on the other hand, reported
the largest percentage rise (+189%) since the
last quarter. This increase was mainly caused

by Western Balkan nationals using counterfeit stamps in their passport.

4.8.2. Between the Schengen area and
non-Schengen EU Member States

Despite a substantial decrease, Italy still
ranked second in terms of detected document fraud cases. But in contrast to Hungary
and France, only a few document fraudsters
were from the Western Balkans or the EU’s
eastern neighbourhood. Instead, the most
prevalent nationalities were Sri Lankans, Nigerians and Syrians.

As well as at the external border, it is also important that at the EU level there were over
950 detections of document fraud between
the Schengen area and non-Schengen EU
Member States and between two non-Schengen EU Member States. As is normally the
case, many of these were reported on entry
to the UK, a common destination country for
irregular migrants travelling from the Schengen area. By far the most commonly detected
migrants in this category were from Albania (374), mostly detected entering the UK.

At the EU level, of the 107 nationalities detected using fraudulent documents to illegally
enter the EU or Schengen area from a third
county, the most commonly detected were
from Syria (258), Albania (206) and Morocco
(144). Syrians were detected at a range of
locations but Albanians were mostly apprehended on entry to Greece and Moroccans
were mostly detected at Ceuta and Melilla.
4.8.1. Document fraud on exit from the
EU/Schengen area
In addition to the 2 300 detections on entry
there was also an increasing trend of nearly
700 detections on exit, hence around a quarter of detections were on exit but this is likely
to be an underestimation as checks are less
stringent on exit than they are on entry. In
fact some Member States do not perform
exit checks. On the other hand, a number of
Member States including Croatia, Denmark,
France, Hungary, Norway and Slovakia reported that a third or more of their cases
were on exit. Only Romania and Bulgaria
detected more document fraudsters on exit
than on entry. In the case of Romania most
exit detections were of Romanians and to a
lesser extent Syrians exiting the land border
towards Hungary. In Bulgaria, the majority of detections on exit were made at the
BCPs Ruse to Romania or Kalotina to Serbia.

4.8.3. Intra-Schengen flights
The EDF-RAN data exchange also considers detections of document fraud on intraSchengen flights (and to a minor extent ferry
connections) where no border checks are systematically performed. The strong increases
in the number of detections throughout 2013
peaked with an all-time high of 1 271 cases in
Q4 2013. The first quarter of 2014 was marked
by a drop of more than 40%, resulting in 718
reported cases of document fraud on intraSchengen flights and nine cases on intraSchengen ferry connections.
4.8.4. Migrants from Albania
In Q1 2014, 763 Albanians were detected using more than 900 fraudulent documents
(including authentic passports containing fraudulent documents such as visas or
stamps), which is a decrease compared to
both the previous quarter and Q1 2013. Nevertheless, Albanians still represent the biggest
proportion of document fraud at the EU level.
4.8.5. Migrants from Syria
Overall, 566 Syrians were detected using fraudulent documents in Q1 2014. After a peak of 920
Syrians who were detected in the last quarter

30 of 52

of 2013, the number appears to have returned
to a lower level rather common for the first half
of 2013. Syrians were mostly detected on entry to the Schengen area from third countries
(231), followed by intra-Schengen flights (193),
which suggests that many are illegally crossing the external border and then using fraudulent documents for secondary movements.
4.8.6. Migrants from Eritrea and Somalia
Document fraud committed by nationals
from different countries in the Horn of Africa often shows similar patterns. Three quarters of all incidents related to this region’s
nationals are detected during secondary
movements after illegal entry into the EU
(see chapter ‘Illegal border-crossings: Central
Mediterranean’). In Q1 2014, Member States
reported 193 cases of document fraud committed by Eritrean and 151 by Somali nationals, compared to Q1 2013 an increase of 159
and 19, respectively.

4.9. Returns
4.9.1. Return decisions
In Q1 2014 there were 55 787 third-country nationals subject to an obligation to leave the EU
as a result of an administrative or judicial decision.* For technical reasons this total does
not include data from Austria and Spain.
The main feature during Q1 2014 was the large
increase in return decisions issued by Bulgaria,
where return decisions doubled in relation to
Q3 2013. This was due to a large number of
migrants crossing the border illegally in the
past few months.
At the Member State level there is often a discrepancy between the number of return decisions reached and the number of effective
returns carried out. Some of the differences
may be due to time lags between judicial decisions and physical returns, while other dif-

ferences may be due to the disappearance of
migrants once a decision has been reached.
More Syrians were subject to return decisions
than any other nationality (6 066), mostly in
Bulgaria (57%). However, these return decisions are not often implemented, as evidence
by the low number of effective returns (69),
mostly to Turkey.
Note that the absolute total number of migrants subject to return decisions is still underestimated by this indicator, as data on
decisions were unavailable from, inter alia,
France, the Netherlands and Sweden, where
it is assumed that high numbers of decisions
were reached.
4.9.2. Effective returns
In Q1 2014, Member States reported 36 841
effective returns, but Austrian data for this
period were not yet available. Bearing in mind
this limitation the number of third country
nationals effectively returned to outside the
EU remained stable compared to most previous quarters.
As has usually been the case for this indicator, the UK conducted the largest number
of returns in Q1 2014 of nearly 150 nationalities with Indians (18%) ranking top. Greece
ranked second in terms of the number of
active returns, with Albanians representing
the majority (56%) and the largest number
for a single nationality in any Member State.

* This total does not
include data from
Austria and Spain.

Effective returns have been rather stable
since 2011 when systematic data collection
on this indicator began, ranging between
10 000 and 15 000 per month, the average
being around 13 000. By contrast, detections
of illegal border-crossing fluctuated importantly during the same period, from 2 255 in
January 2013 to 20 285 in March 2011, with
an average of 9 066 per month. These large
differences in trends and patterns for these

two indicators are explained by the fact that
most migrants detected crossing the border illegally are in fact not returned because
they applied for asylum or due to the fact
that they cannot be returned to their country of origin for other reasons.

4.10.	Other illegal activities at
the border
Criminal groups that operate across the EU external borders pose a significant challenge to
European law-enforcement authorities. They
affect the overall management of the external
borders insofar as prevention of their activities demands substantial personal and financial resources of the European border agencies.
4.10.1. Trafficking in Human Beings
The International Labour Organisation recently published the report ‘Profits and Poverty: The Economics of Forced Labour’, in
which it estimated the extent, cost and profits generated through forced labour, including
from trafficked persons held in debt bondage
or work in slave-like conditions. The study
says that two thirds of the estimated global
profits of USD 150 billion, around USD 99 billion, came from commercial sexual exploitation, while another USD 51 billion resulted
from forced labour exploitation, including
domestic work, agriculture and other economic activities. It additionally provides new
evidence of the key socio-economic factors
that increase the risk of falling victim to coercion and abuse.
Although the report provides a regional
breakdown containing only a combined estimate for all of the developed economies
globally, their calculated profits are certainly
an adequate approximation for most of the
European Union countries. According to the
study, in the developed economies and the
EU the average annual profit for traffickers
is EUR 5 500 per victim of forced domestic

work and around EUR 60 000 per victim of
forced sexual exploitation. The estimated
profits in consequence presume the availability of vast illegal proceeds for large investments into the recruitment, facilitation,
document fraud and transport of victims of
THB into the EU.
The identification of cases of trafficking in
human beings remains a demanding task for
border authorities. The constant changes in
modi operandi and the use of deceptive means
to make the victim believe in promising opportunities in Europe makes the detection of
victims during the short time window of a
border-control extremely challenging.
During Q1 2014 substantial disruptions of
criminal groups involved in trafficking in human beings were reported by Spanish authorities. In a recent operation, the Spanish police
have dismantled a criminal network of Asian
origin responsible for trafficking in human
being for sexual exploitation. The women,
mainly of Chinese origin, were recruited in
their country of origin with fake promises of
work in Spain. Once in Spain, they were collected at Madrid-Barajas Airport and taken
directly to one of the locations where the
network was holding other women for similar purposes. Taking advantage of their lack
of knowledge of the language and the fact
that they were in a foreign country where
they did not know anyone, the perpetrators
withdrew their documents and forced them
into sexual work to payoff the money they
borrowed to get to Spain. The victims were
between 20 and 30 years old and were held
in several houses and then moved to karaoke places, hotels or other houses.
4.10.2. Smuggling of excise goods at the
eastern borders
In the first quarter of 2014, the number of tobacco smuggling incidents reported through
Frontex Joint Operations decreased by 60%

compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. Nevertheless, the smuggling of cigarettes remained
the main cross-border crime at the eastern
borders. Border guards reported 18 cases of
cigarette contraband through JO Focal Points
Land, most of which were detected at the
border with Ukraine (14) and to a lesser extent with Belarus (4). Similarly to the previous
quarter (Q4 2013), no cases of cigarette smuggling were detected at the Moldovan borders.
According to JO Focal Points Land, Ukraine
was the only country which did not see a
drop in cases of cigarettes illegally exported
to the EU (10 cases in Q4 2013, compared to
14 in Q1 2014). Medyka (Poland) and Zahony
(Hungary) were the most used BCPs for contraband activities reported to Frontex.

example, Polish border guards detected two
Polish citizens with 3 cardboard boxes wrapped
in black plastic, containing 30 000 cigarettes
without excise stamps worth about EUR 4 125
in total. They crossed the river Bug on the ice
from Ukraine to Poland to give to Polish accomplices. During the return to Ukraine they swept
snow on the ice in order to cover their tracks.
Contraband cigarettes were also often captured by green border patrols when they
were left by perpetrators at the green borders on the river banks to be picked up later,
as in cases reported by Poland and Hungary.
Contraband cigarettes were also smuggled
aboard light planes and motorized hang gliders
across EU external borders. In February 2014,
for example, the Polish border guards observed
two cases of flights over the Poland-Ukraine
state border (11 February 2014 and 18 February 2014), one of which was accompanied by
a lantern in the sky. It was possibly released
in order to distract the border guards or to
verify the strength and direction of the wind.
South Eastern Europe

Similar to previous quarters, smuggled cigarettes had excise stamps from Ukraine, Belarus and the Russian Federation. Modi operandi
remained also unchanged smuggling in personal belongings or in different means of
transportation hidden in specially constructed
compartments or in the cargo as well as outside of BCPs via green land borders or rivers.
On 6 February 2014, Polish border guards revealed 1 228 800 cigarettes worth about EUR
176 664, including 3 000 cigarettes with Ukrainian excise stamps and 1 225 800 cigarettes with
Belarusian stamps. The goods were hidden in
the cargo of mineral wool and building boards
in a semi-trailer lorry driven by a Polish citizen.
Smuggling via rivers was still a risk in the first
quarter of 2014 due to the winter weather enabling smugglers to use the ice as cover. For

34 of 52

The numbers of detections of cigarette smuggling reported to Frontex in South Eastern
Europe show to be very low in Q1 2014 and
were related to individual traffic through private or public transport. In the first half of
February, Serbia’s customs and border police services have prevented an attempt to
smuggle around 300 000 cigarettes exiting at the Đerdap border-crossing in eastern Serbia. The cigarettes were found in a
lorry with a declared load of marble dust destined for Romania. The brand of the majority of the seized cigarettes was ‘Marble and
Ashima’ and had no excise stamps. For that
reason, authorities believe they were taken
over directly from the factory. Another brand,
‘Monte’, was also found in the lorry, but with
excise stamps. The case has been taken over
by the Serbian justice authorities.

Contraband cigarettes crossing from the Russian
Federation decreases fivefold

Western Mediterranean sea
In Q1 2014, routes from the African continent
to Europe, especially to the Iberian Peninsula, were again used by criminal organisations for the trafficking of cannabis. The main
provider of cannabis resin to Europe is Morocco, although its production capacities are
in decline while those in Afghanistan are increasing. Amounts seized in Spain, the country reporting the largest detections, clearly
exceeded the domestic demand. From Spain,
shipments of cannabis resin are forwarded
to other countries of the European Union.
In February 2014 the Spanish National Police
seized 22 tonnes of hashish that were transported by boat across the Mediterranean Sea.
The drug originated from Morocco, whereas its
final destination was unknown. As a result of
the operation, 12 persons were apprehended
and luxury vehicles as well as large amounts
of cash and diamonds were seized. The head
of the organised crime group lived in the city
of Almeria and was the owner of several companies, which import and export horticultural
products. These entitie, operating under the
cover of a legal company, with allowed the
trafficker to have the necessary maritime infrastructure to transport the narcotics.
As for cocaine and according to EMCDDA calculations based on seizure data*, between
2001 and 2011, Spain accounted for around
50% of all cocaine seizures in the EU. Large
shipments usually travelled by sea from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela to Spain and Portugal.
A large share of the substance also arrived
from South America via Africa.
In February 2014, the Spanish National Police
seized 360 kg of cocaine in the port of Barcelona coming from Colombia. The container
was transporting several thousand cans of

4.10.3. Drug trafficking

The number of contraband cigarettes brought across the
border from Russia to Estonia decreased by 5.5 times in
2013, compared to the previous year. The significant drop is
due to a new policy implemented last year which applies to
people transporting cigarettes on a small scale. Now they
not only have to hand over the illicit cigarettes but they are
also a subject to a fine. Apart from the decreasing trend of
smuggled cigarettes from the Russian Federation, the new
approach decreased the number of travellers crossing the
border, and increased sales of legal cigarettes. In Narva, the
largest border town legal sales of cigarettes, increased

coffee powder and the drugs were found inside 717 of these boxes. When the boats arrived at the Spanish port, people working in
the shipyards recovered the goods and delivered them to the drug trafficking organisation. As a result of the operation, seven
suspects were arrested, all members of an
organisation specialised in smuggling containers of drugs from South America.

In another large operation conducted in
March 2014, the Spanish National Police arrested 42 persons and dismantled an organisation responsible for the trafficking of
‘shabú’ in Spain. In Asia, ‘Shabú’ is known
as ‘the drug of the poor’ and technically it
is methamphetamine in pure state. During
the operation 8 kg of this psychotropic drug
were seized. The drug was being transported

by ‘mules’ through the Barcelona airport. The
organisation responsible for introducing the
drug into Spain was composed of citizens of
African origin who were using a front company that imported and exported vehicles in
order to divert attention of the authorities.
Despite the relative decrease in the amount
of drugs transported from Morocco, a new
modus operandi to transport illicit drugs was
detected. In March 2014, the Spanish Civil
Guard dismantled a drug trafficking network
responsible for transporting hashish from
Morocco to Spain by helicopter. The traffickers used to fly the aircraft during the night
documentation, lights and a flight plan. As
a result of this operation six persons were
arrested and 704 kg of hashish was seized.

4.11. Passenger flow
Since January 2014, Member States have
been invited to regularly report on passenger
flows at their external borders under FRAN.
Their reporting is not yet comprehensive and
thus it is not yet possible to have an EU-wide
overview of passenger flow across the external borders at the EU level. Nevertheless,
some limited analyses are possible focusing
on the Member States that reported all necessary data for the three months of Q1 2014.

36 of 52

Member States merged both flows, while others reported only arrivals from third countries.
The seven Member States reporting entries from third-countries and non-Schengen Member States for all three months of
Q1 2014 totalled more than 22 millions arrivals.
All Member States recorded their lowest total
for February. This is partly due to the fact that
the month of February has fewer days than
any other month. Nevertheless, even after
normalisation of all months against a standard month of 30 days, February recorded the
lowest total suggesting that indeed fewer
passengers travelled during that month. Passenger flow increased sharply from February
to March, a trend that is likely to continue until passenger peak time in July-August.
For these seven Member States, the monthly
arrivals were compared with refusals of entry. As passenger flows vary widely among
these Member States, comparisons among
Member States were made on the basis of
a rate, in this case the number of refusals of
entry for every 100 000 entries. On average,
these seven Member States refused entry to
16 travellers for every 100 000 entries. Out of
these Member States, five have rather similar rate of refusals of entry (between 12 and
19 refusals of entry for every 100 000 passengers), but Latvia reported a much higher
rate possibly linked to the low passenger flow,
while Denmark reported the lowest.

4.11.1. At the air borders

Three Member States reported about
100 000 entries from third countries only
for all three months of Q1 2014. They show
the same pattern of fewer passengers during February, followed by a stark increase between February and March.

At the air borders, one of the main difficulties
for most Schengen Member States is to distinguish between the flow of passengers entering from third-countries and those entering
from a non-Schengen Member State. Some

When analysed against refusals of entry, the
rate for Member States reporting only entries
from third countries (thus excluding entries
from non-Schengen Member States) was
much higher than for Member States report-

4.11.2. At the land border
At the land border, data on passengers arriving from third countries were available for
12 border sections, totalling about 6 million
passengers in Q1 2014. Like at the air border,
passenger flow was lowest for February, even
after normalisation for 30 days, and increased
sharply between February and March.
Among these 12 border sections, the three
Polish border sections ranked first, highlighting the busy traffic at Polish external land
borders. The heaviest flow was by far at the
border with Ukraine.
At the land border, the breakdown by nationality is available and shows that Ukrainians
represented nearly a third of all passengers
among these 12 border sections. They were
the main nationality at the four border sections with Ukraine.
In Q1 2014, regular traffic of Ukrainians was
the largest in March. It is difficult to link this
increase with the events in Ukraine as historical data is lacking and comparison with
previous year not possible. The increase in
March might also be linked to a seasonal increase that will peak in the summer months.
When analysed against refusals of entry per
100 000 entries, large difference can be noted
among border sections. While the average
for these 12 border sections is 134 refusals
per 100 000 passengers, the highest rate is
reported at the land border between Hungary and Serbia, due to the fact that this is
the main crossing point for Serbians travelling to the EU, and the lowest at the border
between Poland and the Russian Federation.

ing passengers from third countries and from
non-Schengen Member States. However, as
only three Member States reported on entries from third countries only, it is difficult
to draw conclusions.

Figure 21. Helicopter used to transport
drugs from Morocco to Spain

Finally, refusals of entry per 100 000 entries
at the land border (averaging 134 refusals per
100 000 entries in Q1 2014) were much higher
than refusals of entries per 100 000 entries
at the air border (averaging 16 refusals per
100 000 entries). This large difference may
be explained by three reasons: first, the reporting at the air border is for arrivals from
third countries and non-Schengen Member
States. It is very likely there is a large difference between the rate of refusals on entry
from third countries and from non-Schengen Member States, with the rate of refusal
likely to be much higher for entries from third
countries. Second, air travellers typically plan
their trip better while land passengers may
more easily attempt to cross the border even
though they do not meet all the conditions
for entry. A third reason is associated with
pre-embarkation checks at the air border that
enable airlines companies to deny boarding
to a passenger not meeting all the conditions
for entry to the EU. For some Member States,
boarding denial may be as large as refusals
of entry at the border itself.

Table 1. Refusals of entry per 100 000 passengers were much higher
at the land border (134 refusals per 100 000 air passengers) than at
the air border (16 refusals of entries per 100 000)

Frontex · FRAN Quarterly · q1 2014

Sources and Methods
For the data concerning detections at the external borders, some of the border types are
not applicable to all FRAN Member States.
This pertains to data on all FRAN indicators
since the data are provided disaggregated
by border type. The definitions of detections
at land borders are therefore not applicable (excluding borders with non-Schengen
principalities) for Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Iceland,
Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland and
the UK. For Cyprus, the land border refers to
the Green Line demarcation with the area
not under the effective control of the government of the Republic of Cyprus. For sea
borders, the definitions are not applicable for
land-locked Member States including Austria,
the Czech Republic, Hungary, Luxembourg,
Slovakia and Switzerland.
In addition, data on detections of illegal border-crossing at land, air and sea BCPs (1B) are
not available for Iceland, Ireland and Spain
and in Greece (these detections are included
in the data for Indicator 1A). Data for Norway only includes detections of illegal border-crossing at land and sea BCPs (1B), not
between BCPs (1A).
In Italy, detections of illegal border-crossing
at sea BCPs are only reported for intra-EU
border-crossing from Greece. Data on detections of illegal border-crossing between
sea BCPs (1A) are not available for Ireland.
Data on apprehension (FRAN Indicator 2) of
facilitators is not available for Ireland. For Italy, the data are not disaggregated by border
type, but are reported as total apprehensions (not specified). Data for Italy and Norway also include the facilitation of illegal stay
and work. For Romania, the data include
land intra-EU detections on exit at the border with Hungary.

52 of 52

For the data concerning detections of illegal
stay (FRAN Indicator 3), data on detections
at exit are not available for Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Spain and the UK. Data on inland
detections are not available for the Netherlands starting with the year 2012.
Data on refusals of entry (FRAN Indicator 4)
at the external EU borders are not disaggregated by reason of refusal for Ireland and
the UK. Refusals of entry at the Spanish land
borders at Ceuta and Melilla (without the issuance of a refusal form) are reported separately and are not included in the presented
FRAN data.
The data on applications for international
protection (FRAN Indicator 5) are not disaggregated by place of application (type of
border on entry or inland applications) for
Austria, the Czech Republic and Slovenia.
For these countries, only the total number
of applications is reported. For France, only
asylum applications at the external borders
are reported, not inland applications. For the
UK, data reported for applications at air BCPs
also include applications at sea BCPs.
The data on return decisions issued (FRAN
indicator 7A) are not available for Ireland,
France, The Netherlands and Sweden. The
data on effective returns (FRAN indicator
7B) are not available for Ireland. In addition,
the data of effective returns are not disaggregated by return operation (voluntary and
forced) for Spain. The data on voluntary effective returns (FRAN Indicator 7A) are not
disaggregated by type of return operation
(IOM assisted and others) for Belgium, Czech
Republic, Finland and the Netherlands. The
data on forced effective returns (FRAN Indicator 7A) are not disaggregated by type of return operation (enforced by Member Stated
and by Joint Operations) for Belgium, Finland,
Iceland and the Netherlands.
