Frontex official publications fall into four main categories: risk analysis, training, operations
and research, each marked with a distinct graphic identifier. Risk analysis publications
bear a triangular symbol formed by an arrow drawing a triangle, with a dot at the centre.
Metaphorically, the arrow represents the cyclical nature of risk analysis processes and its
orientation towards an appropriate operational response. The triangle is a symbol of ideal
proportions and knowledge, reflecting the pursuit of factual exactness, truth and exhaustive
analysis. The dot at the centre represents the intelligence factor and the focal point where
information from diverse sources converges to be processed, systematised and shared as
analytical products. Thus, Frontex risk analysis is meant to be at the centre and to form
a reliable basis for its operational activities.

Executive summary
In comparison with the first quarter of 2014,
the second quarter saw an increase in all of
the indicators of irregular migration and asylum exchanged under the Frontex Risk Analysis Network (FRAN). A factor in this general
trend was the annually recurring cycle of seasonal variation, whereby the summer months
of each year are usually marked by increased
pressure at the external borders.
However, the increase in irregular migration was far above what would usually be
expected based on seasonal fluctuations at
this time of the year. In the second quarter
of 2014, the number of illegal border-crossings reported by the Member States was at
its highest level since FRAN data collection
began in 2007. In fact, compared to the second quarter of 2013, detections at the external borders increased by more than 170%.
As many as 90% of the irregular migrants
were reported from the sea border of the EU.
Compared to one year ago, Italy reported a
more than eightfold increase in detections
of illegal border-crossing, while the number
in Greece more than doubled. Detections in
Spain increased by 50%, even though from a
significantly lower base.
Overall, detections reported from the Italian
sea border represented almost three-quarters
of all detected illegal border-crossings in Q2
2014 and for the second consecutive quarter
Eritreans were the most reported nationality, representing around a third of all detections at this border section.
The intensified illegal migration by sea in the
Central Mediterranean was not only related
to improved weather conditions, but also to
the presence of a large number of sub-Sa-

haran Africans in the coastal areas of Libya.
The unstable situation in Libya has led to increased violence against immigrants, which
acts as a push factor playing into the hands
of facilitators.
Moreover, Italy continued its maritime operation Mare Nostrum in the waters of the Sicily Channel between Italy and Libya. It was
launched in October 2013 to controlling migrant flows through increased surveillance
and search-and-rescue activities.
Detections of Syrians, i.e. the second most
reported nationality on this route, increased
sevenfold in the Central Mediterranean in Q2
2014 compared to the previous quarter. The
situation of Syrians seeking refuge in Egypt
from the ongoing violent conflict in their
home country also remained difficult. Due
to hard economic and political conditions in
the country Syrians continued to leave Egypt
in massive numbers, mostly routing through
Libya hoping to find an opportunity to reach
Italy by boat.
The number of irregular migrants detected
on the Eastern Mediterranean route in Q2
2014 was almost twice as high as in Q2 2013
and in the previous quarter. A range of operational activities has significantly reduced
detections at the Greek and Bulgarian land
borders to Turkey; although, in the long term,
a displacement of the flow of irregular migrants to the Aegean Sea was observed.
The highest number of detections of illegal
border-crossing at land borders in Q2 2014
was reported by Hungary, although this number was two-thirds lower than in Q2 2013
and 15% lower than in Q1 2014. Afghans remained the most reported nationality at this

border section, suggesting sustained secondary movements from Greece through the
Western Balkan region to Hungary and further on to other Member States, in spite of
increased operational activities at the EU’s
external border with Turkey.
As it happened in the past, large groups of
migrants tried to cross to Ceuta and Melilla
illegally. The attempts to cross the Spanish
land border continued in Q2, but fewer migrants were successful in crossing due to
the reinforcement of the fence. The number
of persons detected for illegal crossings into
Ceuta or Melilla decreased by 40% compared
to last quarter, reaching a similar level as in
Q2 2013. In contrast, detections at the Western Mediterranean sea border rose by 50%.
Several indicators point to a continued increase in migration along this route.
In the second quarter of 2014, the number of
asylum seekers exceeded 100 000 applications and reached the largest number since
FRAN data collection began. Of all FRAN
indicators, the number of asylum applications showed the most regular long-term
upward trend. The annual total asylum numbers have increased by almost a fifth every
year since 2010. While in 2011, a larger proportion of asylum seekers migrated due to

6 of 52

the bad economic situation in their home
countries, in 2014 the share of those escaping violence and armed conflict grew. In this
reporting period, the number of asylum applications was 20% higher than during the
previous quarter of 2014 and a third higher
than in Q2 2013.
Asylum applications were increasingly concentrated in the top destination countries.
Since 2010, the share of applications for international protection submitted in the current top three asylum destinations (Germany,
Sweden and Italy) has grown from 37% to
around 60% of the total number reported
to the FRAN.
In general, Syrian refugees continued to be
the number one nationality seeking international protection in the EU, representing
20% of all asylum applications submitted in
Q1 2014. Two-thirds of Syrian asylum seekers were reported from Germany, Sweden
and the Netherlands.
Eritreans, on the other hand, were the fastest growing nationality of asylum seekers in
Europe, as applications reported by Member States have increased by 270% since the
previous quarter and more than sixfold since
Q2 2013.

1. Introduction
FRAN Quarterly reports are prepared by the
Frontex Risk Analysis Unit and provide a regular overview of irregular migration at the
EU external borders, based on the irregularmigration data exchanged among Member
State border-control authorities within the
cooperative framework of the Frontex Risk
Analysis Network (FRAN) and its subsidiary,
the European Union Document-Fraud Risk
Analysis Network (EDF-RAN).
The main purpose of the FRAN Quarterlies
is to provide:
1.	feedback to the FRAN community in the
context of information exchange;
2.	a periodic update to the situational picture of irregular migration at EU level; and
3.	material for constructive discussion on reporting protocols and related trends and
patterns.
This report is intended to simultaneously
serve two objectives: first – to provide a
clear summary of the situation at the external border of the EU, and second – to serve
as an archive for future reference and comparative analyses. Consistent with standard
archival techniques, some information is repeated among sections to serve as context.

Harmonising complex, multi-source migration data among Frontex and Member States
is an ongoing process. Therefore, some of
the more detailed data and trends in this
report should be interpreted with caution
and, where possible, cross-referenced with
information from other sources. The statistics should be understood in the context of
the different levels of passenger flows passing through different border sections, the
activities of Member State border-control
authorities undertaken to secure different
border sections and widespread variation
in reporting and data-collection practices.
FRAN members and Member State risk analysis experts and border-control authorities are
considered the primary customers of these
reports. In addition to the discussions taking place during FRAN meetings, Member
State experts are invited and actively encouraged to examine and comment upon
the data and analyses presented here. Despite all efforts of the Frontex Risk Analysis
Unit and Member State experts involved in
data exchange and analyses, it is conceivable that minor errors will occur in these reports due to very challenging timelines and
the growing volume and complexity of the
data and other information exchanged within
the FRAN community.

2. Methodology
This, the 24th issue of the FRAN Quarterly, is a
comparative analysis of FRAN data collected
between April and June 2014 and exchanged
between 31 Member State border-control authorities within the framework of the FRAN.
The report presents the results of statistical
analysis of quarterly variations in eight irregular-migration indicators and one asylum indicator, aggregated at the level of the event.
Bi-monthly analytical reports exchanged by
Member States were also used for interpretative purposes and to provide qualitative information, as were other available sources of
information, such as Frontex Joint Operations.
Precise definitions of Indicators 1 to 6, aimed
at harmonising the data exchanged at EU
level, were presented in the annexes of the
Q1 and Q2 reports in 2009 and so are not
repeated here.
During the June 2010 FRAN Meeting, a proposal for a harmonised definition of the return
indicator was outlined and several questions
were presented in order to encourage discussion among FRAN members in view of es-

Monthly data on the following indicators were exchanged
among the FRAN community:
1A detections of illegal border-crossing between BCPs
1B detections of illegal border-crossing at BCPs
2 detections of suspected facilitators
3 detections of illegal stay
4 refusals of entry
5 asylum applications
6 document fraud (EDF-RAN)
7A return decisions for illegally staying third-country nationals

tablishing the regular collection of monthly
return data by Frontex. Subsequently, an online survey of FRAN members was conducted
to gather information and further stimulate
discussion to fine-tune the proposal for the
indicator. The 11th FRAN report (Q1 2011) was
the first to include analysis of Indicators 7A
and 7B, and the definitions of these indicators are included in an annex to that report.
Data collection commenced in January 2011.
The FRAN data-exchange has been in place
since September 2007. Data are exchanged
through the ICONet Internet platform, an interest group of the European Commission’s
CIRCA server. Member State monthly data
are based on a country template prepared by
the Frontex Risk Analysis Unit. The deadline
for submitting data for each month is the 25th
day of the subsequent month, with the exception of the end-of-year data, which are requested by 15 January each year. For this 24th
issue of the FRAN Quarterly, the target for
Member States to upload the monthly data
was thus 25 July 2014. In principle, data submitted subsequent to this date will be reflected in the next FRAN Quarterly, except
in cases where clarification is needed in order to proceed with comprehensive analysis.
Following the closure of the CIREFI working
group in April 2010, most of its mandates
and, of particular relevance, the exchange
of data were transferred to FRAN. Fortunately, most CIREFI indicators already overlapped with the monthly data exchange of
FRAN members. The exception was the indicator on returns, which was added as part
of the regular data exchange within FRAN at
the beginning of 2011.

In January 2012, the European Union Document-Fraud Risk Analysis Network
(EDF-RAN) was formed as a specialist forum to oversee the exchange and analyses
of detections of document fraud to illegally
cross the external borders and on all international flights. Data were backdated and
joined with those exchanged under a pilot
Tailored Risk Analysis released in 2011.
External borders refer to the borders between Member States and third countries.
The borders between the Schengen Associated Countries (Liechtenstein, Norway, Iceland and Switzerland) and third countries
are also considered as external borders. The
borders between the Schengen Associated
Countries and Schengen Member States are
considered as internal borders. For the indicators on detections of facilitators, illegal
stay and asylum, statistics are also reported
for detections at the land borders between
Schengen Member States and Schengen candidates (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania) or non-Schengen Member States (the UK
and Ireland), so that a total for EU Member
States and Schengen Associated Countries as
a whole can be presented. It was not possible to make this distinction for air and sea
borders because Member States do not habitually differentiate between extra-EU and
intra-EU air and sea connections but tend to
aggregate data for all arrivals.
When data are examined at the level of
third-country nationalities, a large percentage usually falls under categories ‘Other (not
specified)’ or ‘Unknown’. It is expected that
the percentage reported under these categories will decrease with time as Member
States improve the quality and speed of their
identification, data collection and reporting
practices; nationalities are often reported as
‘Unknown’ if an individual’s nationality cannot
be established before reports are submitted.

This issue of the FRAN Quarterly also includes the main findings of Frontex-coordinated Joint Operations active for at least a
proportion of Q2 2014. Air borders saw the
continuation of the JO Focal Points Air 2014
as well as the start of the JO Alexis 1. Sea
borders saw the renewal of the JO Poseidon
Sea, JO Hermes and JO Aeneas, as well as the
start of the JO Focal Points Sea 2014 and JO
Indalo 2014. Land borders saw the continuation of the JO Poseidon Land 2014 and the
start of both the JO Focal Points Land 2014
and JO Flexible Operational Activities 2014
whilst the return-related Project Attica 2013
also continued.
Both primary data source, such as interviews
with irregular migrants, and secondary data
source, such as reports of intelligence analysts, daily reports of deployed officers and
analytical products (weekly and bi-weekly
analytical reports for each abovementioned
operation) were used to provide an exhaustive overview of the situation at the external
borders of the EU. Additionally, open-source
data were researched as background information for the present analysis.

Acknowledgements
The Frontex Risk Analysis Unit would like
to express its gratitude to all FRAN and
EDF-RAN members and their associates in
Member State statistical, migration and document-fraud units who collect, aggregate
and exchange monthly data, also to the analysts who compile the bi-monthly analytical reports, on which much of the detailed
analyses presented here are based.
We are also grateful to Member State representatives who responded to requests for
additional information on key topics and
emerging trends.

4. Situational picture in Q2 2014
4.1. Detections of illegal
border-crossing

One third of all migrants reported from this
border were Eritrean nationals.

As reflected in FRAN data, the second quarter of 2014 saw a substantial increase in detections of illegal border-crossing at the EU
external borders compared to Q1 2014. Member States reported 68 589 irregular migrants, which is more than three times as
much as during the previous quarter. Furthermore, compared to the second quarter
of 2013 the number of detections grew by
around 45 000.

Member States reported the highest number of detections of Syrian refugees from the
EU’s external border since the beginning of
the armed conflict in their home country.
More than 10 000 Syrians tried to reach the
EU through the Italian sea border, while close
to 5 000 were detected at the Greek borders
with Turkey. In general, detections at the
Greek sea borders have been at the highest
level since 2009.

The sea borders of the EU, where more than
60 000 irregular migrants were reported by
Member States (i.e. six times as many as one
year ago) accounted for 90% of the detections
of illegal border-crossing. Detections reported
in the Central Mediterranean (around 53 000
in Q2 2014) represented almost three quarters of all illegal border-crossing detections.

Figure 2 shows the evolution of FRAN Indicator 1A – detections of illegal border-crossing
and the proportion of detections at the land
and sea borders of the EU per quarter since
the beginning of 2008. This figure clearly illustrates the particularly high proportion of
detections at the sea borders during the second quarter.

4.2. Routes

Figure 3 illustrates the level of detections of
illegal border-crossing during Q2 2013 and Q2
2014 (size of circles) and the degree of change
between these reporting periods (slopes) for
the top ten Member States. In Q2 2014, of the
Member States affected by illegal border–
crossings, most reported increased detections compared to the same period in 2013.
The biggest increase was reported by Italy
where detections rose eightfold, followed
by Spain with an increase of more than 50%.
In contrast, detections reported by Hungary
decreased by three quarters.

For more detailed analyses, detections of illegal border-crossing are frequently classified
into major irregular migration routes which
more accurately relate to regions of detection rather than linear routes taken. As illustrated in Figure 5, during the second quarter
of 2014 detections of illegal border-crossing
in the Central Mediterranean ranked first
among the main irregular migration routes,
following an eightfold increase compared
to Q2 2013. In the Eastern Mediterranean,
Member States reported an almost twofold
increase compared to the same time in 2013.
For most sea borders, the upward trend registered in Q2 2014 exceeded the usual seasonal increase.

Apart from analysing the changes in terms
of Member State distributions, it is also informative to consider these trends by the
nationality of the detected migrants at the
EU level. Figure 4 illustrates the number of
detections of illegal border-crossing by the
top ten nationalities during the second quarters of 2013 and 2014 (size of circles) and the
degree of change between these reporting periods (slopes). This clearly shows that
detections of Eritreans again increased the
most (by around nine times) in relative terms
among all nationalities compared to the same
period in 2013, followed on different levels by
Nigerians, Malians and Syrians.

4.2.1. Central Mediterranean route
In total, more than 53 000 migrants were
detected at the Central Mediterranean route
in Q2 2014 according to Frontex operational
data. The number of detections in the Central Mediterranean has not only been higher
than during the past winter due to improved
maritime weather conditions, but reached
the highest level recorded since FRAN data

tral Mediterranean peaked in regular intervals, as shown in weeks 15, 19, 24, 26 and 29.
After each peak detections decreased drastically and then gradually grew again.
According to Frontex operational data, the
number of Eritreans detected in the Central
Mediterranean rose to a record level. Since
the first quarter of the year, the number of
reported Eritrean irregular migrants increased
tenfold from 1 522 to 16 207. Reports suggest
that many of the Eritreans had been living
for some time in Libya and that they actually had no intention to travel to Europe. Although Libya was planned to be their final

the peak levels of last year.
There are several reasons that contributed
to increased migration along this route. First,
improved weather conditions made the Central Mediterranean more navigable. Second,
the presence of a large number of sub-Saharan Africans in the coastal areas of Libya
increased the migratory pressure. Third, the
increasingly unstable situation in Libya led
to a deteriorating security situation and increased violence, especially against sub-Saharan migrants. Libyan authorities currently
lack the ability to fully prevent the departure of boats from their coastline and to dismantle those facilitation networks that have
good organisational and logistical capacities.

In the second quarter of 2014, almost 51 000
persons were rescued in 274 rapid rescue operations undertaken by Italian authorities,
assets deployed through Frontex Joint Operations and civilian vessels. In spite of these
combined efforts, several tragic accidents
in overcrowded migrant boats leading to 83
fatalities could not be prevented. In one of
the worst cases, on 29 June, Italian authorities detected a wooden boat with 592 mi-

grants on board. When all of the migrants
had safely boarded the Italian vessels, more
than 60 migrants were discovered locked
on the lower deck of the wooden vessel together with 45 dead.
Moreover, Italy strengthened its maritime
presence in the Central Mediterranean
through a specific operation named Mare
Nostrum (Our Sea) since 18 October 2013. It
aims at controlling migrant flows through
increased surveillance and search-and-rescue (SAR) activities. Under Mare Nostrum
the Italian Navy deployed a number of ships
and other assets to the waters of the Sicily
Channel between Italy and Libya.
4.2.2. Apulia and Calabria
In the southern Italian regions of Apulia and
Calabria, detections of illegal border-crossing tend to be associated with two different
kinds of irregular migration. The majority of
detections in the area of Apulia are of secondary movements to Italy and migrants
who originally entered the Schengen area
in Greece, while most detections in Calabria
are of migrants who departed from Turkey
or Egypt and sailed across the Aegean Sea,
often near Crete, towards Italy to enter the
Schengen area for the first time.

After a lower number of detections reported
during the last winter, the number of detections in Q2 2014 was closer to the average
over the past few years. The most reported
nationality on this route were Syrians. Two
thirds departed from Egypt, primarily arriving in Calabria, while one third of the Syrians detected on this route departed from
Greece, mainly arriving in Apulia. The second
most predominant nationality on this route,
Pakistanis, primarily departed from Greece,
whilst some Afghan nationals also arrived
from Turkey in June.
4.2.3. Eastern Mediterranean route
The number of detected migrants who attempted to irregularly reach the EU along
the Eastern Mediterranean route in the second quarter of 2014 was almost twice as
high as during the second quarter of 2013.
Since the beginning of 2014, detections of illegal border-crossing have increased continuously, from 4 195 in Q1 to 8 767 in Q2 2014.
Because of seasonal reasons, the number of
migrants grew from 2 030 in April to 4 231 in
June, around 85% of whom were detected at
the sea border. Almost two thirds of the reported detections were related to Syrian nationals, whereas 20% and 5%, respectively, of
irregular migrants Afghan and Somali citizens.

The Eastern Mediterranean route has traditionally been a major hotspot for irregular
migration into the EU, predominantly associated with illegal border-crossings from Turkey. After early August 2012 at the Greek land
border and since November 2013 at the Bulgarian border, detections have been at much
lower levels following increased operational
activity in the area. However, total detection
numbers in June 2014 again reached the levels of 2009–2011.

Deadly accident near Samos
In the early morning of 5 May 2014, Frontex assets detected
two capsized boats, one yacht and one dinghy, close to the
north coast of Samos Island. A search and rescue operation
was launched, leading to the rescue of 36 persons (out of
which two were later identified as facilitators and 34 irregular migrants, mostly from Somalia). 22 corpses were recovered, among them many women and children.
Survivors indicated that the arrangements for the journey
were made in Istanbul, from where the whole group of 56
migrants was transported by bus to Cesme, in the province
of Izmir. On the night of 4 May 2014, the group embarked
aboard the yacht (see picture above) and started to navigate towards Samos. After sailing for two hours in rough
weather, the yacht started to take on water and the facilitators moved the migrants to the starboard side of the boat.
Inevitably, the yacht overturned and some migrants, mainly
women and children, were trapped underneath. Some of the
migrants rushed to the attached dinghy, which also capsized. Because of the early detection by Frontex assets
deployed in the area, it was possible to save the rest
of the group.

The marked decrease in detections observed
since August 2012 at particular border sections is due to a range of operational activities taking place in the region:
1.	In August 2012 the Greek authorities
launched operation Aspida, deploying additional manpower, assets and equipment
to the Evros region in order to curb and
tackle illegal migration. The enhanced surveillance and patrolling activities have resulted in a remarkable drop in the number
of apprehended irregular migrants in the
Evros region and have led to a displacement of the migration flow towards the
Bulgarian-Turkish border and the eastern
Aegean Sea. In addition to the operation
Aspida, the operation Xenios Zeus focused
on detecting migrants inland in urban areas around Athens.
2.	As a response to the increased pressure
at the Bulgarian-Turkish land border, the
Bulgarian authorities decided to implement an Integrated Border Surveillance
System (IBSS) to conduct enhanced air
surveillance, a special police operation and
to construct a 30 km long fence along vulnerable parts of the border.
3.	JO Poseidon Land 2014 was also active during Q2 2014 at the land border with Turkey.
The operation commenced on 26 March.
From 1 April to 30 June 2014, a total of 1 302
migrants were reported for crossing the
border illegally (869 migrants in the Bulgarian operational area and 433 migrants
in the Greek operational area), which rep-

resents a decrease compared to the same
reporting period of 2013, when 1 268 migrants were apprehended (1 054 migrants
in Bulgaria and 214 migrants in Greece).
Meetings between the Greek and Turkish
authorities take place on a monthly basis to allow for the exchange of relevant
data and information.
4.	Moreover, JO Poseidon Sea 2014 was operational during the reporting period in
order to tackle the flow of irregular migrants penetrating the external EU sea
borders in the eastern Mediterranean
mainly from Turkey and, to a lesser extent, from Egypt.

As can be seen in Figure 8, the abovementioned operational activities led to reduced
detections of illegal border-crossing in the
eastern Mediterranean region; however, in
the long term a displacement to the sea borders was observed. The fact that the overall number of illegal border-crossings on the
eastern Mediterranean route were higher
than in Q2 2013 can be attributed to the detections that were made in the Aegean Sea.
Eastern Aegean Sea
According to FRAN data from April to June
2014, more than 7 000 apprehensions of irregular migrants were reported from the

17 of 52

Frontex · FRAN Quarterly · q2 2014

The largest percentage increase concerned
Egyptian nationals, whose number grew 15fold and reached nearly 300. At the same
time, more than 1 500 Afghan nationals were
detected while trying to reach the Eastern
Aegean islands in Q2 2014, which represents
an increase by one third compared to one
year ago.
Concerning the location of interceptions,
roughly 75% were made inland on the Aegean islands and the rest at sea. In the 292
incidents detected through JO Poseidon Sea
during Q2 2014, the most targeted islands
have been Lesvos, Samos and Chios.
Measures at the Bulgarian land border
with Turkey
As a response to increased migration pressure
at the Bulgarian-Turkish land border, Bulgaria
has implemented a combination of measures.
On 1 July 2012, the Bulgarian authorities initiated the construction of an Integrated Border Surveillance System (IBSS) along with
enhanced air surveillance which has been
ongoing since October 2012. Through a special police operation launched on 11 November 2013 additional police and border police
officers have been deployed to the Bulgarian-Turkish land border.
On 24 October 2013, the Bulgarian authorities
started the construction of a 30 km technical engineering obstacle in the border areas
which are most affected by illegal migration.
It was completed by the end of July 2014 (see
Fig. 9) and it can be assumed its construction
will lead to a displacement of the migratory

eastern Aegean Sea. During Q2 2014, the
number of migrants detected in this area has
been far higher than during the same season in previous years. One reason for this
trend is the displacement of irregular migrants from the Bulgarian and Greek land
borders with Turkey.

Figure 9. Bulgarian-Turkish border between
Lesovo and Kraynovo

flow towards the areas which are not covered by the surveillance system. In addition to
these measures, regular bilateral joint meetings take place under an agreement signed
between Bulgaria and Turkey.
During Q4 2013, the reported detections at
the Bulgarian land border to Turkey reached
their highest level since FRAN data collection
began. Until Q2 2014, the abovementioned
measures reduced detections of irregular
migrants at the land border by 85%. Almost
three quarters of the detected migrants were
of Syrian and 20% of Afghan nationality.
4.2.4. Western Mediterranean route
In Q2 2014 there were close to 1 500 detections of illegal border-crossing in the western Mediterranean region, which consists of
several areas of the southern Spanish coast
as well as the land borders of Ceuta and Melilla. This was around a 19% decrease compared to the first quarter of the year due to

More than half of the migrants reported on
this route in Q2 2014 attempted to illegally
cross into Melilla or Ceuta. This figure was
considerably lower than in Q1 and only slightly
lower than a year ago. Ceuta and Melilla are
preferred destinations because they do not
require the costly involvement of a facilitation network. The massive crossing attempts
by sub-Saharan migrants that were reported
from Ceuta and Melilla are most effective
with the participation of a high number of
migrants. Reports indicate that attempts to
cross the security fences at the border in Melilla are not organised and are instead usually triggered when migrants realise that the
border patrols are not in the field or are less
numerous than normal.
In Q2 2014, around one half of those migrants
apprehended during attempts to enter Ceuta
and Melilla illegally were Cameroonian nationals. The second and third most frequently
detected nationalities attempting irregular
entry into Ceuta and Melilla were Guineans
and Malians, while the number of apprehended Algerians decreased substantially.
At the sea border, the proportion of migrants
detected while trying to cross the Strait of
Gibraltar was reported to have increased
again to around 45% of all apprehensions
reported from the Western Mediterranean
route. Around 80% of the reported irregular migrants were nationals of sub-Saharan countries.
Simple inflatable boats are used by many
migrants who intend to reach Europe (see
Fig. 10).

lower numbers from the land border. Compared to Q2 2013, the number of detections
increased by nearly 150 persons. Taking all
second quarters since 2009 into perspective,
the level of irregular migration registered during Q2 2014 along this route corresponded to
the reported average.

Figure 1o. Typical toy rubber boat used
by migrants to cross the sea border from
Morocco to Spain

The close proximity of Spain to Morocco as
well as the affordability of these types of
boats encourage this option. In fact, however this crossing is very dangerous. As a
result, many migrants then have to be rescued by the Spanish Search and Rescue services (SASEMAR).
One such incident took place on 15 June at
around 23:30 hrs, when a boat with sixtyeight irregular migrants was detected by
SASEMAR about 40 miles from Alboran Island. The Spanish Search and Rescue services intercepted the boat and rescued the
migrants. The migrants were then transferred to the port of Motril, where they received medical assistance from the Red Cross.
There were 68 people on board the boat and
it was not possible to identify any facilitators
or the captain of the boat.
4.2.5. Western African route
In the second quarter of 2014, over 100 detections of illegal border-crossing were reported
from this region. Although this represents a
more than threefold increase compared to
one year ago, the level of detections is still
far lower than in 2009, when many more
persons were apprehended. The majority of
the persons detected during the reporting
period were Malian nationals.

19 of 52

Frontex · FRAN Quarterly · q2 2014

In spite of minor peaks during the summer of
2013 and in the current reporting period, irregular migration on the West African route
has been significantly lower after 2009. Of
key importance for maintaining the low numbers of detections at the border are sustained
high levels of surveillance (ensuring early detections) and collaboration with third-country authorities.
4.2.6. Western Balkan route
During the analysed period there were 2 647
detections of illegal border-crossing at the
EU border to the Western Balkan countries,
which represents a more than 10% decrease
compared to the previous quarter, and a sharp
70% drop compared to the corresponding period of last year.
In Q2 2014, the Hungarian-Serbian border
section remained the busiest in terms of illegal border-crossings. In the analysed quarter,
this border section registered a 15% decrease
compared with the previous quarter and a
73% drop compared to the peak recorded in
the same period of 2013.

* This designation is
without prejudice to
positions on status, and is
in line with UNSCR 1244
and the ICJ Opinion on
the Kosovo declaration of
independence.

As regards to nationalities detected at the
Hungarian border with Serbia, the top three
remains the same as in the previous two
quarters. Afghan nationals still rank first;
however, in Q2 2014 Kosovo* citizens moved
to the second place outpacing Syrians, who
now rank third. Although the overall numbers
at this border section decreased, the composition of the flow still indicates continued
secondary movements from Greece/Turkey
through the Western Balkans and onwards
to EU Member States.
As regards to nationalities detected on the
Western Balkan route, most were Afghan
nationals in transit from Greece and Turkey
(719), while 708 were Western Balkan nationals, mostly from Kosovo*, 478 were Syrian migrants. In Q2 2014, detections of both

20 of 52

Afghan and Syrian nationals decreased compared to the first quarter of 2014. The number
of Pakistani migrants remained rather stable
during the second quarter, reaching around
50 detections. An increase in the number of
Iraqi migrants can be noticed compared to
the first quarter of 2014 but the overall figures still remain at a low level.
The overall number of West Africans remained stable compared to the previous
quarter with increased detections of some
nationalities (for example Nigerians from 15
to 59) and decreases in others. In total however, the number of West African migrants
is lower than in the corresponding quarter
of 2013. This may be partly due to a possible
re-routing of these nationalities towards the
central Mediterranean area.
4.2.7. Circular migration from Albania to
Greece
Prior to being granted visa free access to the
Schengen area in late 2010, Albanians were
regularly detected in very high numbers illegally crossing their land border into Greece.
Since visa liberalisation, Albanians are still
detected illegally crossing the border into
Greece but at a lower level. Moreover, there
was a high level of refusals of entry (mostly
for having an alert in the SIS) and also document fraud (counterfeit border-crossing
stamps to fabricate travel histories and extend periods of stay in the Schengen area).
In Q2 2014, detections of Albanians at the
Greek-Albanian border increased by almost
50% compared to the last quarter, which
points to continued circular migration at this
border. Likewise, detections of Albanians at
the Greece-FYR Macedonia border increased
by more than 150%. Refusals of entry of Albanians at these border sections are on a similar level as in Q2 2013, but increased by 63%
since Q1 2014. Effective returns of Albanians

© Frontex, 2014

Figure 11. Migrants hiding in a lorry to cross the border from Turkey to Bulgaria

decreased in Q2 2014 by 5% compared to the
same period of 2013.
4.2.8. Eastern land borders route
The eastern land borders route represents a
combination of detections of illegal bordercrossing reported from the land borders of
Lithuania, Slovakia, Romania, Hungary, Poland, Estonia, Finland and Latvia. Despite the
total length of all the border sections, detections tend to be lower than on other routes
– possibly due to the long distances between
major hubs and countries of origin and a long
stretches of impassable terrain.
In the second quarter 2014 there were 218
illegal border-crossings reported from the
eastern borders, which represented a stable
trend when compared with the first quarter
of 2014 (189) and a drop of 37% when compared to the corresponding period of 2013.
However, there was a decrease in detections
at all border sections with Ukraine. The drop
in detections was reported from both sides of
the border: by Member States and Ukraine.
A significant drop was recorded especially in
detections of Afghan nationals (Slovakia) and
Syrians (Romania, Hungary, Poland).
Regarding nationalities, the top five were
nationals of Afghanistan, Ukraine, Georgia,
Vietnam, and the Russian Federation. Simi-

larly to the previous quarter, Ukrainians were
reported mainly at the borders with Romania and Poland.
Similarly to the first quarter of 2014, detections of the vast majority of Ukrainian citizens
were related to smuggling rather than to migration purposes. In contrast, for the majority
of Georgians, Afghans and Russians the purpose of illegal border-crossing between BCPs
was linked to irregular migration.

4.3. Clandestine entry
Restricting the FRAN indicator on detections
of illegal border-crossing at BCPs (1B) to the
external land and sea borders of the EU and
to detections confirmed to be clandestine
entries (e.g. hiding in means of transport),
results in relatively low detections for the
whole of the EU compared with other indicators of irregular migration. In Q2 2014, 624
detections were reported at EU level, which
is almost twice as many as in Q1 2014.
Most of the detections of clandestine entry
in the second quarter of 2014 were reported
from Bulgaria, which was the largest number of clandestine entries reported by that
country since FRAN data collection began.
All incidents were related to the country’s
land border with Turkey. This increase in detections of clandestine entry at this border

21 of 52

Frontex · FRAN Quarterly · q2 2014

section is likely to be linked to the strengthened surveillance along the land border with
Turkey that triggered facilitators to find alternative ways into the EU.
Compared to Q1 2014, detections of clandestine entry reported by Croatia – all at
its land border with Serbia – decreased to a
small extent. Considerable lorry traffic goes
through this border section, and is particularly used for international traffic from the
Western Balkans countries to the EU, but
also as a transit corridor for TIR traffic from
Turkey to western EU Member States. Hiding in lorries and trains represents considerable risks for migrants’ lives, in particular due
to the threat of suffocation. Most of the migrants were Syrians, and it is likely that they
had initially crossed the border illegally from
Turkey and were in transit to their final destination within the EU when detected by the
Croatian border-control authorities.

4.4. Detections of facilitators
After five years of decreasing detections of
facilitators of irregular migration, numbers
have recently been rising again. More facilitators were arrested, although facilitation networks showed increasingly cautious
behaviour. A widespread shift towards the
abuse of legal channels and document fraud
have allowed facilitators to operate remotely
and inconspicuously rather than accompanying migrants during high-risk activities
such as border-crossings. On the other hand,
the expanded logistical and organisational
structures of the facilitation networks and
the increased capacities to transport migrants across the Mediterranean Sea and
Europe’s land borders apparently led to a
greater exposure of these criminal groups
to police investigations and consequently
to more arrests.
During the second quarter of this year FRAN
data shows 2 641 detections of facilitators of

22 of 52

irregular migration, 30% more than during
the previous quarter and around 50% more
than in Q2 2013. The top five Member States
(Spain, Italy, France, Greece and Switzerland)
reported more than 80% of the detections.
The fact that most facilitators were arrested
by Mediterranean countries may indicate that
more complex sea border-crossings require
more involvement from local facilitation networks. Since Q2 2013, the number of arrested
facilitators from Mediterranean countries has
increased by 50%.
In accordance with the rapidly increased detection numbers of Eritreans illegally crossing
the EU external borders, also more Eritrean
facilitators were arrested. While before 2014,
Member States regularly reported less than
20 facilitators from Eritrea per quarter, their
number grew to 85 in Q2 2014.

4.5. Detections of illegal stay
In Q2 2014, there were 100 647 detections of
illegal stay in the EU, which is an increase of
15% compared to last quarter and 22% more
than one year ago (Fig. 12). Since 2009, reported levels of detections have always been
clearly below 100 000. In terms of nationalities reported through this indicator, Syrians ranked first, reaching another peak in
Q2 2014 with 14 753 detections. Similar to
the detections of illegal border-crossings and
asylum applications, the number of Syrians
detected staying illegally has risen sharply
from mid-2013, as a consequence of people escaping the enduring armed conflict
in their country.
The largest increase of this indicator was related to Eritreans, of whom 12 082 were reported for illegal stay, a number that is more
than five times as high as in Q1 2014 and more
than 12 times as high as one year ago in Q2
2013. If all nationalities from the Horn of Africa
are grouped together, the reported numbers

Figure 12. The highest percentage increases in the number of detected illegal stayers were reported by Sweden, Malta
and Bulgaria

of illegal stay would add up to nearly 15 000
migrants during Q2 2014.
Other nationalities that were detected in significant numbers included Moroccans (6 064),
Albanians (4 655), and Afghans (3 700).

As has been the case since Q4 2012, Germany
reported the largest number of detections
of illegal stay, consisting of mainly Syrians.
However, the 50% growth of this indicator
since Q1 2014 (representing the largest increase between two consecutive quarters
so far) was mainly caused by Eritreans, re-

23 of 52

Frontex · FRAN Quarterly · q2 2014

ported for illegal stay around 11 times more
often than in the previous quarter. Since Q1
2010, the detections of illegal stay in Germany
have grown threefold, making Germany by
far the most popular destination country for
illegal migration within the EU.
The Member State with the second highest number of detections of illegal stay was
Sweden, which reported 80% more illegal
stayers than in the previous quarter. This
upward trend was mostly related to an increase in asylum applicants, which are additionally counted as illegal stayers by Sweden.
The Member States, which reported the largest downward trend in illegal stay were the
neighbours Bulgaria and, to a lesser extent,
Romania, where detections decreased by
more than 50% since last quarter. The lower
number of Syrians detected for illegal stay
was to a large extent related to operational
activities at the Bulgarian land border with
Turkey.

4.6. Refusals of entry
In Q2 2014 26 823 refusals of entry were reported from the EU external borders. This
represents only a slight increase of 7% since
last quarter. However, compared to one
year ago the reported number of refusals
decreased by 30%. For one part, this downward trend was caused by a decrease in refusals of entry at the land borders in Poland,
in particular those refusals issued to Russians
and to a lesser extent Georgians at the land
border with Belarus. The refusals of entry
issued by Poland to Russian nationals during Q2 2014 reached only 15% of the number
reported one year ago. In this context, the
most mentioned reason given to the traveller was ‘no valid visa’.
This reduction follows a two-year phenomenon that consisted in a large number of
Chechens being refused entry at the BCP of

24 of 52

Terespol and then applying for asylum so as
to continue to other Member States, mostly
Germany. A series of measures including media campaigns in Chechnya introduced by
Germany and Poland managed to curb this
type of irregular migration. However, the Polish border sections with Ukraine and Belarus
remained the ones with most refusals of entry issued in Q2 2014.
In general, refusals issued to Ukrainians
showed a clear increase during Q2 2014,
since the number reached a low during last
winter. The most often given reasons were
‘no valid visa’ or ‘no appropriate documentation justifying the purpose and conditions of stay’.
Not only Poland but also other countries
in the north-east of Europe have reported
lower numbers of refusals compared to the
second quarter of 2013 (Fig. 13). Since then,
the Baltic countries and Finland together
nearly halved the number of refusals issued
to Russians in Q2 2014. Also worth mentioning is the number of refusals issued by
Estonia – which went down to only a handful in 2014.
More than 11 500 refusals were reported
from EU/Schengen airports, with the reason mostly being ‘no appropriate documentation justifying the purpose and conditions
of stay’. Most refusal decisions were issued in Paris Charles de Gaulle and London Heathrow. At airports, entry was most
frequently refused to Albanians, Algerians,
and Brazilians.
The number of refusals of entry issued to nationals of the visa-free Western Balkan countries increased both compared to last quarter
and the second quarter of 2013. Most were
refused entry because of a Schengen alert issued, because of no sufficient means of subsistence and ‘no appropriate documentation
justifying the purpose and conditions of stay’.

Figure 13. In spite of a substantial decrease, Poland continued to refuse entry to more third-country citizens than any
other Member State. The most concerned nationals were Ukrainians, Russians and Belarusians

Most of these refusals were issued at the border between Hungary and Serbia, Greece and
Albania, and Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina.
In general, by far the two main reasons for
refusals of entry in the EU were ‘no valid
visa’ and ‘has no appropriate documenta-

tion justifying the purpose of stay’. Together
they represented nearly half of all refusals
of entry in the second quarter of 2014 and
these two reasons have ranked first since
data collection has began.

4.7. Asylum claims
In the second quarter of 2014, the number of
asylum seekers crossed the mark of 100 000
applications and reached 113 312, the largest
number since FRAN data collection began.
The indicator increased by 20% compared to
the previous quarter, representing the strongest quarterly increase in absolute numbers
since 2009. Compared to the second quarter of 2013, the figure of asylum applications
grew by 32%.
Both in terms of percentage and absolute
numbers, Italy was the Members State which
registered the largest increase in asylum applications (Fig. 14). Since Q2 2013, the figure
increased almost sixfold. The largest share of
asylum seekers reported by Italy was Malian
(22%), followed by Nigerian (16%) and Pakistani nationals (10%).
Italy together with Germany, which again reported the largest number of applications in
the EU, and Sweden, which registered a record asylum figure since FRAN data collection
began in 2007, account for 60% of all asylum
seekers reported by Member States. In Germany and Sweden, Syrians and Eritreans are
the most prevalent nationality amongst the
asylum seekers.
Compared to last quarter, the number of Eritrean migrants seeking international protection in the Netherlands increased ninefold,
while Syrian asylum applications doubled.
These developments made the Netherlands
one of the most growing EU asylum destinations during the last quarter.
In general, Syrians continued to be the number one nationality seeking international protection in the EU, submitting in the second
quarter of 2014 almost 25% more asylum applications than in Q1 2014. The nationality
with the fastest growing number of asylum

26 of 52

seekers were Eritreans, whose applications
rose by about 274% between Q1 and Q2 2014.
Western Balkan nationals, whose asylum applications used to have their seasonal low in
the first half of the year continued to apply
for international protection in large numbers. Although the figure reported in Q2 2014
is 15% smaller than in the previous quarter,
it is the highest value of all second quarters
since FRAN data collection began. Almost
three quarter of their asylum applications
were submitted in Germany.

4.8. Document fraud
As in the previous quarter, in Q2 2014 there
were just over 2 300 detections of document fraud on entry to the EU/Schengen area
from third countries, which is also roughly
the same as during the previous year in Q2.
Omitting the data from Switzerland, which
started reporting in 2014 and the numbers
from the new EU Member State Croatia,
which only began reporting after June 2013,
reports of document fraud would have been
in decline.
Spain, France, Italy and Hungary reported the
most detections of entry at the external border, together accounting for more than 60%
of all detections at the EU level. Spanish detections were mostly related to attempted
entries from Morocco.
Since last quarter, French authorities experienced a 20% hike in the detections of document fraud on entry from third countries.
Italy reported an increase in the detections of
document fraud related to both Q1 2014 and
the second quarter of 2013.
Hungary reported the largest number of document fraud cases of any second quarter
since the EDF data collection started. However, compared to the previous quarter, doc-

ument fraud figures remained stable. 40% of
all cases were related to South-East European nationals and a quarter to Ukrainians.
These cases were predominantly related to
detections at the land border.

At the EU level, of the 124 nationalities detected using fraudulent documents to illegally
enter the EU or Schengen area from a third
county, the most commonly detected were
from Syria, Albania and Nigeria. Syrians were
detected at a range of locations but Albanians were mostly apprehended on entry to

27 of 52

Frontex · FRAN Quarterly · q2 2014

Greece and Nigerians were mostly detected
at the airports of London, Rome and Madrid.
See the following sections for more details.
4.8.1. Document fraud on exit from the
EU/Schengen area
The number of persons using fraudulent documents on exit (650) shows a slight decrease
both compared to last quarter and one year
ago. Around a fifth of detections were on exit
but this is likely to be an underestimation as
checks are less stringent on exit than they
are on entry. In fact some Member States
do not perform exit checks. On the other
hand, a number of Member States reported
that a third or more of their cases were on
exit, such as Croatia, Finland, France, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia and Switzerland. Romania and Slovakia detected more document
fraudsters on exit than on entry.
4.8.2. Between the Schengen area and
non-Schengen EU Member States
As well as at the external border, it is also
important that at the EU level there were
over 750 detections of document fraud between the Schengen area and non-Schengen EU Member States, and between two
non-Schengen EU Member States. As is normally the case, many of these were reported
on entry to the UK, a common destination
country for irregular migrants travelling from
the Schengen area. In this case, by far the
most commonly detected migrants were
from Albania.
4.8.3. Intra-Schengen flights

* http://news.sky.com/
story/1290780/illegalimmigrant-smugglingracket-smashed

28 of 52

The EDF-RAN data exchange also considers detections of document fraud on intra-Schengen flights (and to a minor extent
ferry connections) where no border checks
are systematically performed. Since the EDF
data collection began, intra-Schengen detections have been showing modest highs

during the spring and summer season, while
during most winter months, less detections
were reported. In the second quarter of 2014,
1 569 detections of document fraud on intra-Schengen flights were reported, which
are more than twice as many as during the
previous quarter.
Apart from the seasonal fluctuations, detection numbers reported during the last three
years showed a rather upward tendency,
which intensified after Q3 2013. One year
ago, the number of intra-Schengen detections reached only 50% of the current level.
4.8.4. Migrants from Syria
Overall, 981 Syrians were detected using
fraudulent documents in Q2 2014. After a
temporary low of 566 Syrians who were detected in the previous quarter, the number
appears to have returned and even exceeds
the unusually high level that was reported
by the end of 2013. Syrians were mostly detected on entry to the Schengen area from
third countries, followed by intra-Schengen
travel, which suggests that many are illegally crossing the external border and then
using fraudulent documents for secondary
movements.
4.8.5. Migrants from Albania
In Q2 2014, 635 Albanians were detected using
more than 677 fraudulent documents (excluding authentic passports containing fraudulent
documents such as visas or stamps), which
is a decrease compared to both the previous
quarter and Q2 2013. Nevertheless, Albanians
represent the second biggest proportion of
document fraud at the EU level.
According to media reports* published in June
2014, UK authorities have disbanded an international gang smuggling hundreds of illegal immigrants from Albania through Turkey
and Rome into Britain using fake documents.

The criminals demanded between EUR 6 000
and 10 000 from their ‘customers’ for identity
cards with substituted photographs.
4.8.6. Migrants from the Horn of Africa
Nearly 90% of all incidents related to this region’s nationals are detected during secondary movements after illegal entry into the EU.
In general, Member States reported 591 cases
of document fraud committed by Eritrean
nationals in Q2 2014, which is a threefold
increase compared to the previous quarter.
189 Somali and 25 Ethiopians were detected
with fraudulent documents, an increase of
38 and 19, respectively, compared to Q1 2014.
4.8.7. Migrants from Ukraine
The political crisis and armed conflict in
Ukraine has not shown any substantial effect on the reported cases of document fraud.
Ukrainians that were detected by Member
State authorities with fraudulent travel documents tended to follow the overall seasonal
trend of all other nationalities. At the EU external land borders, most incidents were reported from Polish and Hungarian BCPs.
4.8.8. Migrants from Sri Lanka
For one year, Sri Lankans arriving at Schengen airports with fraudulent documents
have been steadily increasing. Between the
second quarter of 2013 and the current reporting period, their reported number has
been growing from 34 to 113.

4.9. Returns
4.9.1. Return decisions and effective
returns
In Q2 2014 there were 60 491 third-country
nationals subject to an obligation to leave
the EU as a result of an administrative or judicial decision, which is 6% less than during

the previous quarter. Note that the absolute
total number of migrants subject to return
decisions is still underestimated by this indicator, as data on decisions were unavailable from, inter alia, France, the Netherlands
and Sweden, where it is assumed that high
numbers of decisions were reached. As for
Q1 and Q2 2014, the reported total does not
include data from Austria for technical reasons. Moreover, Spanish data on return orders issued have been revised by the Spanish
authorities and due to this change numbers
for Q1 2014 were retroactively lowered.
40 724 effective returns were reported by
Member States in Q2 2014, 10% more than
during the previous quarter. For this indicator, Austrian data for this period were not yet
available at the time of writing due to technical reasons.
At the Member State level there is often a
discrepancy between the number of return
decisions reached and the number of effective returns carried out. Some of the differences may be due to time lags between
judicial decisions and physical returns, while
other differences may be due to the disappearance of migrants once a decision has
been reached.
In Bulgaria, both return decisions and effective returns decreased between Q1 and Q2
2014. The rather extraordinary peak reported
in the first quarter of 2014 was caused by a
particularly large number of illegal bordercrossings in the second half of 2013. Considering this temporary phenomenon, both return
indicators of Q1 2014 showed to be far higher
than the quarterly average in 2013.
Nevertheless, in general, most return decisions (5 311) were related to Syrian nationals,
decreasing by 15% since Q1 2014. Moroccans
ranked second, with return decisions increasing by more than 500 since the previous quarter to 5 185 in Q2 2014.

4.10. Other illegal activities at
the border
Criminal networks that operate across the
EU external borders pose a significant challenge to European law-enforcement authorities. They affect the overall management
of the external borders insofar as their prevention demands substantial personnel and
financial resources of the European border agencies.
4.10.1. Trafficking in human beings
Spanish authorities have identified patterns
of Nigerian women being trafficked to Spain
and Italy for both labour and sexual exploitation, and an increase in the sexual exploitation of children.

30 of 52

tion. However, with their role came the responsibility of generating their own level of
profit required as well as the profit of those
under their control.
These two sets of control methods would
likely bring about a much more solid organisation; with both the overarching psychological and intimidating control of the traffickers,
and the closer supervision and control of
those in a very similar situation to them. Although not explicitly stated, the chance for
the victim’s ‘promotion’ to being a controller would be a strong incentive for the victims to stay in line.
4.10.2. Smuggling of excise goods at the
eastern borders

These women are recruited on false pretences
(fictitious working arrangements) in Nigeria, and then mainly taken on two different
routes. One route is travelling from Nigeria
to Libya by land, and then moving onwards
by boat to Italy as their final destination. The
second is by travelling from Nigeria to Morocco by land, and from there attempting to
gain access to Spain. These women may also
be trafficked via commercial airlines using
forged/false documents – this method is also
the most expensive for the women, causing
them to go into a large amount of debt with
their exploiters.

The smuggling of cigarettes remained the
main cross-border crime observed at the
eastern borders. In the second quarter of
2014, the number of tobacco smuggling incidents reported through Frontex Joint Operations increased significantly when compared
to the first quarter of 2014. Border guards
reported 90 cases of cigarette contraband
through JO Focal Points Land, which accounted for over five times more incidents
than in the previous quarter. Almost half of
the detections took place at the border with
Moldova, while the borders with Ukraine and
the Russian Federation were nearly equally
affected by the number of incidents.

The authorities also noted specific methods
of enforcing emotional dependence on the
victims. Victims participated in ‘Voodoo’ rituals with oaths and written statements. These
often contained photographs, altars, candles and amulets, all with specific reference
to the victim. Another specific method employed was the use of certain victims to be
the controllers over the others. Whilst these
women picked to be ‘controllers’ were still
in heavy debt to the traffickers, they were
put in a slightly less disadvantageous posi-

Similarly to previous quarters, modi operandi
related to contraband cigarettes remained
unchanged with smuggling occurring at BCPs,
e.g. in personal belongings or in different
means of transportation in specially built hidden compartments or in the cargo, as well
as between BCPs via land borders or rivers.
Apart from cigarettes with excise stamps of
Ukraine, Belarus and the Russian Federation, cases of tobacco products transported
illegally from Kaliningrad Oblast (the Russian Federation) to Lithuania without any

Figure 15. Double bottom floor of SUV Isuzu Trooper fully equipped with illicit cigarettes
from Belarus

signs of excise duty stamps were reported
by Lithuania.
The shipment of illicit cigarettes hiding in
various parts of vehicles was detected on a
regular basis. Typical places for illegal transport of tobacco goods include car bumpers,
door, vehicles instrument panel, fuel tanks or
the air bag compartment.

The largest shipments of illicit cigarettes on
the eastern borders were reported in cargo
trains. Polish border guards faced several such
cases. As an example, on 2 April 2014 border
guards of BCP Terespol revealed over 1.2 million cigarettes worth almost EUR 170 000.
The goods with Belarusian excise stamps
were hidden under piles of wood.

Moreover, apprehensions of those caught
‘red-handed’ were also reported in the period
examined. Cases described by the Polish Border Guard and Lithuanian State Border Guard
Service indicated that at the Polish-Ukrainian
and Lithuanian-Belarusian borders smugglers
were detected carrying cigarettes packed
in cardboard boxes attached with braces as
shown in Figures 16 and 17.

Figure 16. Cigarettes smuggled via land
border from Belarus in wrapped boxes

Contraband cigarettes were also detected by
border patrols at land border sections. Cardboard boxes wrapped in black plastic were
often left alone in the forest or on the river
bank to be later transported inland. For example, about 37 500 packets of cigarettes
were found inside of a small truck abandoned
by perpetrators in the forest near the border
with Lithuania.

© Lithuanian State Border Guard Service

The use of double bottom constructions,
in turn, still seemed to be less frequently
used, but for larger amounts. Lithuanian border guards, as an example, revealed in April
15 000 packets of cigarettes originating from
Belarus and hidden in a cargo compartment
below the floor.

area of unloading port near BCP Terespol

Smuggling via rivers was still a risk in the second quarter of 2014. Well known modus operandi such as cigarettes left alone either on
the river banks or in floating boats were repeated continuously. Moldovan border police, for example, on 27 of May 2014 revealed
3 123 packets of cigarettes inside an inflatable
pontoon drifting on the river Prut.

Interestingly, in line with better weather conditions the use of diving suits for smuggling
was recorded. On June 25, 2014 Lithuanian
border guards detained a person dressed in
a diving suit about 300 meters from the border with Belarus. Nearby the river, a shipment
of 750 packets of cigarettes with Belarusian
excise stamps was found.

In Estonia, illegal cigarettes made up
18.6% of the market last year, down
by 1.1 percentage points compared to
2012. Latvia (28.8%), Lithuania (27.1%)
and Ireland (21.1%) were the only Member States with higher shares. The EU’s
average was 10.5 %, which was slightly
lower than a year ago. The total of close
to 60 billion pieces of illegal cigarettes
purchased in the EU in 2013 translates
into around EUR 11 billion in unpaid tax.
Most of the contraband cigarettes in Estonia hail from the Russian Federation
or Belarus, and around half are produced solely for the illegal market.

4.10.3. Drug trafficking

As before, cocaine accounted for a large percentage of seizures in Western Europe. All recorded cases originated from South America,
with Ecuador being the main country of origin, followed by Columbia. Spain remained the
top destination for large shipments (>1 000 kg
per seizure) whilst Portugal and Italy both
caught several significant hauls of between
100–200 kg.
During the month of May 2014, a number of
cocaine shipments were seized on their way
from Costa Rica to Spain, with nearly 4.5
tonnes seized in a 24 hour window.
One incident involved a shipment of 1.9 metric tonnes which was being smuggled on two
fishing boats. A second involved 2.5 tonnes
which was hidden amongst pineapples; the
cocaine was divided up into 2 296 packages
and hidden amongst the fruit. The haul would
have had a street value of roughly 150 million
Euros, and led to the arrest of six Spanish nationals. These were the largest recorded seizures originating from Costa Rica, and may
indicate an increased shipping capacity from
that region.
A small number of larger shipments were also
caught in the Netherlands, Britain, France and
Germany. These were often hidden alongside
legitimate products and all originated from
South American countries. Across Western
Europe a number of smaller seizures (40–
50 kg) were made, which mostly appeared
to be acts of opportunity by travellers or
smaller vessels.
Continuing from past trends, a steady stream
of hashish was detected from Morocco to
Spain, with little change from previous years.
Greece has also seen a number of Hashish seizures at sea, although with relatively small

weight in comparison to the hauls from Morocco to Spain. The Morocco/Spain route
seems unlikely to change, even with a number of high profile seizures. Seizures involving Moroccan nationals usually involved small
amounts carried either on the person (under
clothing), by ingestion or by land vehicle. Seizures involving Spanish nationals were usually larger shipments moved via boat with a
land vehicle at the arrival point to continue
onwards.

Poseidon Sea seizure
On 23 June, aircraft deployed under the JO Poseidon Sea operation detected two suspicious vessels in the area of Marathoupoleos, Greece. A Hellenic Coast Guard vessel arrived
in the area and following a pursuit seized a speed boat laden
with cigarettes from a variety of brands. The cargo ship,
also laden with cigarettes, was seized after a pursuit with
6 Ukrainian crew members on board, while a lorry used for
transporting the cigarettes was found abandoned in the
coastal area. Hellenic Coast Guard officers arrested three
smugglers involved in the incident, and following an investigation, arrested a further 6 members of the smuggling network. In total, 12 934 980 pieces of cigarettes
were seized, representing a potential loss of duty of
up to EUR 2 million.

The future threat of khat

Albanian marijuana seized in Bari

The UK’s recent move to illegalise khat (also known as qat,
chat and gat) may lead to more incidents of smuggling in
Western Europe due to the UK’s large (largest in Europe by
most estimates) Somali diasporas. Previously, Khat was legal in the UK, which was seen as a main route (and easiest border) into the rest of Europe, where Khat was already
criminalised. Furthermore, evidence and convictions of large
scale Khat smuggling rings in the US and other countries
where it was already criminalised show that an organised
crime framework for trafficking the drug is already in place.

The Guardia di Finanza and officials of the
Customs Agency, as part of the checks
carried out within the port to counter
the introduction of the illegal goods from
Eastern Europe, seized 1 350 kg of marijuana. Hidden inside of a cargo cover,
composed of cement used in the construction industry. The driver of the vehicle, an Albanian aged 55, was arrested.

Whilst it is unclear which borders will be most affected, the
plant is mostly grown in the Red Sea region and is a major
cash crop in Ethiopia, Kenya and Yemen. Without the easier route into Europe through the UK, the same routes
used for hashish smuggling (Morocco/Spain) may become more popular.

Croatia’s biggest marijuana haul

Very few instances of heroin trafficking were
found, however one major seizure was made
by the Netherlands of 764 kg coming from
Iran. The drugs were hidden in a container
filled with 2 000 boxes of raisins from Iran,
which was seized at Rotterdam port. The final destination of the container was either
Greece or Bulgaria, from which it is probably distributed onwards to the surrounding countries.
Drug trafficking in the Balkans
The main routes were from Montenegro, Albania and Bosnia-Herzegovina towards Croatia, with a number of seizures being made in
the Adriatic Sea between Albania and Italy.

Police in Croatia seized more than 800 kg
of marijuana smuggled over the Adriatic
Sea from Albania in a fishing boat. Police
said that the seizure is one of the biggest ever in the country. They say the
drugs’ value was estimated at some EUR
1.3 million (USD 1.8 million). The statement says eight Croatian and two Bosnian citizens have been detained, while
the boat owner from Albania remains at
large. Police say the drugs were placed in
700 packages for distribution in Croatia and in Western Europe.

cles and there were indicators in a number
of cases that the drug’s final destination was
the Western Mediterranean.
4.10.4. Vehicle theft
Smuggling of vehicles at the eastern
borders
In the second quarter of 2014 the number of
detected vehicles reported through Frontex
Joint Operations increased when compared to
the previous quarter. 85 stolen vehicles have
been prevented from crossing the border in

Q2 2014. Most incidents reported through
JO Focal Points Land, were detected at the
border with Ukraine and to the lesser extend with Belarus, Moldova and the Russian Federation.
According to JO Focal Points Land, the PolishUkraine border section was the most affected
one by the phenomenon of stolen vehicles,
followed by the Ukrainian border with Hungary, Belarusian border with Poland and the
Moldovan border with Romania.
As reported detected stolen vehicles were
originating from different Member States
such as: Germany, Poland, Italy, Spain, Austria, the Netherlands and the UK. BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen, Honda and Audi were still
the top five most trafficked makes.
Smuggling of vehicles at the Western Balkan borders
In the second quarter of 2014 the number of
detected stolen vehicles reported through
Frontex Joint Operations increased by 46%
when compared to the previous quarter. 47
stolen vehicles were prevented from crossing
the border in Q2, compared to only 32 detections in the first quarter of 2014. Similarly to
the first quarter, the majority of cases were
recorded at the Serbian border, namely at
the border with Hungary and Croatia. Bulgaria-Turkey and Croatia-Montenegro border sections were affected to a lesser extent.

4.11. Passenger flow
Since January 2014, Member States have been
invited to regularly report on passenger flows
at their external borders under FRAN. Their
reporting is not yet comprehensive and thus
it is not yet possible to have an EU-wide
overview of passenger flow across the external borders at the EU level. Nevertheless,
some limited analyses are possible and presented here.

Table 2. Q2 2014 saw more entries at both air and land borders than
Q1, reflecting increased passenger flows during the holiday season

4.11.1. At the air borders
At the air borders, one of the main difficulties for most Schengen Member States is to
distinguish between the flow of passengers
entering from third-countries and those entering from a non-Schengen Member States.
Some Member States merged both flows,
while others reported only arrivals from
third-countries.
In Q2, 15 Member States (compared to 7 for
Q1 2014) reported entries from third-countries and non-Schengen Member States for
all three months, summing up more than 33
million passenger arrivals. This was an increase of about 40% compared to Q1, mostly
due to the start of the holiday season which
usually shows a peak around August.
For these Member States, quarterly arrivals
were compared with refusals of entry and
detections of document fraud on entry from
third-countries or between Schengen and
non-Schengen Member States. As passenger-flows vary widely among these Member States (more than 15 million in France,
and less than 4 000 in Slovakia), comparisons among Member States were made on
the basis of a rate, in this case the number of
refusals of entry or document fraud detections for every 100 000 entries.
On average, these Member States refused
entry to 14 travellers for every 100 000 entries. Generally speaking, Member States
with low passenger flow tend to have a large
ratio of refusals.

35 of 52

% change

Frontex · FRAN Quarterly · q2 2014

Detections for document fraud varied widely,
from zero to 41 detections per 100 000 arrivals. It should be noted here that only detections made on arrivals from third-countries or
between Schengen and non-Schengen Member States were taken into account.
4.11.2. At the land border
At the land border, data on passengers arriving from third-countries were available
for seven Member States, totalling about 8.5
million passengers in Q2 2014. Like at the air
border, passenger flow increased between Q1

36 of 52

and Q2, mostly associated with the summer
season which usually shows a peak in August.
On average, these Member States refused
entry to 114 travellers for every 100 000 entries, which was much higher than at the
air border. Also, in contrast to the air border,
the larger passenger flow at the land border
corresponded to a greater number of refusals of entry.
Detections for document fraud per 100 000
passengers was comparable to the detection
rate at the air borders, with about 3 detections per 100 000 passengers.

Sources and Methods
For the data concerning detections at the external borders, some of the border types are
not applicable to all FRAN Member States.
This pertains to data on all FRAN indicators
since the data are provided disaggregated
by border type. The definitions of detections
at land borders are therefore not applicable (excluding borders with non-Schengen
principalities) for Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Iceland,
Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland and
the UK. For Cyprus, the land border refers to
the Green Line demarcation with the area
not under the effective control of the government of the Republic of Cyprus. For sea
borders, the definitions are not applicable for
land-locked Member States including Austria,
the Czech Republic, Hungary, Luxembourg,
Slovakia and Switzerland.
In addition, data on detections of illegal border-crossing at land, air and sea BCPs (1B) are
not available for Iceland, Ireland and Spain
and in Greece (these detections are included
in the data for Indicator 1A). Data for Norway only includes detections of illegal border-crossing at land and sea BCPs (1B), not
between BCPs (1A).
In Italy, detections of illegal border-crossing
at sea BCPs are only reported for intra-EU
border-crossing from Greece. Data on detections of illegal border-crossing between
sea BCPs (1A) are not available for Ireland.
Data on apprehension (FRAN Indicator 2) of
facilitators is not available for Ireland. For Italy, the data are not disaggregated by border
type, but are reported as total apprehensions (not specified). Data for Italy and Norway also include the facilitation of illegal stay
and work. For Romania, the data include

52 of 52

land intra-EU detections on exit at the border with Hungary.
For the data concerning detections of illegal stay (FRAN Indicator 3), data on detections at exit are not available for Denmark,
Ireland, Italy, Spain and the UK.
Data on refusals of entry (FRAN Indicator 4)
at the external EU borders are not disaggregated by reason of refusal for Ireland and
the UK. Refusals of entry at the Spanish land
borders at Ceuta and Melilla (without the issuance of a refusal form) are reported separately and are not included in the presented
FRAN data.
The data on applications for international
protection (FRAN Indicator 5) are not disaggregated by place of application (type of
border on entry or inland applications) for
Austria, the Czech Republic and Slovenia.
For these countries, only the total number
of applications is reported. For France, only
asylum applications at the external borders
are reported, not inland applications. For the
UK, data reported for applications at air BCPs
also include applications at sea BCPs.
The data on return decisions issued (FRAN
indicator 7A) are not available for Ireland,
France, The Netherlands and Sweden. The
data on effective returns (FRAN indicator
7B) are not available for Ireland. In addition,
the data of effective returns are not disaggregated by return operation (voluntary and
forced) for Spain. The data on voluntary effective returns (FRAN Indicator 7A) are not
disaggregated by type of return operation
(IOM assisted and others) for Belgium, Czech
Republic, Finland and the Netherlands. The
data on forced effective returns (FRAN Indicator 7A) are not disaggregated by type of return operation (enforced by Member Stated
and by Joint Operations) for Belgium, Finland,
Iceland and the Netherlands.
