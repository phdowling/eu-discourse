Frontex official publications fall into four main categories: risk analysis, training, operations
and research, each marked with a distinct graphic identifier. Risk analysis publications
bear a triangular symbol formed by an arrow drawing a triangle, with a dot at the centre.
Metaphorically, the arrow represents the cyclical nature of risk analysis processes and their
orientation towards an appropriate operational response. The triangle is a symbol of ideal
proportions and knowledge, reflecting the pursuit of factual exactness, truth and exhaustive
analysis. The dot at the centre represents the intelligence factor and the focal point where
information from diverse sources converges to be processed, systematised and shared as
analytical products. Thus, Frontex’s risk analysis is meant to be at the centre and to form
a reliable basis for its operational activities.

Executive summary
In the third quarter of 2013 there was a massive influx of irregular migration in the Central
Mediterranean. This, combined with sustained detections in the Ionian and Eastern
Aegean Seas, meant that there were more
detections of illegal border-crossing at the
maritime borders of the EU than during any
stage of the Arab Spring in 2011. Concurrent
with this influx, there were more applications
for international protection in the EU than in
any other period since data collection began
for this indicator in 2008.
In Q3 2013, Syrians were the most detected
nationality at the EU level in terms of several
different indicators of irregular migration,
such as detections of illegal border-crossing
(across several locations and border types),
clandestine entries, illegal stay in several
Member States, and document fraud at both
the external border and on intra-Schengen
flights. Syrians also submitted more applications for asylum than any other nationality. Hence, without doubt Syrians were the
most common nationality reported for the
FRAN indicators of irregular migration in Q3
2013 and there are few signs of this changing to any significant degree in the short or
medium term.
Over the last few years there have been some
extraordinary trends in the number of asylum
applications submitted in the EU, in terms of:
(a) the total volume of applications submitted; (b) the increasing concentration of applications submitted by the top nationalities;
and (c) the increasing proportion of applications received by the top Member States. In
2011 there was an increase associated with
the initial stages of the Arab Spring, as well
as large numbers of applications submitted
by nationals of the Western Balkan countries.

Over the last one and a half years there has
also been a dramatic increase in the number
of applications submitted by Syrians, and in
Q2 2013 there were more applications submitted by a single nationality than ever before, i.e. Russian nationals of Chechen origin
submitting applications in both Poland and
Germany. Resulting from these effects, some
of which are still detectable in the FRAN data,
in Q3 2013 there were more asylum applications submitted in the EU than ever before, with an increasing concentration in the
top three Member States: Germany, Sweden
and the UK.
In Q3 2013, 42 618 detections of illegal border-crossing were reported at the EU level,
which is very nearly double the number during the same period in 2012, and a fourfold
increase compared to the beginning of the
year. This dramatic rise was almost exclusively due to increased detections reported
from the Italian blue border, specifically in
Sicily and Lampedusa. The most commonly
detected migrants were from Syria and Eritrea and, to a lesser extent, from Somalia
and Egypt. In most cases, migrants arrived in
boats from Libya but Egyptians departed from
their own country. Across the region the use
of large iron mother-ships, with smaller vessels for boarding and disembarking on tow,
became more common. There were also increased detections of Syrians and Eritreans
in Apulia and Calabria, and as a result, these
nationalities ranked top at the EU level and
detections of Eritreans increased more than
any other nationality compared to a year
previously.
Tragically, there were several major incidents
of boats capsizing in the Central Mediterranean resulting in massive loss of life, including

women and children. Intelligence gathered
during interviews suggests that migrants
subject to frequent racial attacks are gathering in increasing numbers in Libya, and that
the political stability and internal security in
Egypt are both worsening. Hence, the migration pressure in the Central Mediterranean region is likely to remain at a high level.
After Sicily and Lampedusa, the next border section to be most affected by illegal
border-crossings during the third quarter
of 2013 was the Hungarian land border with
Serbia, where detections have fluctuated
dramatically throughout 2013 in response to
a series of legislative changes aligning the
treatment and detention of asylum seekers
to EU ­standards; detections at this border
section nearly doubled in relation to a year
ago but were reduced by 50% compared to
the previous quarter.
In Greece, where detections have tended to
be concentrated in recent years, the overall
number of detections of illegal border-crossing remained stable between the second and
third quarters of 2013 but was still sufficiently
high for Greece to be rank second among all
Member States for this indicator. This is because Greece continues to be affected by
two independent flows of irregular migration: at its borders with Turkey and Albania.
Until the launch of the Greek operation Aspida in August 2012, the Greek land border
with Turkey had for many years been the main
entry point to illegally cross the border into
the EU. Since then detections have dropped
to negligible levels but have risen elsewhere,
particularly at the Eastern Aegean Sea and
on the Bulgarian land border with Turkey,

6 of 58

now ranking fourth and fifth among all border sections. In these locations detections increased going into the third quarter of this
year, mostly of Syrians and, to a lesser extent,
Afghans. In Bulgaria the 600% increase in detections of illegal border-crossing compared
to a year previously was the largest increase
at the EU level and was accompanied by an
increase in asylum applications.
At the Greek land border with Albania, detections of illegal border-crossing remained
stable compared to the previous year, almost exclusively involving Albanian circular migrants. Detections of Albanians using
fraudulent documents to gain entry to Greece
decreased in Q3 2013, but the number of Albanian refused entry and detected as illegal stayers increased to the highest level
in Greece for several years. Given that Albanians were also widely detected in other
Member States, particularly using fraudulent
documents to enter the UK from the Schengen area, and as illegal stayers and subject
to decisions to leave in France, the pressure
of irregular migration from this nationality
remains high.
Document fraud increased in the third quarter of 2013 both in terms of detections at the
external border and also of migrants making secondary movements within the Schengen area, or attempting entry to the UK from
the Schengen area. Spain, Italy, France and
Greece reported the most detections on entry
at the external border together accounting
for more than half of all detections at the EU
level. For the second quarter in a row Spain
has reported more detections than ever before, the most common of which were Moroccans detected in either Melilla or Ceuta.

1. Introduction
FRAN Quarterly reports are prepared by the
Frontex Risk Analysis Unit and provide a regular overview of irregular migration at the
EU external borders, based on the irregularmigration data exchanged among Member
State border-control authorities within the
cooperative framework of the Frontex Risk
Analysis Network (FRAN) and its subsidiary,
the European Union Document-Fraud Risk
Analysis Network (EDF-RAN).
The main purpose of the FRAN Quarterlies
is to provide:
1.	feedback to the FRAN community in the
context of information exchange;
2.	a periodic update to the situational picture of irregular migration at the EU level;
and
3.	material for constructive discussion on reporting protocols and related trends and
patterns.
This report is intended to simultaneously
serve two objectives: first, to provide a clear
summary of the situation at the external border of the EU, and second, to serve as an archive for future reference and comparative
analyses. Consistent with standard archival
techniques, some information is repeated
among sections to serve as context.

Harmonising complex, multi-source migration data among Frontex and Member States
is an ongoing process. Therefore some of
the more detailed data and trends in this
report should be interpreted with caution
and, where possible, cross-referenced with
information from other sources. The statistics should be understood in the context of
the different levels of passenger flows passing
through different border sections, the activities undertaken by Member State bordercontrol authorities to secure different border
sections, and widespread variation in reporting and data-collection practices.
FRAN members and Member State risk analysis experts and border-control authorities
are considered the primary customers of
these reports. In addition to the discussions
taking place during FRAN meetings, Member State experts are invited and actively
encouraged to examine and comment upon
the data and analyses presented here. Despite all efforts of the Frontex Risk Analysis
Unit and Member State experts involved in
data exchange and analyses, it is conceivable that minor errors will occur in these reports due to very challenging timelines, and
the growing volume and complexity of data
and other information exchanged within the
FRAN community.

2. Methodology
This, the 21st issue of the FRAN Quarterly, is a
comparative analysis of FRAN data collected
between July and September 2013, and exchanged between 30 Member State bordercontrol authorities within the framework of
the FRAN. The report presents the results of
statistical analysis of quarterly variations in
eight irregular-migration indicators and one
asylum indicator, aggregated at the level of
the event. Bi-monthly analytical reports exchanged by Member States were also used
for interpretative purposes and to provide
qualitative information, as were other available sources of information, such as Frontex
Joint Operations.

terest group of the European Commission’s
CIRCA server. Member State monthly data are
based on a country template prepared by the
Frontex Risk Analysis Unit. The deadline for
submitting data for each month is the 25th
day of the subsequent month, with the exception of the end of year data, which are requested by 15 January each year. For this 21st
issue of the FRAN Quarterly, the target for
Member States to upload the monthly data
was thus 25 October 2013. In principle, data
submitted subsequent to this date will be reflected in the next FRAN Quarterly, except
in cases where clarification is needed in order to proceed with comprehensive analysis.

Precise definitions of Indicators 1 to 6, aimed
at harmonising the data exchanged at EU
level, were presented in the annexes of the
Q1 and Q2 reports in 2009 and so are not
repeated here.

Following the closure of the CIREFI working
group in April 2010, most of its mandates and,
of particular relevance, the exchange of data
were transferred to the FRAN. Fortunately,
most CIREFI indicators already overlapped
with the monthly data exchange of FRAN
members. The exception was the indicator
on returns, which was added as part of the
regular data exchange within the FRAN at
the beginning of 2011.

During the June 2010 FRAN Meeting, a proposal for a harmonised definition of the return
indicator was outlined and several questions
were presented in order to motivate discussion among FRAN members in view of establishing the regular collection of monthly
return data by Frontex. Subsequently, an online survey of FRAN members was conducted
to gather information and further motivate
discussion to fine-tune the proposal for the
indicator. The 11th FRAN report (Q1 2011) was
the first to include analysis of Indicators 7A
and 7B, and the definitions of these indicators are included in an annex to that report.
Data collection commenced in January 2011.

The FRAN data-exchange has been in place
since September 2007. Data are exchanged
through the ICONet Internet platform, an in-

In January 2012, the European Union Document-Fraud Risk Analysis Network (EDFRAN) was formed as a specialist forum to
oversee the exchange and analyses of detections of document fraud to illegally cross
the external borders, and on all international
flights.
The EDF-RAN data are checked for inconsistencies, and corrections are made to reported
totals to bring them in line with reported
breakdowns. Corrections are also made to
any three-letter nationality codes not present

External borders refer to the borders between
Member States and third countries. The borders between the Schengen Associated Countries (Norway, Iceland and Switzerland) and
third countries are also considered as external
borders. The borders between the Schengen
Associated Countries and Schengen Member
States are considered as internal borders. For
the indicators on detections of facilitators, illegal stay and asylum, statistics are also reported for detections at the land borders
between the Schengen Member States and
Schengen candidates (Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania) or non-Schengen Member States (the
UK, Ireland), so that a total for EU Member
States and Schengen Associated Countries as
a whole can be presented. It was not possible to make this distinction for air and sea
borders because Member States do not habitually differentiate between extra-EU and
intra-EU air and sea connections but tend to
aggregate data for all arrivals.

When data are examined at the level of thirdcountry nationalities, a large percentage
usually falls under the category ‘Other (not
specified)’ or ‘Unknown’. It is expected that
the percentage reported under these categories will decrease with time as Member States improve the quality and speed
of their identification, data collection and
reporting practices; nationalities are often
reported as ‘Unknown’ if an individual’s nationality cannot be established before reports are submitted.

Joint Operations active for at least a proportion of Q3 2013. Namely, for sea borders they

Both primary data sources, such as interviews
with irregular migrants, and secondary data
sources, such as reports of intelligence analysts, daily reports of deployed officers and
analytical products (weekly and bi-weekly
analytical reports for each abovementioned
operation), were used to provide an exhaustive overview of the situation at the external
borders of the EU. Additionally, open-source
data were researched as background information for the present analysis.

The Frontex Risk Analysis Unit would like
to express its gratitude to all FRAN and
EDF-RAN members and their associates in
Member State statistical, migration and document-fraud units who collect, aggregate
and exchange monthly data, and to the analysts who compile the bi-monthly analytical reports, on which much of the detailed
analyses presented here are based.
We are also grateful to Member State representatives who responded to requests for
additional information on key topics and
emerging trends.

detections reported from the Italian blue
border, specifically in the Central Mediterranean region. These detections were mostly of
Syrians and Eritreans and, to a lesser extent,
Egyptians and Somalis, arriving in boats to the
Pelagic Islands (mainly Lampedusa) and Sicily. Tragically, in Q3 2013 there were several
major incidents of boats capsizing in the region resulting in a massive loss of life including women and children. These events were
widely reported in the media, and attracted a
lot of political attention to the issue of irregular migration in the Mediterranean in general, including several statements released
from EU Commissioner for Home Affairs Cecilia Malmström, and her visit to Lampedusa
with Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta* (see
Section 4.2.2. Central Mediterranean route).

Since the beginning of 2013 there has been
a massive increase in detections of illegal
border-crossing to a level even greater than
that during the Arab Spring in 2011. Overall,
there were 42 618 detections of illegal bordercrossing at the EU level, which is the highest
number during any single quarter since 2008,
very nearly double the number reported during the same quarter in 2012, and more than
four times higher than at the beginning of
the year. Most detections of illegal bordercrossing were at the sea border of the EU,
where irregular migration has not been at
similarly high levels for five years. This level
of illegal-border crossing represents a massive influx of irregular migration at the external border of the EU.

Elsewhere, in Greece detections remained
stable between the second and third quarters of 2013 but remained at a sufficiently
high level for Greece to rank second among
all Member States in terms of illegal border-

Similarly to the situation during the initial
stages of the Arab Spring in 2011, this strong
surge was almost exclusively due to increased

crossings. The Greek land border with Turkey
was for many years considered to be the main
entry point for illegal border-crossing, until
the launch of the Greek operation Aspida in
August 2012. As a consequence of the operation Aspida, in nearby Bulgaria detections
of illegal border-crossing have been steadily
increasing. For example, between the second and third quarters of 2013 detections increased threefold mostly due to more Syrians
and, to a lesser extent, Afghans and Algerians,
detected at the Bulgarian land border with
Turkey. This rise was associated with an increase in asylum applications in Bulgaria (see
Section 4.2.4. Eastern Mediterranean route).
In Hungary detections of illegal border-crossing were more than three times higher than
a year ago but down by a half compared to
the previous quarter. This remarkable fluctuation in such a short space of time was due
to a series of legislative changes affecting the
treatment and detention of asylum seekers,
which resulted in a brief but very significant
and still apparent pull factor to the Hungarian land border with Serbia (see Section 4.2.1.
Western Balkan route).
