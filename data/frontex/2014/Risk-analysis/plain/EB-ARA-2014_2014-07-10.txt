Frontex official publications fall into four main categories: risk analysis, training, operations
and research, each marked with a distinct graphic identifier. Risk analysis publications bear a
triangular symbol formed by an arrow drawing a triangle, with a dot at the centre. Metaphorically, the arrow represents the cyclical nature of risk analysis processes and its orientation
towards an appropriate operational response. The triangle is a symbol of ideal proportions
and knowledge, reflecting the pursuit of factual exactness, truth and exhaustive analysis.
The dot at the centre represents the intelligence factor and the focal point where information from diverse sources converges to be processed, systematised and shared as analytical
products. Thus, Frontex risk analysis is meant to be at the centre and to form a reliable basis for its operational activities.

Executive summary
In 2013, border security at the borders between Member States and Belarus, Moldova, Ukraine and the Russian Federation
was shaped by several interlinked factors.
Firstly, overall regular passenger flow continued to grow in 2013, by roughly 10% from 2012.
The growth was driven by expanding legal
travel channels – growing visa issuance and
implementation of local border traffic agreements – as well as longer-term economic developments in Eastern European Borders Risk
Analysis Network (EB-RAN) countries and the
Russian Federation encouraging mobility of
people and goods. Growing regular traffic has
generated considerable pressure on bordercrossing points’ (BCPs) capacity to keep the
traffic both smooth and secure. In addition to
development of infrastructure, Border Guard
authorities are searching for new innovative
solutions for border checks technology, logistics and processes. Although the growth of
traffic can be expected to be modest in 2014,
these efforts should be further encouraged,
as long-term factors for the growth in traffic remain valid.
Secondly and somewhat connected to regular
passenger flows, the smuggling of excise and
illicit goods remained a major threat to border
security. Data collected within the EB-RAN,
as well as during Frontex-coordinated Joint
Operations, indicate that the smuggling of
tobacco products was particularly common.
Smuggling occurred primarily through official BCPs; however, a variety of modi operandi
were also detected at green borders (between
BCPs) varying from the so-called ‘ant smuggling’ through the BCPs to the use of rafts at
the border rivers to smuggle large amounts
of cigarettes across common borders.* Additionally, cross-border criminal activities also

included attempts to smuggle stolen vehicles and motorbikes from the EU to EB-RAN
countries. Smuggling of illicit drugs range from
cannabis and synthetic drugs transiting  /  originating in the EU and smuggled towards EBRAN countries to heroin and precursors of
amphetamines smuggled to the EU.
Thirdly, there were more irregular movements
of people across the common borders in 2013.
However, the trends as regards modi operandi and origin of irregular migrants were
quite varied.
In 2013 detections of illegal border-crossing remained low (1 316) in comparison with
other sections of the EU’s external borders:
only 1.2% of all illegal border-crossings reported by Member States at the external
borders were reported from the 6 000-kilometre-long eastern borders of the EU. Arguably this is because migrants taking the route
via EB-RAN countries or the Russian Federation to the EU, especially non-regional migrants, face (a) logistic difficulties and high
costs; (b) efficiently cooperating border-control authorities on both sides of the common borders; and therefore (c) high risk of
detection. Although ‘push factors’ in origin
countries of irregular migrants, such as Afghanistan, would point to a growing threat of
illegal border-crossing, the magnitude of the
threat will most likely be limited in a wider
EU perspective.
In contrast to the rather low level of threat
as regards illegal border-crossing, the issue
of migrants refused entry and then applying
for asylum and absconding from reception
centres can be assessed as the most serious
at common borders in 2013 in terms of magnitude. The number of refusals of entry rose

of the EB-RAN region in
Figure 3, page 12.

Frontex · Eastern European Borders Annual Risk Analysis 2014

to over 50 000, i.e. 39% of the EU total, indicating a growing risk of abuse of legal travel
channels. While the large number of refusals
of entry can be partly explained by growth
in regular traffic, two individual phenomena
stood out in 2013:
1.	A sharp increase in nationals of the Russian Federation of Chechen origin refused
entry and then using asylum applications
in Poland as a way to enter the EU and
move further on to Germany.
2.	The continued flow of Georgian nationals
to Poland and further on to other Member
States using a variety of modus operandi.
The main entry point in both cases was the
Polish-Belarusian border.
While not attracting media attention and not
putting the lives of migrants at risk, the use
of this modus operandi appears to be a significant entry channel of irregular migration to
the EU. It exploits possibilities for legal entry
while still absorbing an important part of the
resources at the border.
The abuse of visas in order to work irregularly
and  /  or overstay in other Member States than
that stated in the visa was also reported, including continued use of fraudulent supporting documentation and falsified stamps to
conceal the fact of overstaying.

6 of 50

As the abuse of visas, asylum system and
other means of legal entry touches responsibilities of many authorities, the risks should
be mitigated by searching for solutions from
all four tiers of border security: measures implemented by third countries, cooperation
agreements, border checks and measures
within the area of free movement.
The situation in Ukraine is the main uncertainty considering the outlook on border security. So far, at the common borders with
the EU, the impact of the crisis has remained
limited. However, continued political and economic pressure in Ukraine does make stabilisation of the situation hard to achieve.
Population movements from the contested
areas, especially Crimea and Eastern Ukraine
are possible. On the other hand, economic and
political instability may cause changes in labour migration, thus possibly also impacting
irregular movements.
Despite the existing risks in border security,
there are also important positive developments in sight: the implementation of the
EU-Moldova visa liberalisation in April 2014
can be regarded as a major sign of enhanced
border security and cooperation in the region,
which makes it possible to promote regular
cross-border mobility without compromising border security.

1.Introduction and methodology
The European Agency for the Management
of Operational Cooperation at the External
Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex) created a concept of
the Eastern Borders Conference (EBC) in August 2008. The EBC was designed as a regular activity  /  forum where specific challenges
related to irregular migration at the eastern borders of the EU could be addressed by
FRAN (Frontex Risk Analysis Network) representatives and the relevant neighbouring
third countries.
By 2009 Frontex had signed working arrangements with Ukraine, the Russian Federation,
Moldova and Belarus. Subsequently, Frontex proposed to set up a permanent Eastern European Borders Risk Analysis Network
(EB-RAN), to be comprised of the competent
border-control authorities from the mentioned four countries and the Risk Analysis
Unit of Frontex. Additional arrangements
were later signed allowing for the establishment of regular information exchange and
joint analytical activities: with Moldova in
March 2009 (Cooperation Plan), with Ukraine
in November 2010 (Mechanism on information exchange for risk analysis cooperation)
and with Belarus in November 2010 (Memorandum on regular exchange information
and joint analytical activities). Importantly,
the Russian Federation opted to stay out of
the EB-RAN.*

1.1. Data collection and
additional information
In order to facilitate the exchange of information between the EB-RAN countries and
Frontex, the Commission and Frontex set up
a secure Internet platform on the European
Commission’s CIRCABC server, similarly to

what is available for the FRAN. This platform
is used exclusively by EB-RAN countries and
the Frontex Risk Analysis Unit.
EB-RAN statistical data from Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine are available for the period 2010–2013. The core of the overview are
the EB-RAN and monthly statistical data of
neighbouring FRAN members: Norway, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania (only common
borders, or borders with the Russian Federation) covering the year 2013. There are five
key indicators of irregular migration: (1) detections of illegal border-crossing, (2) detections of facilitators, (3) detections of illegal
stay, (4) refusals of entry; and (5) asylum applications. The last indicator used in previous reports (detections of false documents)
is now covered by the EDF-RAN (European
Union Document-Fraud Risk Analysis Network) with its statistical templates.
The 2014 Annual Risk Analysis will follow
the notion of risk as defined by the updated
Common Integrated Risk Analysis Model, introduced in 2011.
EB-RAN countries – Belarus, Moldova and
Ukraine – were addressed, prior to the expert meeting of 1 April 2014, with a Request
for Information (RFI) covering the defined
main risks in accordance to CIRAM methodology. Answers were received from all EB-RAN
countries.
Other sources include, in particular, bimonthly
analytical reports from Member States, FRAN
Quarterlies, Tailored Risk Analyses produced
in 2013 and Frontex reporting from different Joint Operations coordinated by Frontex.

* Even though the
Russian Federation has

the Eastern European

Network and does not

this report continues

States with the Russian

States and Schengen
Associated countries.

Open sources of information such as reports
issued by government agencies, EU institutions and international or non-governmental organisations were also used.

1.2. Quality of available data
Consistent with other law-enforcement indicators, variation in administrative data related to border control depends on several
factors. In this case, the number of detections of illegal border-crossing and refusals
of entry are both functions of the amount
of effort spent detecting migrants and the
flow of irregular migrants. For example, increased detections of illegal border-crossing
might be due to an actual increase in the flow
of irregular migrants, or they may in fact be
an outcome of more resources made available to detect migrants. In exceptional cases,
an influx of resources may produce an increase in reported detections while effectively masking the actual decrease in the
flow of migrants, resulting from a strong
deterrent effect.
Similar issues should be taken into account
regarding the number of detections of crossborder crime at the borders. Higher numbers of detections at a particular BCP might
indicate a surge in criminality, but may also
be the result of more efficient border control and / or the presence of specialists whose
expertise in a certain area (the identification of stolen vehicles, for instance) may
increase the number of detections. The statistical data used for this analysis should
not be considered as official statistics but
as management of information to support
the planning of joint operational activities.
The data might therefore occasionally vary
from data published officially by national authorities. The use of slightly adapted FRAN
monthly statistical templates by EB-RAN
countries created some compatibility issues between the FRAN and EB-RAN data
sets. In particular, reasons for refusals of en-

8 of 50

try (Indicator 4) are standardised for FRAN
members, but vary among EB-RAN members in line with their national legislations.
Detections of illegal border-crossing at BCPs
(Indicator 1B), as reported by EB-RAN countries, should also be analysed with caution
since they may also include figures for persons using forged documents (Indicator 6).
It should also be taken into consideration
that figures for illegal stay (Indicator 3) refer only to detections at the border on exit
of persons overstaying in a particular country. Considering some of the neighbouring
Member States, the indicator on asylum
applications does not have a clear link with
common borders (especially Hungary, Finland and Norway) as most asylum seekers
arrive in these countries using other routes.
Considering reporting on detections of illegal border-crossing between BCPs, it should
be noted that the growth of detections in
Estonian data in 2013 is for the most part
due to changes in reporting and not in the
actual detections.

1.3. Application of the Common
Integrated Risk Analysis
Model (CIRAM)
A key development in the CIRAM update released in 2011 is the adoption of a management approach to risk analysis that defines
risk as a function of threat, vulnerability and
impact. Such an approach endeavours to
emphasise risk analysis as a key tool in ensuring the optimal allocation of resources
within constraints of budget, staff and the
efficiency of equipment. According to the
model, a ‘threat’ is a force or pressure acting upon the external borders that is characterised by both its magnitude and likelihood;
‘vulnerability’ is defined as the capacity of a
system to mitigate the threat; and ‘impact’
is determined as the potential consequences
of the threat. In this way, the structured and
systematic breakdown of risk is presented in
the risk assessment and conclusions chapters.

2.1. Border controls
Regular passenger flows
The total number of border-crossings (both
entry and exit) in regular cross-border traffic
at the common borders including the border
with the Russian Federation reached approximately 77 million in 2013, roughly a 10%
increase from 2012.* Belarus, Moldova and
Ukraine reported additional 54 million border-crossings at their borders with regional
neighbours.
Depending on the border section, the main
reasons for growth include the following
factors: (a) increased visa issuance by Member States; (b) implementation of local border traffic agreements (LBTA); and (c) overall
growth of shopping-related cross-border
travel by both EU and EB-RAN country and
Russian nationals.
The Polish-Ukrainian border section remained the busiest in terms of border-crossings with roughly 16.7 million
border-crossings (+11% compared to 2012)
followed by Finland-Russian Federation
with 12.9 million border-crossings (+8%).
The sharpest growth of traffic was reported
at Poland’s border with the Russian Federation’s Kaliningrad region, with a 52% growth
from roughly 4 to 6 million border-crossings.
The growth at this border section may be
explained by increased visa issuance and
especially the implementation of the local
border traffic agreement in July 2012. The
number of border-crossings (entry and exit)
by citizens of the Russian Federation with
local border traffic (LBT) permits increased
from 27 000 in 2012 to 1.15 million in 2013.
As reported by Polish border authorities
the level of traffic is very high especially at
weekends, pointing to shopping- and tourism-related travel.

At the regional borders the busiest border
section was the Ukrainian-Russian border
with 28.2 million border-crossings.
Both common and regional borders have
some distinctive seasonal trends resulting
from labour migration and tourism. Peaks
during the holiday seasons and at weekends
create considerable pressure on the capacity
of the BCPs, which requires an optimal use
of resources in order to avoid undue waiting
times for bona fide travellers.
Composition of regular passenger flows
From the EU Member State point of view citizens enjoying free movement are subject to
minimum checks, while third-country nationals, whether they require visas or not,
are subject to more thorough checks, as defined by the Schengen Borders Code. Hence
the composition and extent of passenger flow
determine, to a large extent, the allocation
of resources for border checks.

* Data on regular traffic
were collected for the
second year in a row.
However, due to some
changes in sources as
well as some problems in
the traffic-data collection
systems amongst
Member States, data
sets of 2012 and 2013
are not fully comparable
for all border sections.
Therefore, a precise
comparison of total
regular traffic figures is
not possible. However,
the data clearly show an
overall growing trend of
regular traffic.

Data on composition of the regular traffic was
not available from all border sections, but generally the share of non-EU citizens remained
clearly higher than that of EU-citizens, ranging from almost 90% at the Polish-Belarusian
border to roughly 60% at the Latvian-Russian border. Even at the Slovakian-Ukrainian
border – which was the only border section
recording a decrease in the number of border-crossings – the number of non-EU citizens grew both in absolute and relative terms.
From the point of view of EU Member State
border authorities this means that a large majority of travellers go through the more thorough checks. Thus the growth in the traffic
of non-EU nationals increases not only the
number of checks but also the average time
of performing the check.

Outlook on regular passenger traffic
Most of the long-term factors, such as the
development of transport connections and
increased issuance of passports and visas,
point to a continuing growth of regular passenger traffic. However, in the shorter term
it is possible that this trend may stagnate or,
at some border sections, even turn to a decrease in 2014. The reason is the slowdown

14 of 50

of economic growth in the Russian Federation and Ukraine – and the weakening of their
currencies in relation to the euro – which is
likely to limit the growth potential of regular
traffic in the coming year in terms of tourism, shopping trips and lorry traffic. Much
also depends on the Ukrainian crisis and its
impact on the economy. However, based on
the experiences from 2009, the effect of an
economic drop on the foreign travel was less

dramatic in the case of cheaper travel options to the nearby regions than in the case
of more expensive longer-distance travel.
In contrast to general developments, the EUMoldova visa liberalisation implemented in
April 2014 is likely to have a positive impact
on the growth of regular traffic at the Moldovan-Romanian border, though Moldova
assesses the impact as relatively low.
Visas
EU-level data on visa issuance for 2013 are
not yet available, but according to the data
for 2012 the issuance of visas by Member
States* in EB-RAN countries and the Russian Federation continued to grow in 2012.
In fact visas issued in the Russian Federation
alone accounted for 42% of all visas issued in
2012, with nearly 6 million visas representing a 15% increase compared to the previous
year. Visas issued in Ukraine followed, with
1 283 014 visas issued in 2012, which was a
10% increase compared to 2011.
In 2012 Finland issued by far the largest number of visas (1 313 864) in the Russian Federation, with an 11% increase compared to 2011,
followed by Spain (920 490, increase by 23%),
Greece (655 887) and Italy (631 120). Poland
was the biggest issuer of visas in Ukraine
(447 813, an increase of 21% compared to 2011).
According to Finnish data, the growth of visa
issuance continued in 2013, with roughly 1.5
million visas issued in the Russian Federation.
Although the figures from 2012 only partly
influenced the situation in 2013 (in terms of
longer one- or two-year visas) and not all
traffic conducted by these visas shows up at
common borders, the trend of visa issuance
is an important indicator of possible traffic
growth and possible use of legal travel channels. On the other hand, it also gives context
against which the trends in illegal border-

crossings, refusals of entry and illegal stay
can be better analysed.
The average refusal rate for all visa applications in 2012 was 4.8%. Considering visas
issued in Ukraine, Belarus and the Russian
Federation the refusal rates were considerably lower, pointing to an overall lower
per capita risk of irregular migration. Refusal rate for visas issued in 2012 was 2% in
Ukraine, 0.9% in the Russian Federation and
0.5% in Belarus. In relative terms, the highest
rate of refused visas among EB-RAN countries was registered in Moldova (with refusals
ratio of 6.6%); however, a sharply decreasing trend was observed from 11.4% in 2010
to 4.8% in 2013.

Number of passports issued in
the Russian Federation grows
sharply
The number of passport** holders in the Russian Federation has
risen sharply in recent years raising the potential for regular crossborder traffic. While in 2008 it was
estimated that the share of citizens of the Russian Federation was
only 5% the current estimate is 17%
or roughly 23-25 million. While the
passport holders have tended to
concentrate in the large cities, such
as Moscow and St Petersburg, the
number of issued passports in the
provinces has grown recently too.
During the first three months of
2013 there were already 2.7 million passport issued, which was
22.5% more than during the
corresponding period of the
last year.

* At the time of writing
of this report data on
EU visa issuance for 2013
were not yet available.
Visa data are collected
on the basis of the
place of making the
application and not on
the nationality of the
visa applicant. Thus, for
instance, applications
made in the Russian
Federation do not
necessarily concern
only Russian nationals.
However, the data can be
used as the most suitable
approximation of the
number of visas issued to
citizens of that country.
** In the Russian
Federation there are
two types of passports:
the domestic and the
international. The
domestic is compulsory
for all citizens over 14
years of age and it is also
valid for travel to most
CIS countries. However,
the international
passport is required for
all other cross-border
travel.

For example, after finishing the reconstruction of Privalka BCP – which increased its
capacity threefold – Belarus continues reconstruction of several BCPs. Belarus is also
interested in changing the status of some
BCPs from local to international. In order to
lift the pressure from the existing BCPs, new
BCPs are also being built, such as BudomierzHrushev between Poland and Ukraine, which
was opened in December 2013.
However, in the current economic situation
there are limits to investments in the new
BCPs. Therefore, a new approach and innovative solutions to increase the efficiency of
the currently available resources are necessary. The following not all-encompassing list
of mitigation measures is intended to give a
quick look at the measures that have been
planned or implemented at various border
sections in the region.
a) New logistical and technical solutions
for border checks

© Polish Border Guard

Effectiveness and speed of border checks can
be enhanced by minimising the time required
for passengers to move from the vehicles to
the checks. One possible solution is the implementation of checks at particular lanes,
as planned at large BCPs in southeast Finland. The general principle is that first-line
border checks are made while the passengers are staying in their vehicles. The first
experiences from the Finnish BCP of Imatra
have been good.

Possible measures to mitigate growing
pressure in border checks

Poland, on the other hand, has constructed
special lanes for LBT permit holders at the BCP
of Grzechotki in order to speed up checks.

Growth of regular traffic in recent years has
required increased resources from the border authorities to maintain security and facilitate travel. Consistent efforts to develop
BCP infrastructure are needed to keep up
with the growing traffic flows.

Train border checks have also been developed either with mobile checks performed
on trains (for example Helsinki / St Petersburg) or at departure stations (for example
Vilnius /Minsk) thus minimising long stops at
BCPs and allowing more time for the checks.

© Finnish Border Guard

Figure 7. Plan of infrastructure for lane checks (now under construction)

Automated Border Control (ABC) can also
help decrease pressure on BCP personnel.
Looking from the EU-side of the border, the
main problem has been the technical difficulty in using the ABC by third-country
nationals.
b) Online queuing  /  registration systems
for border checks
In order to avoid the formation of queues and
to make border-crossing smoother for bona
fide travellers, several Member States (Lithuania, Estonia and Finland) have adopted
or are planning to introduce online systems
for lorry and / or passenger traffic where a
time slot for border checks can be ordered
in advance. According to open sources, similar systems are planned also by the Russian
Federal Agency for the Development of the
State Border Facilities (Rosgranitsa) at the
Finnish-Russian border.
In addition to providing comfort to travellers, these systems make the operational
environment more predictable for the border authorities and help in planning the use
of resources.
Another possible added value in these systems could be the exploitation of Advance
Passenger Information (API). However, in the
current systems, the data required to reserve
the slot are limited, for example, to the name
of the client and registration number of the
vehicle. However, the possibilities to use the
information available in the queuing systems
should be fully explored.

c) Strengthening of the co-operation
between border authorities,
especially customs
Close cooperation between border and Customs authorities is one of the key issues in
improving the capacity to counter cross-border crime. Additionally, cooperation makes
the use of resources more efficient.
In Finland, border guards and customs officials
have continued the Nuija project, where the
cargo and passenger traffic have been segregated. In the first phase of the project the
Customs carried out first-line border checks
in cargo traffic on behalf of the Border Guard.
Cooperation also took place in the form of joint
briefings at the beginning of each shift, joint
field checks (including drug detection dogs) on
lanes and further training for both authorities.
The use of shared databases and information
systems by the Border Guard, Customs and
Traffic Police also increased the speed of border
control. The NUIJA2 pilot, which ran from December 2012 to October 2013, further expanded
cooperation. The Border Guard conducted certain duties on behalf of the Customs, for example checking vehicle insurances, tax-free sales
export validation i.e. checking and stamping
tax-free cheques and invoices. The project has
resulted in more flexible and efficient use of
resources and an altogether smoother process
for customers (one-stop shop).
d) Legal changes considering private
imports of excise goods
Small-scale smuggling of excise goods, especially petrol, for resale purposes has been

17 of 50

Frontex · Eastern European Borders Annual Risk Analysis 2014

widespread at several border sections. In
some locations these activities produced significant queues at BCPs. Consequently, the
restrictions of these activities can have important impacts on the volume of passenger
flows. For example, when Estonia restricted
the number of imports of fuel without excise
duty in December 2013 to only one per month
the traffic flow decreased by 20% arguably
streamlining the border checks of other regular passenger flows.

of drugs also remained an important threat
to border security at several border sections.
Cross-border crime was also behind a large
number of detected illegal border-crossings,
especially those involving migrants of regional nationalities.

The smoothness of border checks is, indeed,
a factor in the development of tourism. For
example, it has been assessed that the reasons for the recent growth in Russian tourism
in Estonia included improved transportation
links and shorter queues for border checks.

Detections of illegal border-crossing between
BCPs dropped slightly by 11% from 5 299 to
4 708 at common and regional borders (including the border with the Russian Federation with data from the EU or EB-RAN
member side of the border only). Similarly,
detections of illegal border-crossing at BCPs
dropped by 15% from 2 236 to 1 908.

e) Future possibilities: entry  /  exitsystems and Registered Passenger
Programs
An EU-level Entry / Exit System to record the
time and place of entry and exit of third-country nationals would make checks of period of
stay faster and at the same time mitigate
the risk of the use of false stamps. Registered Traveller Programmes (RTPs) would
allow certain groups of frequent travellers
from third countries to enter using simplified
border checks, again speeding up the checks.
From the EU-point of view these mitigation
measures are included into the Smart Borders
package that should be fully implemented.

2.2. Irregular migration
The trends in irregular migration at the common borders were mixed with fewer detected
attempts of illegal border-crossing but clearly
more refusals of entry, indicating rising the
risk of abuse of legal travel channels. Crossborder criminality, mainly of large- and smallscale smuggling of excise goods (tobacco),
trafficking in stolen vehicles, and smuggling

18 of 50

Illegal border-crossing
Detections at common and regional
borders

However, it should be strongly stressed that
only 33% of the detected illegal border-crossings between BCPs and merely 9.4% of those
at BCPs were associated with the purpose of
irregular migration, while the share of smuggling purposes was 12% and 19%, respectively.
‘Other’ reasons, which accounted for 40% of
the detections and were reported especially
from the regional borders, were often connected with illegal hunting, fishing and other
local-level activities with little or no impact
on the wider EB-RAN region.
Detections by Member States  /Schengen
Associated Countries
In 2013 detections of illegal border-crossing by
the Member States remained at a low level in
comparison with other parts of the EU borders: only 1.2% of all illegal border-crossings
reported by Member States at external borders were reported from the 6 000-kilometre-long EU’s eastern borders.
In line with figures from common and regional borders, Member States also reported

decreasing (-18%) detections of illegal bordercrossing between BCPs in 2013 (1 316) compared with the previous year (1 597). However,
the figures were still clearly higher than in
2011 (1 049). The drop in relation to 2012 can
be explained by two main factors: the drop
in detections of Somali nationals at the Slovakian-Ukrainian border and the overall increase in detections of illegal border-crossing
by the Belarusian authorities at the Lithuanian-Belarusian border.
The decrease of detections at the so-called
eastern border route contrasted with the rising trend of detections of illegal border-crossing at the EU external border in general (+48%
in comparison with 2012). Although the same
external factors, such as the Syrian war, do
have impact on practically all European borders, the magnitude of that impact in terms
of irregular migration flows remained low at
common land borders. The decrease of transiting non-regional migrants, especially Somalis and Afghans, at the eastern border route
could be partly explained by the difficulty and
cost of taking the eastern border route when
compared with other cheaper and more reliable alternative routes towards the EU in 2013.
The number of detected attempts of clandestine entry at the BCPs at common borders
by Member States was only six (all reported
by Romania). However, considering the high
volume of vehicles, lorries and both cargo and
passenger trains crossing common borders,
the risk of use of this modus operandi should
not be underestimated.
Composition of the flow
Member States detected more illegal border-crossings by regional nationalities (CIS*
countries and Georgia) than transiting nonregional ones. However, in relative terms
non-regional migrants more often tend to
use illegal border-crossing as the modus operandi to enter the EU. Moreover, there is a

qualitative difference in the purpose of illegal
border-crossing. As regards regional nationalities over one-third of cases were connected
with other reasons than irregular migration
(smuggling, other reasons), while in the case
of transiting flows originating outside of the
region, irregular migration was clearly the
main purpose of illegal entry.
In terms of nationalities reported by Member
States, Georgians (235) ranked first, mainly
detected at the Lithuanian-Belarusian border,
followed by Afghans (149, mainly at the Slovakian-Ukrainian border) and the Vietnamese (149, mainly at the Lithuanian-Belarusian
border). Syrian nationals were the fastest
growing detected nationality, though the
numbers of detections (114, or +208% in comparison with 2012 at all borders in question)
remained low in wider European context.

Main entry points
At common borders, in view of the data available from the both sides of the border, the busiest border sections in terms of detections of
illegal border-crossing between BCPs were the
Slovakian-Ukrainian (-13% in comparison with
2012) and the Lithuanian-Belarusian borders
(-2.7% compared with 2012). However, considering the Lithuanian-Belarusian border, it
should be noted that the share of detections
reported by Belarus rose, thus decreasing the
pressure at the EU-side of the border.
The largest increase reported by Member
States was +163% reported by Estonia (with no
data from the Russian Federation). However,
the growth resulted mainly from changes in
reporting. Moreover, only a minority of detections was connected with irregular migration.
Abuse of legal entry
In contrast to the relatively stable trend in detections of illegal border-crossings, the number of refusals of entry rose to over 50 000,
i.e. 39% of the EU total, indicating a growing
risk of abuse of legal travel channels. While
the increase in refusals of entry can be partly
explained by growing regular traffic, two
main individual phenomena stood out in 2013:
1.	A sharp increase in nationals of the Russian Federation of Chechen origin refused
entry and then using asylum applications
in Poland as a way to enter the EU and
move further to Germany.
2.	Continued flow of Georgian nationals to
Poland and further on to other Member
States by using a variety of modi operandi
from illegal border-crossing between BCPs
to the abuse of the asylum system.
The main entry point in both cases was
the Polish-Belarusian border, which issued
roughly half of the total number of refusals

20 of 50

in 2013 (it should be noted that some persons
were refused multiple times).
It can be assessed that the issue of migrants
who were refused entry and applied for asylum and who subsequently absconded from
reception centres was indeed the most serious phenomenon of irregular migration at
the common borders in 2013. While not attracting media attention and not putting the
lives of migrants at risk, the use of this modus operandi appears to be a significant entry channel of irregular migration to the EU.
It takes advantage of legal channels of entry but also creates considerable workload
for border guards at BCPs.
Document fraud
Unlike in the case of refusals of entry, detections of fraudulent documents at common borders were most commonly made
at the borders with Ukraine. Záhony BCP at
the Hungarian land border with Ukraine reported the most cases of document fraud on
entry to the EU / Schengen area.
Although there was a decreasing trend in detections, the most common type of fraudulent document remained counterfeit stamps
that were mostly used by Ukrainian nationals in order to conceal overstaying. Indeed,
in the case of Ukrainian nationals more persons were detected using false documents on
exit from Schengen area / EU than on entry.
The detections of fraudulent documents
by EB-RAN countries remained stable with
Ukraine reporting 69% of detections.

2.3. Institutional changes
Visa liberalisation process with Eastern
Partnership countries
The EU conducts ‘Visa Liberalisation Dialogues’ with three Eastern Partnership coun-

tries, namely Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia.
Through these dialogues, the EU is taking
gradual steps towards the long-term goal
of visa-free travel on a case-by-case basis,
provided that conditions for well-managed
and secure mobility are in place.*
Although only three out of the six Eastern
Partnership states, namely Moldova, Ukraine
and Georgia, have been granted Action Plans,
all the six countries, including Belarus, Armenia and Azerbaijan, have been working
towards visa liberalisation and meeting the
criteria.
In November 2013, the Commission proposed
to grant visa-free travel to the Schengen
area for Moldovan citizens holding a biometric passport. This proposal was built on the
successful implementation by the Republic
of Moldova of all the benchmarks set in its
Visa Liberalisation Action Plan. Visa liberalisation between the EU and Moldova entered
into force on 28 April 2014.
As there is already a considerable mobility between Moldova and Romania, fuelled
for example by a large number of Romanian
passport holders in Moldova and well-developed security features of Moldovan travel
documents, neither Moldova nor Romania
expect visa liberalisation to radically change
the operational environment at their common borders.
Possible general impacts of visa
liberalisations
Except for Moldova, the timetable leading to
actual visa liberalisation is not known, but
some consequences for border-control authorities can be outlined.
While visa liberalisation would promote and
ease cross-border traffic, it would also increase the workload of border authorities. In
the absence of a visa procedure, the nature

of the checks would change and the assessment of the validity of entry would fall fully
under the responsibility of border authorities.
The growth of regular traffic would be felt
mostly at land borders, but it would likely also
increase traffic on existing air and sea routes
as well as create new routes. In some cases
this might require establishing new BCPs.
As far as changes in modus operandi of irregular
migration are concerned, it is likely that the
abuse of legal entries would grow, increasing the number of refusals of entry.
As regards mitigation measures most investments should be directed to strengthen
border checks. These include measures that
are necessary even without visa liberalisations and – looking on the issue in the longer
term – are already included in the smart
borders package, including entry / exit system that would mitigate the risk of overstaying and use of forged stamps. Registered
Travellers Programmes (RTP) would help
to ensure smooth passenger traffic flows.
Coming to the border check procedures and
technology, the already existing and partly
implemented solutions such as Automated
Border Control, online queuing systems,
and changes in the flow of traffic through
the border checks (change from booths to
lanes and mobile devices) are among measures that could as well mitigate the pressure at BCPs.

* At an extraordinary
meeting on 6 March
2014, the European
Council decided to
suspend bilateral
talks with the Russian
Federation on visa
matters. This means that,
at the time of writing,
visa-free travel for
Russian citizens has been
postponed indefinitely.

The management of regular traffic flows as
well as identifying criminal activities among
it would also require continuous and smooth
information exchange between the authorities, including the Customs, on the both sides
of the border, as well as police and migration authorities inland. In this regard, the
activities of liaison officers could be broadened from visa issuance and border check
support to a wider co-operation in criminal
investigations, information exchange and
risk analysis.

Frontex · Eastern European Borders Annual Risk Analysis 2014

The roll-out of and impact of Visa
Information System and possible impacts
on local border traffic permits
Local border traffic agreements (LBTAs) provide for the issuance of permits entitling
border residents to cross an external border under the local border traffic regime. In
general LBT permits do not include other biometric identifiers besides the photograph
of the holder. In light of the mandatory introduction of fingerprint checks in the Visa
Information System at land borders from October 2014, there arises a question of whether
LBT permits will be still exempt from the requirement to provide fingerprints. Mandatory fingerprints in border checks will most
likely increase the average time spent at a
border check thus adding to the challenge
to keep the traffic smooth.

2.4. Environmental scan
Transit and origin countries
� Russian Federation
The Russian Federation is one of the largest receivers of migrants in the world, with
roughly 10 million foreign workers in the
country. The flow of irregular migration to
the Russian Federation, especially with the
intention to undertake unauthorised employment, continues at a large scale, too.
In fact two contradictory trends coexist in
the Russian migration policy. First, there is
a recognised need for foreign workforce in
the Russian Federation as well as plans to
free the movement of labour in the context
of the Common Economic Space and the
planned Eurasian Union. On the other hand,
there is an increasing popular and political
criticism against the use of foreign workforce reflected in the wide-scale police raids
against the migrants coming not just from

22 of 50

abroad, but also from the Northern Caucasus region of the Russian Federation.
Estimates of the foreign labour force in the
Russian Federation vary. The Russian Federal
Migration Service assesses the number of irregular labour migrants at roughly 3.5–4 million. Of these, a large majority have arrived in
the Russian Federation legally, but are working without permits.
The large number of irregular migrant workforce is explained by two factors. First, the
official quota for foreign workforce tends to
be significantly smaller than the demand for
labour. Secondly, visa freedom between CIS
countries and the Russian Federation makes
entering the Russian Federation legally easy,
after which it is relatively easy to find work.
The authorities have aimed to curb irregular migration by tightening legislation and
introducing heavier fines. For example, in
August 2013 new fines were introduced for
migrants detected for illegal stay in Moscow
and St Petersburg. According to these new
rules, persons without valid documents for
work or stay would be fined from RUB 5 000
to 7 000 (EUR ~110–160) and face deportation with an entry ban for five years.
Moreover, according to the new Russian regulations that came into force on 1 January
2014, foreigners – including citizens from
CIS countries – who lack long-term visas
can stay in the Russian Federation for 90
days in a 180-day period. Previously, it was
enough to cross the border in order to get a
new entry stamp to renew the 90-day permission. Violators are subject to a three-year
ban on entering the Russian Federation. For
those who are working in the Russian Federation without permission this may create
an incentive to develop new modi operandi to
circumvent this rule, such as falsifying entry / exit stamps.

In addition to the new regulations, the migration issue became increasingly politicised in 2013. Two large anti-migrant riots
in Moscow in 2013 – in August and October
– were followed by the Russian authorities’
raids on work places and accommodation
of illegally working migrants. The police
discovered, for example, garment factories with irregular foreign workforce. Many
detainees were Vietnamese, but included
Egyptian and Syrian nationals, too. Many
Vietnamese migrants had been working illegally in Russia’s textile industry for years,
often in conditions of near-slavery. According to open sources, several thousands of
migrants were detained.
These intensified raids on irregular migrants could trigger more movements towards EB-RAN countries and the EU. If the
current economic downturn in the Russian
Federation continues – due to the crisis in
Ukraine and possible further sanctions on
the Russian Federation – and has a negative
impact on the labour market, migrants may
start to look for new destinations. The most
likely groups possibly attempting to search
for work in the EU could include groups with
significant diasporas both in the EU and the
Russian Federation, including nationals of
Vietnam. During the previous economic depression in 2009 the migrants originating
from the CIS area mostly opted to return to
their home countries.
In the North Caucasus region the situation
remains tense especially in Dagestan, which
has witnessed most political violence in the
Russian Federation in recent years. Although
Chechnya has been relatively calm, instability in the region as a whole has increased
as militants moved over from Chechnya to
other republics. Dagestan is also one the
poorest areas of the Russian Federation
and has one of the youngest populations
in the country. Continued attempts of nationals of the Russian Federation from the

Northern Caucasus region to enter the EU
either for security or economic reasons are
therefore likely.
Selected countries of origin
Nationals of a wide variety of countries
are detected for irregular migration using EB-RAN countries mainly as a transit
area. In terms of possible changes in 2014
two countries can be highlighted: Syria and
Afghanistan.
� Syria
The complex dynamics of the civil war in
Syria – which includes ethnic, religious and
sectarian overtones, plus influential regional
geopolitics not to mention Islamist extremism – will continue to contribute to the protraction of any political resolution to the
conflict. The reign of terror plus other socio-economic considerations, including the
extent of urban tenements’ destruction, will
hinder returns back home at least in the short
to medium term.
With no end of the conflict in sight, considering the atrocities committed, difficult conditions in refugee camps, cities and towns, and
no viable framework for a realistic political
transition, Syrians will increasingly consider
and eventually likely opt to leave their current place of refuge (over 2.5 million Syrians
are already registered as refugees outside
Syria – UNHCR) in order to secure a better
future for their families.
Migratory pressure on the EU’s external borders as well as EB-RAN countries’ borders
is bound to continue as larger numbers of
Syrian nationals, and those claiming to be
of Syrian nationality, will seek different options beyond finding refuge in the countries
immediately bordering Syria. In the CIS region, Armenia and the Russian Federation
are the most likely destinations with possi-

ble secondary movements towards the EU.
Therefore, continued inflows through multiple border sections should be expected.
� Afghanistan
Afghanistan is currently in the middle of a
complicated transition in key fields of security, the economy and institutions. The successes or failures of this transition are closely
felt by the Afghan society and are also impacting the patterns of emigration.

* UN High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR),
Volrep and Border
Monitoring Monthly Update,
December 2013, available

[accessed 13 June 2014]

There are already signs that the uncertainty
about Afghanistan’s future has reversed
years of decline in the outflow of refugees,
in which returning Afghans consistently outnumbered those fleeing. The number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) is growing
and is currently estimated at some 600 000.
The number of voluntary returns is declining,
too. According to UNHCR, a total of 94 000
Afghans returned to Afghanistan voluntarily
in 2012, but in 2013 this figure fell to roughly
38 000.* It also seems that the number of
Afghan asylum seekers is growing again.
According to the Afghan Ministry of Refugees and Repatriations, the most recent
figures show 60 000 Afghan asylum seekers in 2013 in Western and other industrialised countries.
Indeed, it is estimated that Afghanistan currently has a net outflow of people, in numbers
not seen since 2001. Still, the future scale of
outward migration from Afghanistan is still
depending on the success of the complex
transition in the area of security, the economy and institutions. Moreover, the scale of
migration outside of the region depends on
the policies of Iran and Pakistan in relation
to Afghan migrants.
The lead responsibility for security in Afghanistan has, since 2013, gradually been transitioned from the NATO-led International
Security Assistance Force (ISAF) to the Af-

24 of 50

ghan National Security Forces (ANSF). The
aim is for Afghan forces to have full responsibility for security across the country by the
end of 2014.
At the end of 2013 it was clear that security situation in Afghanistan continued to
be highly volatile. Afghan forces were able
to respond to attacks and mostly held on.
While the Taliban’s assassination campaign
did take a heavy toll on police officials and
lower-level district officials, it is assessed
that it did not succeed in breaking the central government’s ability to function. Most
of the fighting remained in the eastern and
southern parts of Afghanistan and was waged
outside large cities.
At the same time, the Taliban did not show
signs of weakening either. The Afghan security forces were not able to make significant gains and also suffered heavy casualties
that, according to unofficial sources, may
have doubled since last year. According to
the CSIS, total ISAF and ANSF casualties are
now in fact far higher than at any previous
moment in the war, in spite of the fact that
the ISAF’s share of casualties is now negligible. In the southern rural areas of Afghanistan, the insurgents’ continued appearance
as the more credible military force out of cities added weight to theories that the Taliban
could be controlling those areas after 2014.
Although the ANSF did succeed mostly to
contain Taliban advances in 2013, the targeted killing of public officials and civilians
indicates that a growing group of Afghan
citizens are under increasing personal security threat.
Facing the possible decrease of foreign aid, it
is also assessed that incomes from drug-trade
will be increasingly important. According to
UNOCD, opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan reached a record high in 2013. In 2013
the cultivation amounted to some 209 000

hectares, a 36% increase over 2012. Moreover, two provinces that had previously been
declared poppy-free in northern Afghanistan lost this status. All in all, opium production in 2013 went up to some 5 500 tonnes,
a 49% increase over 2012. In 2013 opium exports represented roughly 14% of the GDP of
the country. As the level of opium production
has tended to correlate with low development
and high insecurity, the future prospects are
worrying. This would also affect the countries on the export routes of the drugs – including Central Asian CIS countries and the
Russian Federation.

To conclude, it is likely that the problems
encountered in all fields of transition will
increase internal displacement, decrease voluntary returns and increase emigration from
Afghanistan. In the past, a great majority of
the Afghans leaving the country were able to
find means of living in Iran or Pakistan. The
current increasing reluctance of the governments of these two countries to receive
Afghan migrants and refugees is, however,
making this option less viable. This in turn is
likely to increase the likelihood of attempts of
secondary irregular movements out of the region, impacting among others the CIS region.

3. Annual risk assessment 2014
The following risk assessment is guided by
the CIRAM working definition of risk as a
function of three main components: threat,
vulnerability and impact. A systematic examination of each component allows for classifying risks into categories of significance.
Establishing a general context in which border
authorities from EB-RAN countries and the
neighbouring Member States operated during 2013 is therefore important for identifying
the main border (regional and common) security risks. To narrow down the selection, a
detailed analysis of the available monthly statistical data (both FRAN and EB-RAN), Frontex operational data, bi-monthly reports and
previous EB-RAN annual risk analyses was
performed. The following three main risks
have been identified:

26 of 50

1.	Risk of cross-border smuggling and exploitation of green / blue borders as a point of
entry for smuggled goods (smuggling of
tobacco products, precursors and drugs,
stolen vehicles, and other goods);
2.	Risk of significant transiting irregular migration flows originating outside of the
wider EB-RAN region (e.g. ‘non-regional’
irregular migrants from Africa, the Middle East, Asia, Latin America);
3.	Risk of sustained irregular migration flows
originating from the EB-RAN region, including CIS countries and Georgia.
Each identified risk is described in detail, broken down by its main components.

3.1. R
 isk of cross-border
smuggling and exploitation
of green  /  blue borders
as a point of entry for
smuggled goods (smuggling
of tobacco products,
precursors and drugs,
stolen vehicles, and other
goods)
3.1.1. Description of the threat
EB-RAN data, as well as information from
Frontex-coordinated Joint Operations supported by open-source information, indicates that cross-border criminality, mainly
large- and small-scale smuggling of excise
goods, trafficking in stolen vehicles and the
smuggling of drugs remain the most significant threat to border security at the common land borders.
Due to the legal and institutional characteristics, national Border Guard authorities along
the EU eastern border have different types and
degrees of responsibility in the fight against
cross-border crime. Moreover, the nature and
extent of inter-agency cooperation at the external borders differs greatly between these
countries. Typically, preventing the smuggling of goods falls more under the responsibility of Customs authorities than border
guards. Nevertheless, border guards regularly have to react and engage in combating
these criminal activities, especially along the
green borders. Indeed, according to statistical data, at some border sections the smuggling of goods seems to be a more frequent
reason for illegal border-crossing than reasons related to migration.
Smuggling of excise goods
As a response to the euro and financial crisis of the last years, many EU governments
increased their taxes on excise goods. Between July 2012 and 2013, at least ten Mem-

ber States increased their duties on cigarettes,
on average by EUR 0.33 per pack of the ‘Most
popular price category’, as defined by the European Commission.*
Currently, the customer would pay EUR 5
for an average pack of cigarettes in Finland,
whereas across the Russian border, the same
pack would cost him only around EUR 1.5. Not
only individual consumers and small-scale
smugglers from economically weak border
regions try to take advantage of existing
price differences. Large-scale criminal businesses illicitly import large amounts of cigarettes hidden on cargo trains and in lorries.

Legally binding agreements signed by the EU
and the four largest tobacco manufacturers
with the intention to address the problem
of contraband cigarettes and to prevent the
oversupply of third-country markets effectively cover international brands and 80% of
the world market. However, many factories
producing counterfeit cigarettes and ‘cheap
whites’ are not concerned by the limitations
and the tracking system provided by these
agreements.
Less prominent companies outside the EU still
sell large quantities to third-country markets,
where only an insignificant share of these
cigarettes can be absorbed by the local demand. Much of the rest is then smuggled out
to Member States. In particular, seizures of
‘cheap white’ brands have been showing a
strong upward tendency over the past few
years. An example is the Jin Ling cigarette
brand produced in Kaliningrad, which grew
so popular among western consumers that
this brand itself is being counterfeit.
Although cigarette prices have recently also
increased in the eastern neighbourhood of
the EU, the smuggling of cigarettes from Belarus, Moldova, Ukraine and the Russian Federation remained highly profitable and fuelled
the growth of transnational organised crime

27 of 50

Frontex · Eastern European Borders Annual Risk Analysis 2014

groups active in that business. Surprisingly,
in Belarus, retail sales in 2012 increased despite of the upward price development. According to open sources, a large share of the
risen demand was caused by ‘private exports’
to countries of the EU.
In 2013, most illicit cigarettes detected in the
context of Frontex Joint Operations were
smuggled across the eastern borders of the
EU. In this context, more than 26.8 million cigarettes were seized in 374 incidents. A majority of detections were related to smaller
amounts of cigarettes smuggled by residents
of the border regions or other frequently
travelling individuals. Excluding 10% of the
largest seizures, an average of 40 cartons of
illicit cigarettes were detected by the border authorities. The contraband was predominantly hidden in specially constructed
concealed compartments in vehicles. Accordingly, around two-thirds of all detections at
common borders were made in private cars
or vans, and 13% on public buses.
The contraband of petroleum products was
mainly reported from the eastern EU borders with Belarus, the Russian Federation and
Ukraine. This illegal activity was fuelled by
the price difference between Member States
and their third-country neighbours. In many
cases, the smugglers crossed the border several times a week to fill up the large or illegally extended petrol tanks of their private
vehicles. This type of contraband, commonly
known as ‘ant smuggling’, did not only cause
substantial fiscal losses, but also increased
the workload of border guards significantly.
Fuel smugglers were, to a large extent, responsible for long border queues at the BCPs
at common borders. Member States like Estonia, Poland and Slovakia are currently taking measures to prevent that individuals cross
the borders on a regular basis to import fuel
for other than private use. Travellers arriving
in Estonia by car, for example, may now bring
fuel exempt from excise duty in the quantity

28 of 50

of one regular fuel tank only at the first entry within a calendar month.
Exit of stolen vehicles
According to Eurostat, the total number of
vehicles, including cars, motor cycles, buses,
lorries, construction and agricultural vehicles, stolen in the EU has been steadily falling from 1.85 million in 1998 to 0.88 million
in 2010. Among the reasons were the development of advanced technical anti-theft
measures and intensified international lawenforcement cooperation.
Only a small share of the vehicles stolen in
the EU is detected at its external borders,
often in the context of Frontex Joint Operations. In contrast to the overall theft statistics, detections at the borders reported to
Frontex have been slightly rising from 498 in
2012 to 519 in 2013, around 60% of these at
the EU’s eastern borders. The increase was
mainly caused by a rise in awareness and related expertise of Frontex Guest Officers and
regular border guards.
Most car thefts were detected by queries in
the SIS II, INTERPOL and national theft databases for the Vehicle Identification Number
(VIN) specified on the engine, frame and major parts of most motor vehicles. Car thieves
applied various modi operandi to cloud the
identity of their stolen vehicles at the external borders, such as through manipulation of
the VIN number. In other cases, vehicles were
disassembled into parts to obscure identification or powers of attorney containing an authorisation to travel abroad were counterfeit.
The above mentioned modi operandi were
regularly reported at the EU’s eastern borders, where detections of stolen vehicles on
exit increased from 289 in 2012 to 313 in 2013.
The vehicle brand preferences did not change
during the last years, as around 40% of the
cars detected were produced by Volkswa-

gen, Mercedes Benz and BMW. The majority
of persons driving stolen vehicles were nationals of the country to which they intended
to leave the EU. For example, 131 of the 192
persons attempting to transfer their stolen
vehicle to Ukraine were of Ukrainian nationality, only 35 were EU citizens.
Most cases were reported from the Ukrainian border, with numbers slightly decreasing

from 189 in 2012 to 175 in 2013. The majority
of the cars stopped on their way to Ukraine
were stolen in Italy (26%), Germany (20%)
and Spain (9%). Most stolen vehicles were
about to leave the EU through Polish BCPs
to Ukraine, particularly Medyka and Korczowa, which are situated at or in proximity to
the economically important European Route
E40 that connects Western Europe with the
countries of Central Asia.

With 70 detections of stolen vehicles in 2013,
numbers reported from the Belarusian border
remained stable in comparison to 2012. Moreover, Belarusian authorities reported frequent
attempts to avoid import duties for both
bought and stolen vehicles through the use
of Belarusian vehicle documents and number plates belonging to ‘twin’ vehicles of similar appearance and technical specifications.
Another way to evade import duties involved
EU citizens requesting a duty-free temporary
admission and subsequently transferring the
vehicle to a Belarusian national.

incidents were part of a temporary surge or
represented an emerging trend.

Border guards deployed at the EU external
borders to Ukraine and Belarus registered
further increase in the number of motorbikes stolen in Italy. As reported to Frontex, the phenomenon spread to an extent
that this vehicle type represented more than
74% of all Italian stolen vehicles detected at
the border to Ukraine in 2013. From Italy,
where the motorbikes were disassembled
and loaded onto buses and vans, organised
crime groups took the shortest routes and
entered Ukraine from Hungary or the south
of Poland. Most motorbikes were identified
at the BCPs of Záhony and Medyka, being
the nearest BCPs from Italy.

Authorities and international organisations
have observed that the northern route leading through Central Asia and the Russian
Federation is continuously used to supply
markets of both the EU and its eastern neighbours. One reason for the lasting significance
of this route is presumably related to the establishment of the Customs Union of Belarus,
Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation. According to EMCDDA and Europol, Lithuanian
organised crime groups have access to the
heroin trafficked via Central Asian countries
through their Russian crime connections and
therefore play an important role in its distribution in north-eastern Europe.

Smuggling of illicit drugs

An international operation in October 2013
conducted in the Afghan Badakhshan province caused a major blow to opiate trade
along the northern route. Afghanistan’s antidrug police in cooperation with the Russian
drug control service and with support of the
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration raided
two drug laboratories and seized more than
4.7 tonnes of opiates and 1.2 tonnes of opium
poppy seeds.*

Towards the end of 2013, border authorities have seen a spate of cannabis smuggled
from Poland to Belarus and Ukraine. Belarusian and Polish Border Guards reported
that only between September and December they detected six major trafficking cases
leading to the seizure of the total amount of
around 230 kg of cannabis. In the largest of
these cases, a resident of St Petersburg attempted to smuggle 90 kg of cannabis in a
concealed compartment of his private vehicle. Also late in 2013, the Polish Border Guard
seized 175 kg of hashish, which Russian nationals intended to traffic to Ukraine. The
coming months will show whether these

While, according to estimates of UNODC, the
use of heroin generally decreased in the EU,
substantial seizures of the substance were
reported from the EU’s eastern borders. In
one of the cases uncovered in March 2013,
Belarusian police and Customs authorities
seized more than 85 kg of heroin at the BCP
of Kotlovka at the Lithuanian-Belarusian border. The substance was smuggled hidden in
a semitrailer driven by a Moldovan citizen.

Regarding amphetamines, the Russian Federation is assessed to be one of the most
important source countries of the precursor chemical 1-phenyl-2-propanone (BMK), a
colourless or slightly yellow oily liquid. BMK is
systematically smuggled across the EU east-

ern borders to amphetamine production sites
in the EU. Significant production of amphetamines was reported by Poland and the Baltic
countries. Amphetamines produced in the EU
are trafficked extensively within the EU and,
to a lesser extent, across its eastern borders.
In the other direction of drug flow the Russian Federation and, to a lesser extent, Belarus
and Ukraine have become destination countries of synthetic drugs and cocaine smuggled
from and via the EU. A significant number of
seizures in Central Europe suggest that cocaine from South America is increasingly trafficked to eastern markets within and outside
the EU. According to EMCDDA, the proportion of cocaine seizures in ten countries located at the EU’s eastern border increased
from a very low level of 0.1% in 2001 to 1.8%
in 2011. The EU Drug Markets Report 2013
thus highlights the Eastern Baltic Sea area as
potentially an emerging cocaine entry point.
3.1.3. Mitigation
Changes in legislation
Adjustments of legislation and introduction
of limitations for the import of excise goods

may give border officials the authority to
tackle small-scale fuel or cigarette smuggling at BCPs. It would, moreover, reduce the
workload of border authorities.
Close cooperation between bordercontrol authorities and Customs services
The detection of drugs and smuggled excise
goods requires a close cooperation between
border-control authorities and customs
services.
Improved international cooperation
The exchange of information on criminal
groups, modi operandi and stolen property
would assist border guards in the detection
of cross-border crime. Access to INTERPOL databases on stolen vehicles should be
enhanced.
Capacity building and procurement of
technical equipment
Enhancing technical equipment at BCPs would
improve the efficiency of border guards’ work
in the identification of stolen vehicles and machinery, as well as (synthetic) drugs.

3.2. Risk of significant
transiting irregular
migration flows originating
outside of the wider
EB-RAN region
3.2.1. Description of the threat
EB-RAN countries are used as a transit area
to the EU by irregular migrants originating
from outside of the region, including the Middle East, South Asia and South East Asia. In
addition to illegal entries, these transit flows
often include further irregular secondary
movements within the EU as the main destination countries are usually situated further
inside the area of free movement.
However, the magnitude of this threat of
transiting flow has remained relatively small
when compared, for example, with routes
transiting Turkey or North African countries.
Arguably this is because migrants travelling
along the route via EB-RAN countries or the
Russian Federation face: (a) more logistic
difficulties and higher costs; (b) efficiently
cooperating border-control authorities on
both sides of common borders; and, therefore, (c) a high risk of detection.
Still, the risk of transit use of the EB-RAN region, including the Russian Federation, should
not be underestimated, especially considering
the growing volume of international travel
in the region, major cities near the borders
(especially in the Russian Federation), evolving labour markets in the Russian Federation and the difficult situation in some of
the major origin countries of migrants using this route, such as Afghanistan. Moreover, although EB-RAN countries as such do
not form a unified transiting ‘route’ towards
the EU, there are links between phenomena
experienced at the different border sections
along common borders, indicating that facilitators are actively searching for vulnerable border sections.

32 of 50

It is likely that most of the migrants arrive
in the region (EB-RAN countries and  /  or the
Russian Federation) legally or by abusing legal entries with fraudulently obtained visas
and stay for varying times either irregularly
or legally. In essence, migrants have then four
main options of illegal entry to Member States
from EB-RAN countries: (a) illegal bordercrossing of the land border between BCPs;
(b) clandestine entry through BCPs; (c) use
of false documents at BCPs; and (d) abuse of
legal travel channels.
It can be assessed that the option of illegal
border-crossing between BCPs continued
as the main modus operandi used by nonregional migrants (in contrast to regional
ones, with the exception of Georgians), although the number of detections decreased
slightly in relation to 2012.
New developments
� Illegal border-crossings between BCPs
Magnitude of the threat
Member States reported 663 detections of
illegal border-crossing by non-regional migrants at common borders and borders with
the Russian Federation, which was 25% less
compared to 2012 (886), but still 109% more
compared to 2011 (317). In all cases the direction was towards the EU.
Illegal border-crossings reported on both
sides of common borders (with available data
for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine) show, in
relative terms, a slightly smaller 21% decrease
from 1 308 in 2012 to 1 035 in 2013.
The drop was mostly due to a sharp decrease
in Somali nationals detected by Slovakia. Secondly, the drop in detections by Member
States was made sharper by increased detections in Belarus at its border with Lithuania,

thus decreasing the relative share of detections at the Lithuanian side of the border.
Routes
As regards the routes, the Slovakian-Ukrainian border remained the busiest in terms of
detections of illegal border-crossing by the
non-regional nationals. This border section
was followed by the Lithuanian-Belarusian
border. The northernmost section of common borders (Finland, Norway) remained
peaceful in terms of illegal border-crossings, with only four detections of non-regional migrants, all Syrian nationals in 2013.
Modus operandi
According to EB-RAN experts, the process
of illegal border-crossing by non-regional
migrants is increasingly facilitated, consists
of several legs and involves several criminal
groups or hired local drivers etc. taking care
of particular sections of the journey on both
sides of common borders. Thus, people detected transporting the migrants are not
necessary facilitators. Detections of mixed
groups of different nationalities also continued in 2013, indicating that facilitators
were able to attract clients from many different countries.
Seasonality
When detections at both common and regional borders are put together, a clear seasonality can be observed with the threat of
illegal border-crossing peaking in July-August.
However, in individual countries there were
highly diverse trends. For example in Estonia,
the top months of detections in 2013 were
the months of January, February and October. The possible increase in attempted green
border crossings during wintertime increases
the risk of loss of life, especially in the case
of nationalities that may not be aware of the
dangers of harsh winter conditions.

Composition of the flow
Trends considering individual nationalities
differed considerably in 2013, depending on
a variety of push and pull factors, including
the developments in origin countries, changing situation on the routes leading to the EU,
and operational responses by the EU and EBRAN country authorities.
Afghans were the top nationality detected
for illegal border-crossing between BCPs in
2013 although their trend was decreasing.
At common and regional borders the number of detections dropped by 20% to 263 in
2013. The drop was mostly due to fewer detections made by Poland, but in other reporting countries the trend was relatively stable.
The threat of illegal border-crossings by Afghans can be assessed to remain at least
stable in 2014 due to the ongoing security
transition in Afghanistan and the uncertainties it produces.
The detections of nationals of Vietnam at
common and regional borders (209 in 2013)
grew by 8% compared with 193 in 2012. In
fact, illegal border-crossing between BCPs
on the eastern border route was clearly the
preferred option for the nationals of Vietnam
to enter the EU, with only individual cases recorded on the Western Balkans and Eastern
Mediterranean routes over the recent years.
The reasons for the continuing popularity of
the eastern border route among the Vietnamese are likely to include:
a)	Significant Vietnamese communities in
the Russian Federation, EB-RAN countries as well as Member States.
b)	V ietnamese organised crime groups operating in the EU as well as in the Russian
Federation and EB-RAN countries, creating the demand for irregular workforce.

33 of 50

Frontex · Eastern European Borders Annual Risk Analysis 2014

c)	Different approaches on visa issuance to
Vietnamese nationals by the Russian Federation and Belarus, making it possible for
the Vietnamese to seek entry first to the
Russian Federation and further to Belarus and the proximity of EU borders.
Additionally, the recent activity of the Russian Migration Service in closing some garment factories with Vietnamese irregular
workforce may have triggered some of these
movements.
The arrival, stay and employment of Vietnamese citizens in the Russian Federation is
usually facilitated by Vietnamese networks.
There are also indications that Russian visas
were obtained under false pretences to enter the Russian Federation.

Vietnamese nationals mostly cross the border to the EU facilitated, though it should be
noted that facilitators detected by border authorities are usually not Vietnamese, but include a variety of regional nationalities, such
as Armenians. Indeed, although the crime
groups behind the movements are likely to
be Vietnamese, they tend to ‘outsource’ facilitation of these irregular movements to
other crime groups. After reaching the EU,
Vietnamese migrants are quickly transported
in cars towards Poland, Germany and possibly further on to France and the UK, which
together with Cyprus are the top five countries reporting detections of illegal stay of
Vietnamese citizens.
Syrians became the third most common nonregional nationality detected for illegal border-crossing (+208%), with 114 detections in
2013 compared with 37 in 2012 and only 11 in
2011. The growing trend is clear and somewhat
expected due to the war in Syria and the resulting large population displacements and
refugee flows. The entry points also showed
more variation. While in 2011 detections of
Syrians at common borders were reported

just by two countries, in 2013 the detections
were already spread over the borders of eleven
countries.
In many detected cases Syrian migrants
and  /  or facilitators had links to the Armenian Syrian community. This is due to the
recent flow of Syrian citizens  /  refugees of Armenian origin to Armenia and close links between Armenia and EB-RAN countries and
the Russian Federation.
Despite the growth in detections of illegal
border-crossing by Syrian nationals, their
level remained low when put in the wider
EU context. This may be explained, first, by
still relatively low flow of Syrian refugees to
EB-RAN countries. Indeed, the number of
asylum applications by Syrian nationals in
the three EB-RAN countries together was
only 98 in 2013. However, according to open
sources, the number of applications is rising in the Russian Federation with roughly
1 000 applications in 2013, of which roughly
500 were accepted only in Moscow.
Another factor is that Syrian citizens arriving
in the CIS region with the intention to continue further to the EU are opting for other
modi operandi, such as the use of air routes. For
example, according to PULSAR data*, Moscow airports, and to lesser extent Kiev, are
used as departure points of asylum Syrian
asylum applicants arriving in the EU.
There are also indications that Syrian citizens
of Armenian ethnic background are able to
obtain Armenian passports fairly easily, which
enables them to travel legally in the CIS area
without visas and also apply for visas with
Armenian passports. For border authorities
legal entries with legal passports are as such
not a problem.
In contrast to Syrians, the number of detections of Somali nationals went down sharply
by 79%, from 342 detections in 2012 to only

73 in 2013 at common and regional borders,
which explains the overall drop in detections
of transiting migrants at common borders.
The decline was mainly due to a sharp decrease in detections at the Slovakian-Ukrainian border.
� I llegal border-crossing at BCPs
(clandestine entries)
The detection of clandestine entries of nonregional nationalities (excluding both CIS and
EU nationals) has been limited to individual
cases at common borders. Most of the detections were made at regional borders. Moreover, only a minority of the cases reported
were related to irregular migration.
Due to the growing regular traffic flow of
goods in lorries and trains, the detection of
this modus operandi may become more challenging and should not be underestimated.
� False documents
Excluding the increase of detected false
Swedish documents and, to a lesser extent,
Syrian passports, which may be linked to the
increased irregular entries by Syrian nationals, there were no major new phenomena as
regards the use of false documents by nonregional migrants detected at the common
land borders. Considering the widely reported
use of forged EU documents by nationals
of West and Central African countries the
number of detections decreased sharply in
2013. It is likely that the increased cooperation between border authorities in identifying forged EU documents made this modus
operandi increasingly unsuccessful.
� Abuse of legal travel channels

by the Member States located at the eastern borders of the EU. Similar methods are
also likely to be used in EB-RAN countries.
However, while these modi operandi are probably very commonly used to enter legally and
then subsequently stay illegally in the EU, they
are often not linked with common borders,
which is the focus of this report.
In fact, at common borders and Member
State borders with the Russian Federation
the number of refusals reported by Member
States for the non-regional migrants was
just 429, which indicates a relatively low risk
of abuse of legal travel channels by non-regional migrants (in contrast to regional migrants). It should, however, be noted that
the number of refusals at the borders reveals only a part of the phenomenon, as it
does not include persons that have been refused visas in Member States’ consulates in
EB-RAN countries or refused entry to international trains or ferries by transport
companies, for example due to the lack of
a valid visa.
According to EB-RAN experts, visa abuse
cases tend to require a lot of effort from
border authorities, for example, to verify
claimed travel plans, supporting documentation etc.
3.2.3. Impact
Loss of life (increased illegal bordercrossing in winter)
Attempts to cross the border illegally in winter
time can be fatal, especially for persons who
may not be fully aware of or prepared for the
risks it includes as the death of a Sudanese
national in January 2014 in Estonia proved.

Attempts to abuse legal travel channels, especially visa issuance, are regularly documented

Labour exploitation and trafficking of
human beings (especially Vietnamese
nationals)
In the EU, Vietnamese irregular migrants
have been found working, for example, in
nail bars, as gardeners in cannabis plantations and as couriers of methamphetamine.
There is indeed an increased risk of trafficking in human beings accompanying the phenomenon of Vietnamese irregular migration
through common borders. It should be noted
that according to information received from
Member States, the Vietnamese are among
the nationalities most commonly detected
as victims of human trafficking in the EU.
Time consuming second-line checks in
visa abuse cases
Validating a long string of travel plans, work
contracts etc. in second-line checks with limited availability of interpreters creates additional workload at BCPs.

36 of 50

3.2.4. Mitigation
Strengthening  /  creating contact points in order to ensure timely common responses in illegal border-crossing cases.
It was highlighted by experts of EB-RAN
countries, especially Belarus, that creating
and strengthening of contact points between
EB-RAN countries and Member States border authorities facilitate timely common operational responses in illegal border-crossing
cases.
Cooperation in investigations
Cooperation between neighbouring countries
and with destination countries in ongoing investigations against facilitators  /  organised
crime groups is vital, especially considering
their increasing organisational flexibility. The
same applies for cooperation between border
authorities on falsified documents. Also the
enhanced use of advance passenger information at BCPs, including cooperation with
transport (railway, bus) companies would facilitate advance recognition of potential risk
passengers.

3.3. Risk of sustained irregular
migration flows from the
EB-RAN region, including
CIS countries and Georgia
3.3.1. Description of the threat
The threat of irregular migration flows originating from the EB-RAN region, including
the Russian Federation, CIS countries and
Georgia, contains a variety of different migration motives and modi operandi. This is natural
due to the geographic proximity, large regular traffic flows and wide labour migration.
Although there are important variations between nationalities, the following main trends
are clear: (a) the threat of illegal border-crossings for migration purposes remains relatively
low, while (b) the threat of abuse of legal
travel channels (asylum misuse, overstaying,
obtaining visas under false pretences) is on a
much higher level.
Even though the abuse of legal travel channels  /  entries may not be facilitated in the
meaning that persons are guided through the
border, individual parts of the journey of irregular migrants are facilitated starting from
production of fraudulent supporting documents to taxi drivers arranging further intraEU movements. As these facilitating acts are
usually not connected with the time of actual border-crossing, they are challenging to
identify and prosecute by border authorities.
New developments
� Illegal border-crossing
Two main issues should be stressed when analysing the data on illegal border-crossing by
regional migrants. First, it is clear that, in contrast to transiting non-regional migrants, illegal border-crossing of regional migrants is,
in relative terms, less often connected with
irregular migration, but rather with other,

usually economic, activities. Secondly, the
data need to be read carefully as the reporting countries may still have different practices in reporting the purpose of the illegal
border-crossing.
In 2013 the number of detected illegal border-crossings by regional migrants decreased
slightly. Member States reported a 4% decrease (683 detections in 2013). Considering
both sides of the common borders (with available data for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine)
there was also a 3% decrease (1 571 detections
in 2013). Both abovementioned figures are in
line with the gradually decreasing trend observed during the previous years that can be
attributed to the widening legal travel channels and changes in modi operandi of irregular migration.
Considering the main entry points, the trend
was relatively stable both at the LithuanianBelarusian border and the Slovakian-Ukrainian borders.
At regional borders the most affected border
sections remained the Ukrainian-Moldovan
and Ukrainian-Russian border sections, both
seeing decreases of 28% and 10%, respectively. However, it should be reiterated that
at the regional borders most cases of illegal
border-crossing can be attributed to local inhabitants and are largely not connected with
migration, but rather with smuggling activities, illegal logging, fishing or hunting. This
also explains the fact that a great majority
of the detected illegal border-crossings are
made by the nationals of the countries sharing the border. For example, at the Belarusian-Ukrainian border, nationals of Belarus
and Ukraine accounted for 95% of all detections of illegal border-crossing.
There were no major changes in modus operandi of illegal border-crossing observed in
2013. The border is usually crossed in small
groups of 2–3 persons or individually. Regional

37 of 50

Frontex · Eastern European Borders Annual Risk Analysis 2014

migrants rarely use facilitation (with the exception of Georgian nationals); they are prepared and equipped with maps, compasses,
change of clothes and they are often able to
communicate in Russian, which helps in making the journey without facilitators.

In the first two cases the main entry point
was the Polish-Belarusian border. However,
there were some notable differences in the
modus operandi used by different nationalities,
mostly deriving from their different motives
of attempting irregular entry.

� Abuse of legal travel channels

a) Citizens of the Russian Federation

In contrast to the threat of illegal bordercrossing, the magnitude of the threat of the
abuse of legal travel channels is at a much
higher level. The number of refusals of entry reported by Member States at common
land borders reached 50 000 in 2013, mainly
due to strong growth of refusals at the Polish land borders.

For irregular migrants from the Russian Federation the abuse of legal travel channels
was clearly the main modus operandi to enter
the EU irregularly. In 2013 there were just 147
Russian citizens detected for illegal bordercrossing between BCPs reported by Member
States at common land borders, including the
land border with the Russian Federation, of
which only 37 were connected with irregular migration. In contrast, roughly 20 000
refusals of entry were issued to Russian citizens at these borders (some Russians were
refused more than once).

While a considerable part of the refusals
were not necessarily connected with irregular migration (some were simply the result
of accidental attempts to cross the border
with expired visas, etc. with no intention of
cheating border authorities), three major phenomena of abuse of legal travel channels at
common borders stood out in 2013:
1.	A sharp increase in nationals of the Russian
Federation of Chechen origin using asylum
applications in Poland as a way of entering the EU to travel further on to Germany
with the intention to file another asylum
application and subsequently overstay.
2.	Continued flow of Georgian nationals to
Poland and further on to other Member
States using a variety of modi operandi.
3.	Continued abuse of visas in order to work
irregularly and  /  or overstay in other Member States than that stated in the visa,
mainly by EB-RAN country nationals, especially Ukrainians.
Additionally there were other smaller phenomena reported by other regional CIS country
nationals, mostly impacting regional borders.

38 of 50

Despite the large magnitude of the threat of
abuse of legal travel channels, the phenomenon in 2013 had a limited geographic and temporal scope: the sharp rise in refusals of entry
issued to Russians was geographically constrained mostly to Poland. It peaked sharply
in April–June and involved a specific group of
Russian nationals originating from the North
Caucasus region, mainly Chechnya.
The main entry point was clearly the PolishBelarusian border: of the total number of almost 23 000 refused nationals of the Russian
Federation at all EU borders, including air borders, over 60% were refused there. As Figure 10 shows, the rise in refusals at the land
borders was mainly confined to the PolishBelarusian border.
This in turn led to highly diverse refusal rates
at different border sections, when the number of refusals is compared with the number
of regular entries. In per capita terms the rate
of refusals was a hundred times larger at the

Polish-Belarusian border than, for example,
at the Estonian and Finnish borders with the
Russian Federation.

Figure 10. Refusals of entry by Member States at common borders
and land borders with the Russian Federation show a sharp increase
at Polish borders in 2013 but fairly stable trend at other borders
sections

The rise of refusals at the Polish-Belarusian
border was connected to the modus operandi
and route of nationals of the Russian Federation of Chechen origin aiming to reach
Germany and apply for asylum there. They
usually travelled in family units and arrived
at the Polish BCPs without valid visas. After
being refused entry by Poland most of the
migrants applied for asylum. However, after
the start of the asylum procedure many of
them quickly absconded from reception centres and continued towards Germany, thus
using asylum application in Poland mainly as
an entry method to the EU.

Refusals of entry issued to citizens of the Russian Federation by neighbouring Member
States 2011-2013

The reasons behind this sudden and large
increase are not fully understood. Although
security and economic situation in Chechnya
and Northern Caucasus region as a whole is
in many ways problematic, no major changes
in the politics, security or economy in the region can be identified that could have possibly acted as a sudden push factor triggering
the flow. The fact that some persons were
refused entry several times indicates that all
migrants were not always aware of the asylum option when arriving at the BCP. This may
point to a conclusion that the journey had
not been strictly facilitated, but was more
improvised in nature. Indeed, it is likely that
the sudden increase in the flow was trig-

Once in Germany, most migrants applied for
asylum once again, Eurodac hits confirming
earlier fingerprinting in Poland. In fact, only
2% of the roughly 12 000 applicants of Russian citizenship got a positive decision by
Germany in 2013. They were thus ordered to
return to Poland, their first place of applying
for asylum. However, many ignored this request and stayed in Germany, resulting in an
increase in detections of illegal stay of Russian citizens detected in Germany.

uments in 2012 to 156 in 2013. However, in
relation to the number of Russians crossing
the border and those abusing asylum procedures, the number of false document users
is relatively low.
b) Citizens of Georgia
The trends of refusals of entry and asylum requests by nationals of Georgia remained relatively stable compared with
2012. According to FRAN data, the number of refused Georgian nationals at all EU
external borders decreased from 8 846 in

40 of 50

2012 to 8 100 in 2013. This was mainly due
to fewer refusals issued at the Polish-Belarusian border. Despite the decrease in the
number of refusals of entry at the PolishBelarusian border, there were still far more
refusals of entry than regular entries by
Georgian nationals recorded at that border section in 2013.
Detections of illegal stay decreased too, falling to 3 973 persons detected in 2013 from
4 636 in 2012. The main Member States detecting Georgians on illegal stay were Germany and Sweden.

After reaching Belarus or Ukraine some travel
by train to BCPs where they are usually refused entry due to the lack of visa. After refusal they either apply for asylum or attempt
illegal border-crossing between BCPs mainly
from Belarus to Lithuania. Alternatively, some
travel straight from Minsk airport to the vicinity of Latvian or Lithuanian border in order to cross it illegally between BCPs.

In general, the main modus operandi of Georgian nationals attempting irregular entry to
the EU has remained unchanged in recent
years. The journey generally includes three
legs: (a) from Georgia to Belarus  /  Ukraine,
with no need of visa; (b) to the BCP or green
border; and (c) secondary movements inside
the area of free movement in the EU.

Figure 13. Correlation between indicators on refusals of entry in
Poland, asylum applications in Poland and Germany and detections
of illegal stay by Germany of Russian citizens further corroborate the
assumption of quick secondary movements from Poland to Germany

Ja

In contrast to developments at the EU borders, the number of Georgians refused entry
by Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine increased
by 51% from 414 in 2012 to 798 in 2013. The
highest increase was reported at the Ukrainian-Belarusian border. The reasons for this
increase may include changes in the Russian migration policy and  /  or migrants’ preference for different routing towards Ukraine.

There seems to be an increased risk of links
between irregular migration and Georgian
organised crime in the EU. This concern was
highlighted by the Belarusian authorities in
connection with the amnesty in Georgia,
where, according to the Belarusians, up to

© Border Service of Ukraine

According to EDF data there was an increase
in the number of Georgians detected using
false documents in 2013. In 2012 Member
States reported 118 persons using false documents, while in 2013 this number rose to
182. However, these detections seem not to
be connected with the phenomenon at the
land borders, because the detections were
made in other Member States. Passports were
the most often reported type of false document used.

17 000 prisoners were released at the beginning of 2013. Open sources in Member States
have also reported the growth of Georgian
crime groups. However, a clear link with irregular migration and its facilitation cannot
be established.

to prosecuting ’visa traders’. Member States’
consular authorities in Ukraine seek to counter visa fraud with strengthening the capacity
of their staff at consular sections and improving the technical equipment needed to detect false documents.

c)	Citizens of Belarus, Moldova and
Ukraine

Still, in 2013 Member States reported 7 788
refusals of entry at all external EU borders
to nationals of Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine
due to lack of appropriate documentation
justifying the purpose and conditions of stay,
indicating a continuing abuse of visas. Overstaying the length of the visa period is also
a common modus operandi to abuse visas. Of
almost 17 000 (decrease from 18 591 in 2012)
detected illegally staying Belarusians, Moldovans and Ukrainians, roughly 8 000 were detected on exit from the EU at external land,
sea and air borders during 2013. The main
locations of these detections remained the
Polish-Ukrainian and Hungarian-Ukrainian
border sections.

For EB-RAN country nationals the main modus operandi is to enter EU legally using visas
issued by neighbouring countries and move
to other Member States with the intention
to overstay. However, the trend of detections
was decreasing with Member States issuing 10% fewer refusals of entry to citizens of
Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine in 2013 at all
EU external borders (21 861) compared with
2012 (24 313). The share of common borders,
including borders with the Russian Federation, was roughly 20 000.
Ukrainian nationals were refused entry mostly
by Poland (77%) and Hungary (12%) reflecting the large volume of regular traffic. At the
Polish-Belarusian border, which was the hotspot for refusals issued to nationals of Russian Federation and Georgia, refusals issued
to nationals of Belarus remained at a much
lower level.
The issue of false supporting documentation
for visa applications continued to be a threat.
There are, for example, companies and individuals in Member States and Ukraine who, in
exchange for money, provide visa applicants
with necessary documents or even fictitious
invitation letters. As mentioned already in the
EB-ARA 2013 there is also a ‘market’ for supporting false documentation such as bank
statements, employment status certificates
or notary deeds in Ukraine.
It can be assessed that the majority of Member States are faced with such practices,
which are fuelled by many legal limitations

42 of 50

The use of false stamps is often linked with
attempts to hide overstaying. According
to EDF data, the number of detected false
stamps decreased to 498 in 2013 from 616
in 2012, mainly detected in Hungary, Poland
and Slovakia.
In 2013 only 279 illegal border-crossings between BCPs of nationals of these three countries were reported by Member States at
common borders including the borders with
the Russian Federation. Moreover, only 122
were linked to migration purposes (89 by
Moldovan nationals).
d) Other CIS-country nationals
Irregular migration of other CIS-country nationals such as Uzbeks and Tajiks tends to
affect regional borders rather than common borders with Member States. Here the
changes in migration regulations in the Russian Federation, which is the main destina-

tion country for migrants from Central Asian
CIS countries, play an important role.
The new limitation of stay for foreigners entering the Russian Federation without a visa
to no more than 90 days within a 180-day
period is aimed to prevent labour migrants
from indefinitely ‘renewing’ their legal 90day stay in the Russian Federation by simply
crossing the border and coming back. If this
rule of stay will be strictly enforced, it might
impact the situation especially at regional and,
to a lesser extent, common borders in 2014.
3.3.2. Mitigation
As the most prevalent modus operandi is to
abuse legal travel channels, mitigation include
a combination of issues and measures at all
tiers of the four-tier access control model, including visa issuance, cross-border cooperation, border controls and cooperation with
asylum process and police authorities within
the area of free movement.
Supporting consulates in visa issuance
In visa abuse cases the key mitigation measures are focused on the consulates issuing visas. They should be increasingly supported by
liaison officers of border-control authorities
experienced with detecting false documents
and fraudulent supporting documents. This
has proved to be a very cost effective method
to mitigate the risk.
Information exchange between the consulates and BCPs in second-line checks should
be also strengthened in order to create a similar situational picture.
Use of Visa Information System
The Visa Information System (VIS) is a system for the exchange of information on short-

stay visas between Member States. The VIS
facilitates the exchange of data between
Schengen states on visa applications in order to ease procedures, prevent ‘visa shopping’ and assist in the fight against fraud. The
roll-out will continue throughout 2014, but
definite dates have not yet been determined
by the Council.
Increasing capacity of the asylum system
In the case of sudden large flows of people
applying for asylum and then absconding, the
capacity of the asylum centres as well as fast
processing and evaluation of asylum applications is crucial. The same applies for double
applications in Member States.
Exploring possibilities of compensatory
controls at the internal borders
The implementation of compensatory controls at the internal borders of the EU is also
a factor in mitigating the risk of secondary
movements inside the EU area of free movement, especially in cases when there is a
well-established irregular flow between the
Member States. Cooperation with police authorities inside the area of free movements
should be stressed.
Use of entry  /  exit systems
In mitigating the risk of overstaying, the implementation of planned entry  /  exit systems
would increase the efficiency of border checks
to detect overstay.
Media  /  information campaigns in third
countries
Providing correct information about asylum
procedure to contain the spread of rumours
in third countries may discourage would-be
migrants’ to leave their countries of origin.

4. Outlook
4.1. Regular traffic
The long-term factors for growth of regular
cross-border traffic are still valid. However,
due to the economic slowdown in Ukraine
and the Russian Federation, deepened further by the Ukrainian crisis, the potential for
growth in 2014 is clearly weaker than in 2013
possibly leading to drop in the volume in regular traffic at some border sections.
However, the measures to increase the capacity of BCPs by improving infrastructure,
technology and border check process should
not be abandoned but on the contrary – further encouraged. This is especially important
in terms of (a) roll-out of the Visa Information
System when all Schengen Member States
will be required to be able to carry out fingerprint verifications at all BCPs and also to
issue VIS visas with biometric features at the
border when necessary; and (b) possible further visa liberalisations between the EU and
Eastern Partnership countries that would very
likely significantly increase traffic flows as
well as increase the responsibility of border
checks in validating the conditions of entry.

4.2. Cross-border crime
Cross-border crime will remain a major challenge affecting both green borders and BCPs.
Price differences and unemployment in the
border areas will continue to make locallevel smuggling of cigarettes and petrol an
attractive source of income. However, legislative changes have proved to be an effective way to curtail these activities.
Smuggling of illicit drugs across common borders is becoming increasingly varied in re-

44 of 50

gards of the variety of products, directions
and markets.

4.3. Irregular migration
The situation in important origin countries of
non-regional migrants, such as Afghanistan
and Syria, remains highly problematic, which
will very likely lead to continued large refugee flows. Another factor impacting both regional and non-regional migrants are changes
in migration policies and labour markets in
the Russian Federation, possibly triggered by
the economic downturn and western economic sanctions, which may also act as a
push factor for migrants to leave the Russian Federation.
However, the impacts on common borders
are much more difficult to assess as the geopolitical or economic developments have
rarely directly correlated with the irregular
migration flows in the region. Indeed, it is
likely that, for example, the number of Syrian migrants attempting illegal border-crossing will increase in 2014, yet the magnitude of
the threat will depend on several interlinked
factors, such as changes in the use of other
routes, prices of facilitation and the possibilities of entry to the CIS area. It is possible that
the abuse of legal entry as a modus operandi
may grow also among non-regional migrants.
The abuse of legal entries by migrants from
the EB-RAN region is likely to continue. Sudden flows such as those experienced in 2013
are impossible to predict, but the risk of rumours being spread of a low-risk option to
enter the EU remains valid. Changes of routes
may lead to quickly increasing pressure at
BCPs and on the asylum systems.

Considering the abuse of visas, increased
support by border authorities to consular
offices is needed especially before the rollout of the VIS and implementation of Smart
Borders package.

The impact of the Ukrainian crisis has
emerged as the main uncertainty in the outlook for 2014 and beyond. The impact on irregular migration still depends on the rapidly
evolving situation in Ukraine. So far the direct impact of the Ukrainian crisis on common
borders has been limited to a slight increase
in asylum applications by Ukrainian nationals.
At the time of writing this report four possible developments impacting both regular
and irregular migration flows could be identified: (a) further population movements from
Crimea and Eastern Ukraine; (b) movements
of third-country nationals out of Ukraine;
(c) changes in directions of labour migration
and (d) Russian passport issuance in Crimea
increasing the number of persons holding
two valid passports.
Population movements from Crimea are possible considering those persons who do not
want to opt for Russian citizenship and passports that the Russian Federation has started
to distribute. The main impact of these movements would most likely be limited to Ukraine,
i.e. movements to the western parts of the
country. Still, as sudden changes in the situation cannot be ruled out, for example, due
to hostilities in the Eastern Ukraine, the bordering Member States have updated their
contingency plans in case there would be
significant flows of refugees from Ukraine.
If the general instability in Ukraine continues for a longer period of time, it may also
increase the number of people intending to
leave Ukraine to work abroad. Among the

4.4. Ukrainian crisis

Figure 15. Ukrainian border guards keep performing tasks on the
entrance to the Crimean peninsula

first likely to leave are migrant communities present in Ukraine including, for example, Somalis. This might lead to an increase
in asylum requests in the EU and more illegal border-crossings.
As regards Ukrainian citizens, the continued
instability in the country could lead to an increased risk of visa abuses and overstaying.
Wider changes in directions of labour migration are also possible, for example, if visa-free
travel between Ukraine and the Russian Federation is suspended. Vulnerable labour migrants could take more risks in taking work
offers also from the irregular labour market.
The policy of the Russian Federation to
quickly issue passports in Crimea is likely to
lead to an increased number of persons with
two valid passports thus increasing the risk of
visa abuses. The integrity of the passport issuance process may not be taken for granted
either, which additionally increases the risk
of the use of Russian passports obtained under a false identity.
