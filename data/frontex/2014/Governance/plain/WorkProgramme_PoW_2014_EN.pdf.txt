Executive Summary
The Programme of Work is Frontex’ operative plan which contains the key business areas and proposes
the activities that should be carried out to achieve the objectives and long term goals as agreed in
Frontex’ Strategy and Multi Annual Plan.
During 2014, Frontex’ operational activities will be grouped under two approaches which are
applicable to all types of borders:
Platform based operational activities (to develop and intensify the use of multipurpose
operations at air, sea and land borders as a permanent platform for providing sustaining operational
presence and information exchange/gathering in areas exposed to specific and disproportionate
pressure; for reinforcement at external borders when needed and for strengthening interagency
cooperation and gaining border related intelligence) and
Flexible operational activities and return operations (to further develop and use flexible
cooperation frameworks enabling MS/SAC to increase situational awareness, response,
interoperability and performance to tackle identified threats and risks affecting the EU external
border, thus substantially contributing to the situational awareness according to the EUROSUR
objectives);
Geographically and/or topical the focus of those operational activities will remain on





Eastern, South Eastern and Western Balkan areas
Easter Europe, and
Identified Eastern, Central, Western Mediterranean Regions migratory routes and Atlantic
Ocean
Further developing cooperation with non-EU Countries and with EU Agencies and International
Organisations (Europol, FRA, Interpol, UNHCR, IOM);

Compared to previous years the following issues will drive further changes to the structure and
allocation of resources reflected in the annual programme of work:
 the further development, implementation and operationalisation of the EUROSUR framework
concept;
 the operational support to Greece and Italy aimed at building sustainable capacity for border
management, giving added value at the EU level,
 the utilization of new structures (e.g. European Border Guard Teams - EBGT) and types of
officers (Seconded Guest Officer - SGO and Frontex’ coordination officer - FCO) including
training;
 further and refined implementation measures related to Frontex’ amended mandate;
In 2014, Frontex will continue to be in a situation where prioritisation is needed. Financing of
prioritised tasks will lead to a slow down and postponement of other implementation measures of
lower priority.

On the revenue side, Frontex’ budget for 2014 will decrease by 4.8 M EUR (compared to 2013).
Experiences of the past years, confirmed by ongoing activities have shown that the lack of a budgetary
- operational reserve poses the risk of cancellation of Frontex’ coordinated activities onto the
Page 5 of 135

Member States and Frontex. To mitigate this risk internal measures (Operational Contingency) have
been taken to ensure the short term redistribution of financial and human resources to unplanned
operational activities due to emerging situations.

2014 will see a net decrease of staff by one staff member. In line with the recent version of the MSPP
2014 - 2017-the Programme of Work 2014 shows in total 317 staff members (152 TA, 87 CA and 78
SNEs). The findal istribution between TA and AST is not known yet
Deficits, due to the cut of staff, will be compensated by utilizing synergies from new systems (e.g.
EUROSUR, EBGT, Seconded Guest Officers, and FCO) and reallocation of resources to new functions
and responsibilities.

The conventionally calculated ratio between administrative and operational expenditure will be at the
level of 38 to 62%. Direct operational expenditures will amount to 62 % of the budget in 2014; which
(overall) will be a decrease by 7.3 M € compared to the budget for 2013 (N1). It is worth to mention
that during 2014 a number of long term investments will materialise related to the upcoming move of
the Agency to a new premises in 2015. Corresponding savings will show not earlier than in 2015.

Following Frontex’ Strategy, the largest part of Frontex’ budget is allocated to Joint Operations. This
to further improve the capabilities of Member States to tackle demanding situations and also to
enhance Frontex’ capabilities and effectiveness in coordinating the operational activities of the
Member States and Schengen Associated Countries. Risk analysis will enable better focusing on the
main routes of irregular migration and the enhancement of the impact of border management on
fighting crime at the external borders.
During the 39th meeting of Frontex’ Management Board (MB) the mandate for the Frontex Operational
Office (FOO) pilot was extended until the end of 2013. The MB decided to rename the FOO to Frontex
Liaison Office (LO) with slightly downscaled tasks. The Goal ‘Organisation’ contains a placeholder for
the FOO considering the current allocation of human resources.
An amount of 9.1 M EUR (-0.2 M EUR) will be allocated to Joint Operations and Pilot Projects at Land
Borders to tackle irregular migration flows and to enhance the impact on crime fighting at the EU’s
external borders by targeting the Eastern Mediterranean and Balkan routes as well as Eastern routes
where appropriate.
With an allocated amount of 21.4 M EUR (6.5 M EUR) Joint Operations and Pilot Projects at Sea
Borders will be, as in earlier years, the recipients of the biggest share of Frontex budget allocations.
Strengthening the Member States’ operational capacity to cover increased operational areas and
implementation periods will enhance the tackling of irregular migration flows on routes identified by
risk analysis.
Air Borders will have a budget of 2.1 M EUR (-0.2 M EUR) for the further implementation of a flexible
approach to fluctuations in the phenomena of irregular migration and crime fighting mainly by utilising
Focal Points at various airports to be identified by risk analysis.
Return Operations will intensify their capacity building activities and maintain their support for
Member States and SACs organising joint return operations. A slightly increased budget of 9.5 M €
(+0.7 M EUR) will be made available.
Within the Operations Division the risks related to the absence of a budgetary reserve will be mitigated
by ‘earmarking’ a certain percentage of the financial means allocated to units and sectors of the
division (arg: centralised operational reserve). This amount can be used to cover activities in case of
a reprioritisation due to changes to the migration situation/risks. Consequently, those amounts (which
will remain assigned to certain objectives) will follow an enhanced approval process prior to the
issuance of a financial commitment.
Risk Analysis will provide strategic analytical products and related advice as well as operational and
tactical analytical products to internal and external stakeholders in a timely manner. A budget of 1.4
M € (+0.0 M EUR) will be made available to improve the quality of these products and services, to
produce several periodical and ad hoc risk assessments, and to provide analytical support to
operational activities of the Agency.
Frontex Situation Centre (FSC) will maintain situational awareness, support risk analysis and assist
emergency/crisis management processes through further increased operability provided by a 9/7
service (0.8 M EUR);
To fully operationalise Eurosur an overall amount of 4.0 M EUR will be allocated. This amount is split
over three areas, namely Information Management (2.0 M EUR) and Information Technology (1.7 M
EUR), 0.2 M EUR are foreseen for the Eurosur Expert Group.

Page 8 of 135

In 2014 Research & Development activities will have a budget of 1.0 M EUR to drive the process of the
harmonisation of border control and the development of standards - both operational and technical.
Furthermore it is foreseen to undertake activities to inform the Member States about new
technical/technological developments in the field of border control (preferably by way of organizing
practical demonstrations) and to represent the common interests of the Member States in border
security research.
During 2014, the emphasis of Training activities will be on the development and provision of common
standards for general trainings (e.g. CCC, CML, EBGT) with a reduction of specialized training per se. A
budget of 4.05 M € (-0.7 M EUR) will be made available for different activities. In addition, Frontex
will actively contribute to the European Law Enforcement Training Scheme (LETS) in close cooperation
with CEPOL.
With a budget of 1.0 M EUR Pooled Resources will manage and further develop the European Border
Guard Teams and Technical Equipment Pools. By increasing the availability and deployability of
operational resources for joint operations, technical and operational assistance, and rapid operational
assistance, Frontex’ response capacity will be strengthened.

Supporting Operational Activities

TOTAL OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES

Monitoring performance together with the further implementation of measures in line with Internal
Control Standards, should guarantee governance and management of Frontex towards its strategic
goals as agreed in Frontex’ Strategy and Multi Annual Plan 2014.
For this purpose the following five key performance indicators have been established:
1. Participation Index - In 2014 the number of Member States participating in operational activities
should remain at the same level as in 2013 (average 25 MSs participating in operational activities).
2. Usage of Pools - 90% of the guest officers deployed in Frontex coordinated activities should come
from the EBGT pool
Page 9 of 135

3. Product Delivery Ratio – The timely delivery of Frontex’ products and services will be maintained
at the 2013 level (100%). To achieve that, the level of timely delivery of external contributions must
be stabilised at the level of 85%.
4. Customer Satisfaction - The increased focus on the quality of Frontex’ products and services should
result in an improved level of customer satisfaction (increase by 0.2 points to 4.0).
5. Resource Ratio - The contributions from participating Member States to operational activities,
compared to the contributions from hosting Member States, will be enhanced to 40% (HR) and 60%
(TE). As the figures vary significantly between the different types of borders, the focus will be on sea
borders.

The first (general) part of the document starts with an Introduction and the Environmental Scanning
which briefly touches on external factors of Frontex’ societal and task environment. It continues with
an outline of Frontex’ Mission, Vision and Values and elaborates briefly on methodological aspects
considered during the drafting and elaboration of the document. The chapter continues with an
elaboration on Operational Risks encountered and Mitigation measures proposed which are
summarised in the Risk Matrix. The first part finalises with a more detailed elaboration on corporate
and governance issues such as corporate risks and mitigation, governance of performance,
prioritisation and financial and human resources needed to implement the suggested activities.
As indicated by the heading, this chapter is required to be read regardless of the perspective the
reader would prefer to take for the rest of the document.
The second part of the document (Strategic Goals and Key Objectives for 2014) Frontex’ Key
Business Areas) links the Programme of Work with Frontex’ Strategy and Multi Annual Plan. In this part
all activities for 2014 are grouped and elaborated in two ways:



Firstly, by business area and
Secondly by goal/key objective and priority criteria.

Critical, cross cutting issues (Eurosur, own equipment and EBGT) are mentioned separately. Before
turning toward the different business areas a brief overview on budget allocations and a comparison
between conventional (Titles) and activity based budgeting is made.
The next chapter shows how financial resources are allocated to the different key business (functional)
areas of Frontex.
The closing chapter repeats the exercise of allocation of resources but takes an activity based
approach. Regarding resourcing, this part mainly focuses on human resources, whereas the previous
chapter focused on financial resources. For each of the key objective, outcomes are defined that
should be achieved by the activities mentioned. The achievement of the outcome can be measures by
indicators assigned to each of the objectives.
The third part consists of a number of annexes (Annex 1 – Annex 4).
Annex 1 provides an organisational chart also including the number of human resources assigned to
certain functions;
Annex 2 will provide an overview of procurement procedures to be carried out during 2014.

Page 10 of 135

Annex 3 elaborates on the Training Plan – Training Portfolio for 2014;
Annex 4 (RESTREINT UE) outlines the Plan of Operations for 2014.
Annex 4 will be used by the Schengen Associated Countries to execute their voting rights which is
limited to activities with their involvement or impacting on them.
Annex 4 has been classified as ‘RESTREINT UE’ due to its sensitive content, the disclosure of which
would jeopardise and seriously harm the success of MS driven and supported operational activities
coordinated by Frontex.

1. General Part
1.1. Introduction
The first (general) part links Frontex’ Strategy and the concrete activities (presented in the second
part). It depicts the environment and shows the allocation of human and financial resources. It also
explains the criteria for prioritisation of activities. An important element of the general part is to
illustrate what measures will be taken to mitigate risks and to achieve the objectives in the light of
key performance indicators.
The second part contains a prioritised list of activities, broken down by business areas of the agency.
This serves the purpose of Activity Based Management (ABM) and Activity Based Budgeting (ABB) as
each activity is presented with a description of expected outcome and with the allocation of both,
human and financial resources. At the current stage some of the figures ‘double count’ human
resources which will be corrected in the final version.
A more detailed plan of operations and training activities are presented in separate annexes (under
preparation). The plan of operations is a restricted annex of the Programme of Work.

1.2. Environmental Scanning
Frontex acts in an unstable environment, impacted upon by political, economical, social,
technological, legal and environmental factors.
This section outlines the factors that might directly or indirectly have an impact on the
implementation of the proposed Programme of Work.
Environmental scanning is an ongoing process that could lead to changes to Frontex’ activities. More
detailed findings are contained in analytical products such as the Annual and Semi-annual Risk
Assessments, but also in quarterly reports such as the FRAN quarterlies and Tailored Risk Assessments.

1.3. Mission, Vision and Values
Mission
Frontex supports, coordinates and develops European border management in line with the Charter of
Fundamental Rights of the EU.
Frontex supports the Member States1 (MS) to achieve an efficient, high and uniform level of border
control.
Frontex coordinates operational and EU measures to jointly respond to exceptional situations at the
external borders.
Frontex develops capacities at the Member State and European level as combined instruments to
tackle challenges of migration flows, and the fight against serious organised crime and terrorism at the
external borders
Frontex is the trustworthy European Border Agency, strengthening the European area of Freedom,
Security and Justice by supporting the Member States to keep up with their responsibilities.

Vision
Frontex applies the concept of Integrated Border Management and promotes a European border culture
based on the full respect of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU.
Professional staff and a set of operational and administrative capabilities enable Frontex to add value
to the European Union.

Values

1.4. Methodology
The Programme of Work is prepared through the corporate planning cycle, respecting the deadlines of
Frontex regulation. Certain activities of Frontex contribute to the EU Policy Cycle, focusing on the
priorities of the EU Internal Security Strategy.
In line with the corporate planning cycle, Frontex’ programme of work develops iteratively. This allows
increasing the level of detail constantly, and adapting the document as assessments of operational risk
levels change during the current year. Consequently, also the basic elements of the plan of operations
and training activities are to be further developed during the Corporate Planning Meeting (mid June)
and further detailed and agreed upon during the Annual Bilateral Talks (beginning October).
The same goes for the organisational structure of Frontex. Based on the outcome of the evaluation of
Frontex’ Operational Office done by the Management Board during 2013 the plan to implement the
recommendations made will be refined in executing the programme of work 2014.
Frontex applies a Goal and Priority oriented approach. The six Goals of Frontex (Situational
Awareness, Supporting Response, Emergency Response, Development, Organisation and Staff) give
strategic direction to the agency. There is no prioritisation between the goals. Instead, the key
objectives of each Goal (as described in Frontex Strategy and the Multi-Annual Plan) and the activities
in this Programme of Work are prioritised.

Risk and Activity Based Management
Frontex strives to improve its performance by implementing quality and risk management measures
and managerial measures shown by the achievement of key performance indicators at all
organisational levels.
Risk management is a continuous process applied by the senior management to mitigate the corporate
risks (see more in chapter 1.6).
Frontex will gradually apply Activity Based Management (ABM) and Activity Based Budgeting (ABB), in
line with the recommendation of the joint statement of the European Commission, Council and the
European Parliament of July 2012.

1.5. Operational Risk and Risk Mitigation
Outlook of the situation at the external borders in 2014 – Targeted operational
risk analysis
Based on Frontex Annual Risk Analysis and in particular the descriptions of the situation in 2012 and a
review of the main factors, be it economic, legal or technical, that can contribute one way or another
to irregular migration to the EU, this outlook reviews the possible evolution of the situation along the
external border of the EU.

Page 14 of 135

Since the Frontex Annual Risk Analysis was released in March, Croatia has joined the EU and its land,
air and sea borders now form part of the external borders of the EU. In terms of irregular migration to
the EU, Croatia is more a transit country than a destination country for irregular migrants. As part of
the Western Balkans, irregular migration in Croatia is mostly shaped by secondary movements of
migrants who crossed illegally the border with Turkey. Thus, the fact that Croatia is not yet joining the
Schengen area and that border control will continue to operate between Croatia and other Member
States, is expected to have moderate impact on the main routes used by irregular migrants. Most
irregular migrants are expected to use the main road connection between Greece and the Schengen
area, which runs through the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and then Serbia towards Hungary.
Other developments are likely to materialise, others seem possible, based on current knowledge.
Finally, past experiences demonstrate that there are a large number of unforeseeable events and
factors that can have a profound and unpredictable impact on the situation at the border.

1.5.1. The likely
The best forecasts – those likely to materialise and have a direct bearing on the situation at the
external borders – are the continued use of the Mediterranean area as the main crossing points for
irregular migration, and the growth of passengers flows.

Illegal border-crossing expected to remain concentrated in southern and south-eastern
borders of the EU
Based on the location of the main countries of origin for irregular migration to the EU for the past five
years, the border areas that are most likely to deal with illegal border-crossing remain the Southern
Mediterranean coast, and the borders with Turkey. Migrants living in or having relatively
easy/facilitated access to Turkey and/or North Africa will continue to be overrepresented in the flow
of irregular migrants to the EU.
The internet and social networking sites will contribute to the rapid exploitation of vulnerabilities
along the external border of the EU, allowing relatively cheap and non-sophisticated illegal bordercrossing. It is expected that illegal border-crossing along either the land border or the sea border, will
continue to significantly mobilise border-control authorities in the EU. An increasing number of
migrants from Northern Africa and the Middle East are expected to transit to Turkey via the air border,
before attempting to cross illegally the border to the EU, including through the use of forged
document.
Istanbul airport is an important hub for irregular migrants travelling by air route to several Member
States, with continuous increase in passengers’ flows for the past several years and expanding strategy
towards Africa and the Middle East. Turkish airports are thus likely to remain common embarking
points for irregular migrants arriving in the EU.

Page 15 of 135

Increase passenger flows
In particular at the air border, regular passenger flows across the external border will increase
significantly in the coming years due to rising global mobility, visa liberalisation processes and local
border traffic agreements along the eastern borders.
Consistent with the increasing flow of passengers, a registered traveller programme should further
ensure the smooth flow of bona fide passengers.
Indeed, while movements across the external air borders are managed through a layered approach,
where the border is divided into four components (in departure countries, at embarking airports, at
the border and after border crossing), the physical border is increasingly becoming a secondary layer
for risk assessment, meaning that checking and screening begins well before air passengers cross
border control posts at airports. Border management will increasingly be risk-based, to ensure that
interventions are focused on high-risk movements of people, while low-risk movements are facilitated
smoothly.
An important strategy for efficiently processing increasing passengers flow is the development and
deployment of Automated Border Control Systems. Such systems are being installed progressively in
several Member States’ airports.
Automated Border Control Systems use the electronic information in the passport like facial
recognition technology to perform checks normally undertaken manually at the BCP.
Air travel environment is becoming more complex with the growth of low-cost carriers. In addition,
advances in travel complexity and increasing sophistication of criminal activities result in increasing
workload for border control officers and increasing difficulties in developing plans and passengers risk
assessments.

1.5.2. The possible

Increase in mixed migratory flows: Asylum seekers and irregular migrants
The EU continues to receive a high number of applicants for international protection. On the other
hand, a substantial number of economic migrants appear to use the asylum procedure to try entering
or staying on the territory of the EU. The mixed nature of migratory flows contributes to placing the
national asylum systems under pressure and the credibility of the asylum procedures under strain.
Therefore, while Member States are continuing their asylum system reforms, they increasingly call for
the development at EU level of migration and refugee solutions in the regions of origin and transit.
In terms of asylum applications, Afghans are likely to continue to rank first for asylum applications,
with increase of Syrian nationals crossing the border illegally, mostly to seek refuge in Member States
of Central EU.
The situation in Afghanistan will remain volatile for some time to come. In addition, the large Afghan
communities in Iran and Pakistan will be increasingly faced with a worsening security situation and
governmental pressure to leave. This will probably inflate further the number of would-be migrants
trying to reach the EU.

Page 16 of 135

At the same time, Afghans are also ranking among the firsts in terms of detections for illegal stay
within the EU. Many among those detected are travelling within the EU, joining communities of
Afghans already established in the EU. When not granted asylum and not returned, many stay in the EU
illegally, hoping to find economic opportunities.
In Syria, it seems inevitable that more refugees will flee to Jordan and Lebanon. These flows will
increase social tensions both in refugee camps and also within the respective communities. Any postcivil war transition of power in Syria would be prolonged by ethnical, political and ideological
differences, hence insecurity will reign. Such circumstances, including the lack of habitable homes,
will make it difficult for Syrian refugees to return.

Continued involvement of organised crime groups (OCGs)
Smuggling of migrants and trafficking in human beings are reasons for the involvement of OCGs and it
is possible that OCGs will get further involved in facilitation of smuggling of migrants and trafficking in
human beings across the EU. There are growing reports that facilitators not only provide assistance to
cross the border illegally, but also to facilitate the stay of irregular migrants in Member States by
providing fraudulent documents.
However, there remain large uncertainties as to the level of organisation that can range from very
structured enterprises to opportunistic groups. Little is also known about the extent of the connection
between smuggling of migrants and trafficking in human beings. While by definition irregular migration
is linked to international movements, there remain many unknowns as to the international dimension
of the OCGs involved in these activities.
Some information point to the fact that leader of the OCGs are most often of the nationality of the
smuggled persons, while other indicate the involvement of many opportunistic groups no necessarily
specialising in the smuggling of migrants from a single nationality.

Document fraud
Given the increasing level of security features in modern travel documents and stricter migration
policies across Member States, the misuse of genuine travel documents is likely to be an entry method
which will steadily rise.
The look-alike method is likely to be increasingly used for illegal entry. Bulgarian and Romanian travel
documents are likely to be misused to a greater extent, given the existence of well developed
facilitation networks originating in both Member States.
However, the abuse of EU passports is of particular concern because migrants using them may be
subject to less rigorous checks at the external border. Another major issue relates to fraudulently
obtained visas, which raise particular challenges for first-line officers to detect, especially given
linguistic differences and fact that migrants are often not required to cross the external border of the
same Member State that issued the visa.
Some of these issues will be addressed by the Visa Information System (VIS) which should be
operational among issuing authorities across eleven regions by November 2013. However, its staggered
roll-out between and within Member States means that the analysis of detections of visa fraud is still
fragmented and does not provide for an overall comprehensive overview of the situation.

1.5.3. The unknown

Change in irregular migration routes following Romania and Bulgaria joining the Schengen
area
It is foreseeable that, following Bulgaria and Romania accessing to the Schengen area, this will
increase the pull factors for irregular migration through these Member States. However, to date, this
can only be an assumption that needs to be closely monitored. This change in the Schengen area and in
the external borders, may redistribute the flow of irregular migration, with potential effects on
irregular migration in the Mediterranean area.
Upon Bulgaria and Romania joining the Schengen area, the Schengen land border with Turkey will be
extended by 240 km, with BCP Kapitan Andreevo becoming one of the busiest BCP in the Schengen
area. This change will also break the isolation of Greece as a Schengen exclave, and provides overland
connections between Turkey and Western Schengen Members. Nevertheless, the fastest road corridor
between Istanbul and Western Europe will continue to go through the highway running through
Bulgaria, Serbia and Hungary, or Serbia and Croatia.
At the same time, the Black Sea will provide an added sea-link between Turkey and the Schengen area.
The possibility for facilitators to use small boats for irregular migration through the Black Sea exists.
This is due on the one hand to the length of the sea shore – 4 340 km, of which 3 815 km are in four
third countries (Georgia 310 km, the Russian Federation 475 km, Turkey 1 400 km, and Ukraine 1 628
km), while only a narrow stretch of 525 km is situated in the EU (Bulgaria 300 km, Romania 225 km) –
that offers many possibilities for departing sites of small boats. While this is less than the length of the
Mediterranean coastline (25 000 km, excluding island coastline), it still represents a challenge for
monitoring.
At the air border, Bulgaria and Romania joining the Schengen are expected to have limited impact on
passenger flow from outside the EU given the current relatively low number of extra-EU connections.
In conclusion, Bulgaria and Romania’s joining the Schengen area may trigger an increased pressure
towards these Member States. However it is more likely that facilitators will prefer to attempt illegal
border-crossing along the land border between Bulgaria and Turkey rather than through the Black Sea.

Time and composition of irregular migration flows
Illegal-migration flows are expected to follow known routes from North Africa and the Middle East to
the EU, mostly by sea and through the south-eastern land border via Turkey. The main uncertainties
concern the timing, as well as the size and composition of the flows. The composition and/or the size
of the flow will vary in response to the developing situation in North Africa and in the Middle East,
particularly in Syria and neighbouring countries.
Swift diversification of modi operandi, possible displacement between routes or border types, and
escalating attempts to evade detection or identification are all likely to occur in response to enhanced
surveillance. On the Eastern Mediterranean route, enhanced surveillance along the Greek land border
with Turkey has resulted in small displacement on neighbouring border sections.
Page 18 of 135

However it still unknown whether migrants stranded in Turkey will return home, or attempt alternative
entries to the EU. Several alternatives routes have been identified, like illegal border-crossing through
the Aegean Sea, through the land border between Bulgaria and Turkey or through direct connection
from Turkey to other Member States, by sea or air. However, at this stage none of these alternative
routes have yet emerged as replacing the levels of illegal border-crossing reported before August 2012.
On the Central Mediterranean, many areas on the Northern African coasts may be used as departure
points for illegal border-crossing to the EU. In the summer of 2013, departures from Libya and Egypt
were increasing, but Tunisia also offer short crossing options for potential migrants. Northern African
countries may be used as transit countries for migrants from more southern African countries to sail
across the Mediterranean. They may be used as transit by migrants from many different origins, which
complicate further predictions in terms of volume.
On the Western Mediterranean, similar situation prevails with departing points from Morocco and
Algeria. These northern African countries may be used in particular by Western African migrants
because they offer the shortest transit route, but also some economic opportunities for migrants
stranded there sometimes for long periods. In this environment, crises situations may quickly arise.

Sudden political and economic changes
Political evolutions are hard to predict. There is no assurance that another sharp economic downturn
or social unrest in neighbouring countries would not spur irregular migration. Though economic and
social duress had long be present in Northern Africa, the rapidity and expand of the changes brought
about by the Arab spring that began in December 2010 were largely unexpected.
Similarly, another sharp economic downturn in the EU, or, on the contrary, a strong rebound in
economic growth and demand for labour in the EU, may not be excluded and may have considerable
influence on irregular migration to the EU.

Migrants staying illegally in the EU
There is an intelligence gap on the profile of persons staying illegally in Member States, which prevents
border-control authorities from effectively assessing entry criteria, in particular the assessment for
lacking appropriate justification for the purpose of stay. Indeed, the indicators on detections of
persons staying illegally are strongly influenced by the national resources devoted to their detections.
As past experience of regularisation programmes have shown, the total number of detections may
under-represent some categories of migrants staying illegally but rather inconspicuous, like for
example Ukrainians employed as domestic workers or providing care to the elderly.

Particular priorities of Frontex in 2014 are the implementation of the European Surveillance System
(EUROSUR) and the further development of the European Border Guard Teams (EBGT) including the
Technical Equipment Pool (TEP).
As regards, EUROSUR, Frontex will provide the European Situational Picture (ESP) and the Pre-Frontier
Intelligence Picture (CPIP). In addition, Frontex will apply the system of the Common Surveillance Tools
and specifically developed analytical tools. The assessment of impact levels, assigned to different
border sections and related response capabilities, will aim at more real-time response of Frontex
operational activities.
The corporate planning meeting shall enable the finalisation of the prioritisation of activities by cross
checking them with national priorities and updated preferences for specific projects, products and
services.

1.7. Financial and Human Resources
Frontex is an agency “on cruising speed” in 2014. This means in practices a reduction of staff by 1%, as
required by the budgetary authorities.
As regards the financial resources, both the contribution to EUROSUR and the removal to new premises
will burden the administrative expenditure in 2014, but will gain savings during the following years.

In Frontex Strategy, under each Goal the Key Objectives are grouped as ‘Prioritised’ and ‘Others’. The
Multi Annual Plan elaborates for each prioritised Key Objectives the Activities to be carried out from
2014 – 2017.
In the Programme of Work all activities for 2014 are grouped and elaborated
by business area (chapter 2.2.) and
by priority criteria (chapter 2.3.).

Particularly under chapter 2.3. the activities will be briefly described also showing the outcome
expected, the resources (human and financial) needed to carry out the activities and the indicators used
to measure achievement. Additionally, a reference to the Goal/Objective is made.

In 2014 the most important development tasks of the agency are related to:
 the implementation and further development of EUROSUR
 the further development of the European Border Guard Teams (EBGT) including Frontex’
Technical Equipment Pool (TEP) – forming an element of Frontex’ reaction capacity

Page 30 of 135

Eurosur
The Eurosur Regulation entered into force on 2 December 2013. In 2014 the importance of Eurosur as a
framework for Frontex activities will continue to increase. The services provided by Frontex (in
particular the European Situational Picture as well as the Common Pre-Frontier Intelligence Picture by
using the Common Surveillance Tools and specifically developed analytical tools) will be further
developed and enhanced. The assessment of impact levels assigned to the different border sections, and
the related reaction capabilities will enhance the real-time dimension of Frontex’ operational response.
Contributions to Eurosur are split in two types (direct and indirect). The overall allocations to Eurosur
will be 9.9 ME; direct contributions will come from RAU and FSC, indirect ones from EPN and Poseidon.

Developing an additional operational response capacity
Own equipment
Both the use of Common Surveillance Tools for improved situational awareness, and the enhanced
operational response capacity following the impact level assessment, underlines the importance for
Frontex to exploit the possibility of using its own technical equipment to quickly respond to changing
demands. Based on pilot activities in 2013, Frontex will take measures to establish its own (contracted
from MSs or other suppliers) technical means on a limited scale. It is worth noting that this will not have
an impact on the scale of the overall budget.
Seconded Guest Officers
As another element, the enhanced utilization of Seconded Guest Officers will strengthen Frontex’
response capacity.

European Border Guard Team
Increased efforts will be taken (awareness, training and implementation of IT enabled solution) made to
guarantee the officers deployed in Frontex’ coordinated operational activities are member of the
European Border Guard Team. Also, for ensuring that the members of the European Border Guard Team
are properly trained and prepared for their deployment Frontex develops and implements a new form of
induction training to be carried out in direct connection to the deployment. Further to this, the Agency
develops and organises specialised training – including fundamental rights - for the different profiles.

With 42.1 M EUR the largest part of Frontex
budget is allocated to Joint Operations to
further strengthen the Member States
capabilities.
This will require better focusing on the main
routes of irregular migration to enhance the
impact of border management on fighting
serious crime at the external borders.
Regarding the distribution of financial means
between different types of borders, in 2014
the major part (21.4 M EUR) will be allocated
to sea border operations, followed by joint
return operations with 9.5 M EUR, land border
operations (9.1 M EUR) and air border
operations (2.1 M EUR).
Information Management (RAU and FSC) sums
up to 2.3 M EUR. In both figures direct and
indirect contributions to Eurosur are included.

accounts for 4.05 M EUR. Research and
Development Unit for 1.0 M EUR and the
Pooled Resources Unit for 1.0 M EUR.
Besides indirect financing of Eurosur related
activities (which are covered by the budgets
allocated to the units) an amount of 3.9 M
EUR will directly be allocated to Eurosur.

Conventional and Activity Based Budgeting (ABB)
The ratio between operational and administrative expenditures will be at the level of 55.3 M EUR (62%)
and 33.9 ME (38%). Compared to 2013 this would mean a decrease of operational expenditures by 5%.
Justification is given in Chapter 1.7.
According to an activity based distributions of the budget the ratio between operational related (fixed
and variable) and administrative (fixed and variable) expenditures would be 82% (73.4 ME) to 18% (15.8
ME). This gives a much better picture of the real distribution of financial means.

The figure reflects the budget allocation directly assigned to EUROSUR, in order to avoid double counting, Eurosur related
allocations remained in the budgets of the units and are shown in chapter 2.2

Miscellaneous operational activities
ED4BG

The Annual Risk Analyses (ARA, WB-ARA, EB-ARA, AFICAR, EDF-ARA) will continue to provide the information
and analytical basis for strategic and operational
programming. In addition to these, the new Risk
Analysis tactical update issued at the beginning of
September will inform the bilateral talks and the final
stages of PoW definition.

1 360 000

The main Frontex Risk Analysis Networks will continue
to be the foundation of strategic and operational
analytical activities, providing for regular information
exchange among the participants and to Frontex; the
specialist network on European Union Document Fraud
(EDF) will continue, also actions aiming at enhancing
the information exchange on cross-border crime,
including Trafficking in Human Beings. In addition,
Pulsar data collection will gradually develop into a
structured operational analysis network.
The Third Country Monitoring activity continues
feeding into various regular reports, ad hoc products,
and increasingly in the EUROSUR analysis layer. The
dissemination of the various tailored and regular
awareness products continues. The operational
analysis and evaluation will be implemented through:
 Structured intelligence collection;
 Development of data collection in JORA and
monitoring data quality, including Personal Data
Processing (PDP);
 Provision of analytical products, including initial

depersonalised operational analysis based on PDP,
and initial transmission of case-packages to other
LEA;
 Continue providing ad hoc situational awareness
advice on new trends and crisis situations in
operational areas in response to requests from
Commission and other high level stakeholders.
The implementation of the training component in risk
analysis specialised subjects will continue (FRONBAC),
covering training for Member States and third
countries, as well as the implementation of IT
development projects.
Reprioritisation
This concerns largely third country risk analysis
products and services as the workload on EU bordersrelated risk analysis products and services is growing.
It affects the activities listed below:
- Slower development in the implementation of
Article 4 of Frontex Regulation (assessment of
the capacity of Member States)
- Slower development in the implementation of
Art. 11 of the Frontex regulation (processing of
personal data)
- Cancellation of conferences targeting the
dissemination of regional risk analysis results
to senior officials. (Eastern Borders, Western
Balkans, and Turkey Risk Analysis Networks, as
well as AFIC)
- Reduction in the frequency of the current
North Africa and the Near East (NANE) Weekly
Report to a Bi-Weekly Report
- Reduction in the current level of the third
country monitoring activity, resulting in
reduced third country input for regular
products and availability of response to ad hoc
requests
- Focusing resources on maintaining the support
to the post visa liberalisation in the Western
Balkans (not allowing supporting any other
policy process of this nature.)
- Cancellation of the previous plans to deploy
risk analysis support to inform regional
consular networks.
- Lower intensity for the rollout of Common
Integrated Risk Analysis Model
Financial Reprioritisation
Contributions for the development of analysis tools
that had been planned under the budget of RAU will
not take place. The Analysis Tools to be developed will
be based on ICT budget with the support of RAU as a
business unit, which allows for re-allocation of 120,000

ANNEX 3 - TRAINING PLAN – TRAINING PORTFOLIO 2014
The Frontex objectives in the field of Training for 2014 are mainly to:






Develop and implement common core curricula focusing on harmonising learning standards for
mid-level and high-level border guard training and development of common modular study
programmes as a basis for exchange of border guard students in both academic and vocational
training frameworks;
Promote the development and the implementation of the European Law Enforcement Training
Scheme;
Provide advanced training to the members of the European Border Guard Teams (EBGT)12 pool;
Further development of training products with emphasis on common standards and use of
modern educational methods such as e Learning.

Frontex courses and training activities are implemented on the basis of the course programmes and
curricula designed through a joint effort of Frontex and experts from Member States/Schengen
Associated Countries (MS/SAC).
Multiplier training, where Frontex trains multipliers who then carry out national training activities in
their respective home countries, is often used as the most efficient way to cascade knowledge and
skills to all MS/SAC. Standardised results in all MS/SAC are ensured through the use of Frontex training
tools (CD, DVD multimedia tools) and through guidelines given to multiplier trainers. With this
approach to translate the training products and to qualify the national multipliers, all Border Guard
officers can be trained to the same training standards in their mother tongue.
Below follows a presentation of activities and products divided into:

1. Common Core Curricula for the Education and Training of Border Guards
2. Training for Members of the European Border Guard Teams (EBGT)
3. Common Training Standards and Training for Instructors
4. Training Support Networks and New Solutions for Education and Training

1. Common Core Curricula for the Education and Training of Border Guards
This programme will contribute to harmonizing the education and training of European Border Guards
within all stages of their careers on a competence driven, learning outcomes based approach,
integrating fundamental rights in training design as underpinning principles, and promoting the
implementation of Bologna and Copenhagen standards to Border Guard training.

The Common Core Curriculum for EU Border Guard Basic Training (CCC)
The CCC is a curriculum offering measurable common standards for national BG training institutions,
teachers and students in all EU Member States. It consists of a general part and modules for sea, air
and land borders. It is the first common curriculum including common skills and competencies (as
common standards) for basic training of law enforcement officers in the EU. The CCC has been updated
by joint efforts of Member States under Frontex’ lead.
In 2014 the CCC work includes:
-

Continued support and assistance to MS/SAC for the implementation of the
updated CCC;

-

CCC implementation in Frontex Partner Countries - second phase;

-

Interoperability Assessment Programme; Teachers’ mobility/exchange
programme enhancing the role of the Frontex Partnership Academies;

-

Erasmus-like student exchange programme

Work on common standards for Mid-level and High-level BG training is aiming at further developing and
harmonising the educational standards and learning requirements for mid-level and high-level border
guard education, on the basis of the Sectoral Qualifications Framework for Border Guarding according
to Bologna/Copenhagen principles and the European Qualifications Framework for Lifelong Learning
(EQF). It includes:

Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS) for EU Mid-level Border Guards
CCLS is aiming to harmonise the learning requirements for mid-level BG officers according to
Bologna/Copenhagen principles. The final product is intended as a modular programme structure
comprising a core set of learning standards for mid-level border guard education that will serve as a
curriculum guideline and/or as a degree structure for an EQF / SQF level 6 programme. The CCLS for
EU Mid-level Border Guards could be used as a guideline for a level 6 programme and/or as a set of
modules that could be integrated in the existing national programmes in a flexible manner, as courses
for mid-level officers, to facilitate the national integration of the common educational standards
developed at European level.
Mid Level Course
To facilitate the national training efforts, Frontex will develop, based on the above mentioned learning
standards, a tailored module / course for Mid Level Officers on selected learning areas covering
European cooperation, Leadership and Management and Fundamental Rights. This course is the
continuation of the well known Mid Level Course (MLC) based on the SQF for Border Guarding and is in
line with the Bologna and Copenhagen process standards that shall be reviewed in 2014 in conjunction
with the previous CCLS for mid level.

European Joint Master’s in Strategic Border Management
The European Joint Degree Study Programme is developed by Frontex in cooperation with the MS/SAC
and will be delivered by a Consortium of BG Academies and Universities in collaboration with other
Page 118 of 135

supporting institutions from the border guard education and training field. The programme will support
a strategic integrated approach to border management and foster a common border guard culture
within EU at higher levels. It will be a professionally oriented masters’ programme where the learning
has a practical application for the border guard organisations which are the ultimate beneficiary. It
aims to promote European harmonisation and the interoperability of border guard activities at all
levels, enhancing cooperation in both operational and training environments.
The Master’s course will address the mid – high level managers working in the border guard field with a
European offer for their professional development which is drawn from the organizational and
operational needs, based on the Sectoral Qualifications Framework for Border Guarding and
Competence Profiles level 7 and designed as an exchange programme (teachers/students exchange).
During the 1.5 years of the programme, the mid-high level managers of the border guard organizations
will have an opportunity to advance best practice in border management by learning together in a
context that reflects the operational realities, reinforcing the European dimension of the border guard
work and the common EU culture. The future students will study each of the 10 modules of 1 week of
intensive study time in a different University. They will also have to complete their dissertation in
their own time, benefitting from rich on-line resources and a virtual learning environment that is
tailored to support and make the learning experience flexible, adapted to the busy schedule of the
learners.
Experienced border guard professionals from all across EU and high profile academics will guide the
students throughout this learning adventure that will start in the fall of 2015. In 2014 it is expected
that the Consortium Agreement is signed and that the programme undergoes the joint European
accreditation/ validation.

SQF for Border Guarding / training Standards in line with Bologna/Copenhagen principles
In 2014, this project is dedicated to support the integration of the SQF and Bologna/Copenhagen
principles in course design and curriculum development by enhancing the training capability and
harmonising the educational standards at European and national level.
The focus of the SQF follow up is on the design and delivery of a Multipliers Course in Course Design in
line with the Bologna/Copenhagen principles in the context of the SQF (designed as a Train-theTrainers concept). The workshop will target the trainers and curriculum design experts nominated by
the MS/SAC as part of Frontex support to the SQF integration at national level. Development of a
supporting course manual is envisaged in 2014 as well.
The national integration of the SQF will be monitored by the SQF Expert Board that will meet once a
year to collect/provide feedback, share experience and best practices and request support as
necessary. This component will serve all the other Frontex training programmes and will ensure the
alignment with the SQF of the common training products developed by Frontex and set the basis for
further certification system.
A panel of Bologna / Copenhagen experts will certify the compliance of Frontex training tools and
courses with the European guidelines which will enable Frontex to offer courses and curricula to the
Member States for national implementation that can be accredited at national level, as well as
meaningful training certificates for the graduates of Frontex courses.

2. Training for Members of the European Border Guard Teams
In order to ensure that the required level of training proficiency for EBGT pool members is achieved,
standard training for EBGT members is delivered. This kind of training activities ensures that officers
deployed to Joint Operations, Pilot Projects or Rapid border interventions have the necessary
knowledge and skills to carry out their assigned duties effectively.
The specialist training offered to EBGT pool members focuses on improving capability; capacity and
performance of explicit groups of EBGT members, deployed to Frontex coordinated joint operations.
Therefore the development of further training tools, EBGT Profile training and knowledge management
is a continuously ongoing process.
EBGT Induction Training
To ensure that every officer participating in Frontex’ operational activities prior to the deployment
receives proper training, the EBGT Induction Training offered in years 2012 – 2013, will be merged in
2014 with the general and the national briefings organized in connection to the deployment. The
content of the briefings will be developed to match the standards of the former EBGT Induction
training.

Profile Training for EBGT members
All guest officers deployed to joint operation shall be members of the EBGT pool nominated for the 13
specialist profiles. The EBGT profiles, as stipulated by the Decision of the Management Board 11/2012,
reflect the typical operational necessities and expertise required for the successful implementation of
joint operations. With the aim of contributing to the creation of an accountable and participatory
EBGT pool that meets the requirements of effective deployment readiness, Frontex develops and
implements training for different profiles.

Profile training for intelligence gathering experts
It includes advanced specialised training courses aimed at so-called “expert profiles” foreseen in the
eligibility criteria for the three profiles:
-

Debriefing Expert’ Training (EBGT profile No 2)
Screening Experts’ Training (EBGT profile No 3)
Second-line Interview Experts’ Training (EBGT profile No 4)

The profile training for intelligence gathering experts is conceived to address the particular
operational needs and matches the expert’s competence requirements with the currently offered
proficiency. This “expert profile” training covers the complete scope of intelligence gathering
expertise facilitates application of best practices for the defined job-competence and could also
inspire implementation of certain profiles on national level.
The curricula and length of the training vary from 5 work days for Screening experts to 8 work days for
Debriefing experts. Every profile training includes practical and theoretical lessons as well as an
evaluation of participants in order to assess their knowledge, attitudes, understanding of practices,
and the capability of their further involvement in Frontex coordinated activities in the respective field.

Page 120 of 135

Profile training for Second-line Airport Officer (Profile No 6)
In the year 2013 Frontex has started the development of new profile training for Second-line Airport
Officers. This training refers to the particular roles, skills, behaviour and attitudes expected from the
experts deployed to the Joint operations related to the Air border.
The Second-line Airport Officers` Training will provide fundamental and most current training
consistent with developing the knowledge, skills and abilities necessary to perform as a Second-line
airport officer.
The Training also aims at challenging stereotypes about work of the deployed Guest Officers, helping
them to interact appropriately and respectfully with passengers. This can enhance civilian trust,
leading to increased operational effectiveness.
The pilot training is foreseen for the 1st quarter of 2014 and after a thorough evaluation, the advanced
trainings for airport officers, who are EBGT members, will be organized.
Taking into consideration the increased need to provide advanced specialised training to EBGT
members, development and piloting of some additional profile training is foreseen for 2014.

Profile training for Border Surveillance Officer (Profile No 9)
New profile trainings for Border Surveillance Officer (Sea/Land) will be developed in 2014. The
mobility and flexibility of border surveillance officers to react lawfully in different typical border
related scenarios and to tackle organized crime by adopting own tactical and behavioural standards,
will play the centre role within the development of this EBGT profile training in 2014. The availability
of a knowledge management system by mobile devices for these officers will be elaborated as a pilot
project.
Those Maritime Border Surveillance officers who may be designated to perform the duties and
responsibilities of a Search and Rescue On-Scene Co-ordinator (OSC) whilst performing border
surveillance tasks during Frontex Coordinated Joint Maritime Operations will be provided with the
knowledge, skills and competences needed for this. This training will mainly focus on the tasks of
staff on sea-going vessels, however due to necessary concerted actions during Search and Rescue (SAR)
missions between vessels and aircraft (Aircraft Co-ordinator/ACO), also air-crew members are targeted
in order to harmonize and improve cooperation.

3. Common Training Standards and Training for Instructors
The specific training activities are designed based on Frontex risk analysis, lessons learnt from Frontex
coordinated Joint Operations and inputs from Member States. The aim is to support the national
implementation of common standards for further training in MS/SAC/PC for Border Guards through the
development of common training tools and qualifying national multipliers.

False Documents Detection Training
The Specialist Course for the Detection of Falsified Documents comprises a two-week course for
document specialists (third line officers) aiming to enhance their knowledge of printing techniques,
common terminology and the examination of questioned documents and their analysis.
Falsified Documents Roadshow is a training activity providing first line border guard officers with
information on national and European level measures regarding the detection of falsified documents.
Advanced Level Training Tool for the Detection of Falsified Documents is the basis for the training of
first and second line officers.
The Basic Level Training Tool for the Detection of Falsified Documents has been developed with a view
to training agents not directly involved in border guard tasks.
The Consular Staff Training is a training activity providing basic training on false documents detection
for Embassy and Consular staff of MS/SAC in Partner Countries.

For 2014 specialist level II course is planned to be developed which will built on existing the Specialist
Course. This course will address experienced specialist level document experts with and officers having
completed the specialist course.

Fundamental Rights and Anti-Trafficking in Human Beings Training
The developed trainers’ manual on Fundamental Rights aims to raise awareness and ensure a
harmonised training of all EU border guards in respecting fundamental rights, aspiring to ever-higher
standards of professionalism as part of an EU border-guard culture. It takes into consideration the
complexity of the duties performed by officials at the border and demonstrates how fundamental
rights permeate and advance their professional lives.
The manual is developed for use by professionals who train border guards. The modern and easy to use
training package is structured on the core functions of the border guards. Frontex facilitates the
implementation of the fundamental rights training on national level by providing expert support and
training of national trainers.
Training of national trainers from EU Member States as well as from Partner Countries, as well as
national training activities for border guards will take place in 2014. Further support for national
trainers will be enhanced with a further development of resources as well as with increased
opportunities for networking.
Frontex has also developed a comprehensive training package to support the Member States in fulfilling
the challenging task of effectively preventing and combating trafficking in human beings. Frontex antitrafficking trainers’ manual is in line with the latest international and European standards, emphasising
that the fundamental rights of the trafficked person are at the centre of all efforts addressing
trafficking in human beings.
National trainers are trained by Frontex based on the methodology of the manual with practical
approach focused on the functions of the border guards. The training package is also made available

Page 122 of 135

to Partner Countries in the interest of developing the integrated border management across all EU
external borders.
In 2014, the implementation of training package in the MS/SAC will continue, and will also begin in the
Partner Countries. An eLearning tool based on the manual will be developed with the main aim to
further support national trainers. It will present the updated information in a user-friendly way and
will contain additional training resources including assessment.

Training and Certification of EUBG Canine Instructors
After the development of the training tools for EUBG dog handlers and EUBG canine instructors,
Frontex Training will continue in 2014 with the 2nd European course for canine instructors (EUBG)
including four modules of two weeks each, this time in the field of product scent (narcotics,
explosives). The course (meant for EUBG canine instructors for product scent detection) aims to build a
pool of elite canine instructors ready to support implementation of Frontex standards in MS/SAC/WAC.
25 instructors will be trained in 2014 and they may be certified - based on evaluation results - as EUBG
canine team instructors.
Certified instructors (EUBG canine team instructors) will support the implementation of the quality
assurance system and the joint certification system with respect to the canine team to be deployed in
joint operations at the external borders of European Union.
Assistance in capacity building will be offered to the states willing to build or to enhance the training
system with respect to service dogs. Fine tuning of already developed training tools will continue in
order to identify an optimal content management system that will facilitate access of instructors to
Frontex training tools.

Training for Schengen Evaluators
The aim of the Training for Schengen Evaluators is to ensure the highest standards of objective
evaluation missions. The course is a one-week training programme for nominated experts from MS/SAC
focusing on how to objectively carry out evaluation missions. The training will take into account the
new Schengen Evaluation mechanism.

Training in the Field of Return Operations
The Standardized training for Escort Leaders of MS/SAC aims at establishing or strengthening their
capacity to organize and implement repatriation flights through safety measures both at the national
level and during Frontex’ coordinated activities, promoting a European border guard culture with high
standards concerning human and fundamental rights and ethics. For 2014 additional training will be
provided based on MS/SAC training needs and Frontex Return Operations Sector operational needs,
making available an adequate number of qualified return officers for national and joined return
operations by air.

The Specialized Course for Escort Officers on Joint Return Operations, designed through a joint effort
of Frontex – EU Member States, Schengen Associated Countries and with the support of UNHCR and
FRA, provides common standards in harmonizing Escort Officers’ Job Competences, therefore focusing
Page 123 of 135

at their common work capability – knowledge, skills and competences needed to enhance the safety
and security of return operations by air organized at National level or coordinated by Frontex.
The training for National Multipliers of MS/SAC aims at qualifying MS/SAC teachers and instructors
(pool of Experts) for the Escort Officers’ training at the National level, on the basis of the curriculum
for Escort Officers on Joint Return Operations.
Following the pilot phase in 2013, it is planned to further continue with the training for National
Multipliers, in 2014, in accordance with EU Member States and Schengen Associated Countries training
related needs.
Ad – Hoc training for certain Partner Countries Return Officers – Escort Teams will be provided in
cooperation with the Frontex Return Operations Sector in the framework of specific Return working
arrangements and based on their training needs to have an adequate number of qualified return
officers available for Frontex coordinated activities - return operations by air.
The courses will follow a blended learning approach, maximising the cost-effective delivery of training
to all those border guards working in the field by making use of Frontex ICT virtual platform (Virtual
Aula).

Language training
Training in English Communication for Border Guards is a tailored training aimed at enhancing language
communication capabilities among MS/SAC border guards working in specific fields of border guarding.
The Training for Practitioners/Language Instructors at airports: basic and advanced level is designed as
a multiplier training in order to reach a large number of border guards working at airports. It enhances
their English knowledge and skills and enable their communication in basic and intermediate English
language as required for performing daily tasks and also for joint operations at airports coordinated by
Frontex.
English Language Tools Roadshow is a training activity performed at airports in cooperation with Local
Border Police Authorities. It provides the first and the second line border guard officers with relevant
information about the common developed English Language Tools and their efficient use for the
improvement of their daily professional performance as well as when covering specific tasks during
joint operations coordinated by the Frontex Air Borders Sector.
For 2014 it is planned to continue with multipliers training for the mid level language tool for border
guards at airports as well as to start with the training of national multipliers for Air and Maritime
crews. These products shall also be adapted to other areas of operation and available as an online
learning though Frontex ICT virtual platform (Virtual Aula).
Roadshows activities will continue in 2014, broaden this approach to the Air and Maritime Basic English
Language Tool as well.

Schengen Borders Code eLearning Tool
The tool simulates an airport border checking point, where the border checks are performed on
passengers entering the Schengen area, in accordance with the Schengen Borders Code.

Page 124 of 135

Following the 2013 testing phase of the developed Pilot application, the fully functional Schengen
Borders Code e Learning tool will be finalised during 2014 and integrated into the Frontex webplatform. The tool will be developed by an expert team and reviewed twice a year with the EU
representatives nominated for the Schengen Border Code eLearning Steering Committee.

4. Training Support Networks and New Solutions for Education and Training
The aim of this programme is:
-

To position Frontex training activities among its key stakeholders and promote long-term
sustainable cooperation in training matters alongside the Stockholm Programme and LETS.
To facilitate the implementation of training products by developing tailored training
methodologies and an IT platform for training, knowledge and learning management.
To initiate the implementation of new approaches for effective training, and to organize short
term projects to stimulate and start up long term development
To establish and carry out mobility/exchange programmes for Border Guards at different levels
(practitioner/student/teacher)
To support the delivery of common standards for further training in MS/SAC/PC by deploying
certified Frontex trainers.

Cooperation with external stakeholders from MS/SAC and Partner Countries is the key to ensuring
adequate implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004 (“Frontex regulation”) in terms of
cooperation with Member States/SAC and Partner Countries. It also follows the orientation set by the
Stockholm Programme and the implementation of the related LETS. For all of the activities mentioned
below, extension of the cooperation with other European Agencies, i.e. those in the field of Law
Enforcement, is envisaged.
National Training Coordinators (NTC) network
NTC network provides Frontex counterparts with formal platform for continuous dialogue on training
matters, it is a forum for the BG relevant representatives to express the national training needs and
formulate proposals for the development and improvement of Frontex training activities, as well as an
important opportunity and “tool” for Frontex to collect these needs and maintain awareness on the MS
interests in the field of BG training.

NTC network enables Frontex to develop a tailored training offer comprising quality training products
which reflect the national needs on one hand and the European dimension of the border management
on the other hand. The NTC platform also offers the Member States the possibility to decide on their
involvement and contribution to the training projects. Moreover, the National Training Coordinators
contribute to all phases of the training development and implementation and their involvement is
essential for a two-way direct communication with all states in training matters.
The involvement of the National Training Coordinators in Frontex training activities is crucial in order
to promote a long-term sustainable cooperation in training matters with the key actors in the field of

Page 125 of 135

training within the border guards’ agencies. At the same time the network should improve the
cooperation among the MS/SAC and Partner Countries.
In total, there are 2-3 conferences/meetings planned for 2014. The Annual Network conference is
scheduled to take place 8-9 October 2014 in Warsaw, Poland.

Frontex Partnership Academies (PA) network
It is a network of national border guard academies from Member States which support Frontex by
hosting Frontex meetings and training activities. The scope of the Partnership Academy Network is
extended towards increasing their involvement and input to training projects. There are 2-3 meetings
planned for 2014. The Annual Network conference is scheduled to take place 8-9 October 2014 in
Warsaw, Poland.

Virtual Aula
Virtual Aula is a web-based platform which offers information about training activities carried out by
Frontex. More than 2000 border guards from 37 states are registered in the network. In order to
increase effectiveness in European training and to advance a common European Border Guard culture,
in 2014 the platform will be extended with eLearning functionalities and features supporting Frontex
operational work. This will ensure that European Border Guards and their national education and
training organisations will have access to Frontex Training courses, tools and other type of resources
relevant for learning and training.
Expert Boards
The Expert Boards represent a platform for training development and implementation. These are
bodies composed of national experts in a specific field, who meet regularly in order to discuss the
latest developments in their respective field in the context of training. The Boards also systematically
review the training programmes and propose further steps for training in the respective field. Expert
boards meetings are financed from the respective projects.
Mobility Exchange programme
In order to support the harmonized implementation of the common standards, Frontex has carried out
the “Erasmus – style exchange” concept – as a solution to promote teachers’ and students’
cooperation, co-operability and information sharing. First phase was implementation of the “teachers’
mobility” system - an instrument to enrich understanding and facilitate reflection on cooperation
needs in Frontex coordinated joint operations. Based on the gained experiences in the Teachers’
Mobility project in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 the concept will be further developed and expanded,
involving teachers’ exchange not only in joint operations but also through active teaching in
partnership academies.
In 2013 the exchange-concept was extended to students’ exchange (mobility). The first phase was the
Frontex coordinated pilot project successfully carried out between the German Federal Police Training
and Further Training Centre and the Romanian Border Police Agents School in Oradea. In 2014, an
exchange between DE and RO will be continued and following the presentation of the pilot results to
NTCs, the other MS will be invited to join the project.

Working arrangements with Partner Countries
Once Frontex has signed a Working Arrangement with a non-member state and the concrete
cooperation plan is established, these Partner Countries will have access to Frontex Training products.
Frontex maintains limited readiness to carry out training projects in non-member states financed from
external sources.

ANNEX 4 – Assessment of Operational Deployment and
Plan of Operational Activities 2014

Annex 4 contains two documents which are provided to the Management Board separately.
The Assessment of Operational Deployment describes the latest trends concerning the irregular
migratory situation (base on information available until mid August 2013). This to identify the border
sections or border areas of the external borders of the EU which are likely to be affected by irregular
migration flows and cross border crime in the near future.
This Assessment of Operational Deployment forms one of the basis on which the more detail Plan of
Operational Activities 2014 was elaborated.
Due to their sensitive content, the disclosure of which would jeopardise and seriously harm the success
of MS driven and supported operational activities coordinated by Frontex, both documents have been
classified as ‘RESTREINT UE’.
To avoid classification of the whole Programm of Work the decision was made to separate the two
documents from the Programme of Work, provide the public version of the Management Summary of
the ‘Assessment of Operational Deployment’ and leave a reference to the ‘Plan of Operations 2014’ as
Annex 4 of the Programme of Work 2014.

Assessment for Operational Deployment – Management Summary

1. Introduction
The aim of this document is to describe the latest trends concerning the irregular migratory situation
from January to mid August 201313. This assessment replaces the Semi Annual Risk Analysis document,
as a part of the new Operational Planning Cycle of the agency, in order to provide the basis for the
drafting of the Plan of Operations for 2014 and the bilateral talks with the national authorities.
The scope of this document is limited to the identification of border sections or border areas of the
external borders of the EU which are likely to be affected by irregular migration flows and cross border
crime. This document is largely based on the data exchanged within the Frontex Risk Analysis Network
(FRAN) covering the first half of 2013 and is also complemented with data gathered through the Joint
Operation Reporting Application (JORA) from the areas of ongoing operational activities coordinated by

13

At the time of writing the latest data available was until 18 August 2013.
Page 128 of 135

Frontex14. In addition, this report also takes into account the Pulsar data set for air borders and main
findings of Frontex strategic reports such as European Document Fraud (EDF), as well as relevant Joint
Operation reports and information collected through operational activities, in particular from
debriefing migrants.
The Risk Analysis Unit at Frontex is constantly monitoring migration trends and should any major
changes occur during the course of the planning and implementation period of operational activities,
these changes would be reported through regular analytical products to MS and to Frontex
management. This allows timely decisions to be made regarding the necessary rearrangement of
resources allocated to operational activities corresponding to operational needs.

2. General Overview of the Situation

Irregular migration
At EU level, in the first half of 2013, detections of illegal border-crossing along the external borders of
the EU totaled 34 500, a level comparable to the first half of 2012 (36 700). However, this relatively
stable situation masked important differences between the first and the second quarters, as well as
differences between routes.
After a record low level in the first quarter of 2013, detections of illegal border-crossing increased
sharply in the second quarter of 2013, because of the resurgence of departures from Libya in the
Central Mediterranean area, as well as a strong increase at the land border between Hungary and
Serbia because of a change in asylum policy in Hungary. This strong increase, one of the sharpest ever
recorded in the FRAN, highlights the rapidly evolving situation at the external borders. By the middle
of August 2013, the number of illegal border-crossings at the sea and land borders totaled nearly
50 000.15
In the Central Mediterranean area, an increase in the number of irregular migrants during the summer
period was expected but the intensification of illegal border-crossings from Northern Africa (Libya and
Egypt) to Lampedusa and other Sicilian Islands have reached a very high level. By the middle of August
around 19 000 irregular migrants were reported in the region, which also includes Malta where 1 500
migrants landed during this period. The figures for the whole region are three time higher than in the
same period of 2012. Most departures took place from Libya where the political situation is still very
volatile and does not enable the authorities to prevent migrants from embarking on the perilous

journey across the Mediterranean Sea. On the contrary there is growing evidence from interviewed
migrants that in Libya, the even representatives of the local authorities are exploiting the vulnerable
situation of the migrants by extorting money or forcing them to work. Several reports also suggest that
local authorities are involved in organising or at least are complacently standing by and permitting
departures across the Mediterranean Sea.
According to Italian intelligence, Libya still hosts a sizeable population of sub-Saharans willing to reach
the EU illegally. Since the end of last year, in addition to nationals from the Horn of Africa, migrants
from the Western African region are increasingly using Libya as a departure country to reach Europe.
Apart from the irregular migratory flow from Lybia there is a growing trend of sea crossings directly
from Turkey and Egypt towards the south Eastern Italian coast of Calabria and Sicily mainly by Egyptian
and Syrian nationals. At the same time secondary migration en route Greece across the Ionian Sea
towards the area of Apulia in Italy has decreased considerably.
Despite the efforts of border control authorities who have already saved many lives in search and
rescue operations the ratio of fatal incidents is the highest in the region, particularly around the
Pelagic Islands. Furthermore reports until mid-August, at the time of writing, confirm a sustained
pressure of irregular migration in the Central Mediterranean area. Reception capacities are strained,
including the capacities to host irregular migrants and the capacities to rapidly assess the request of
those claiming asylum.
The Central Mediterranean also witnessed the arrival of migrants belonging to vulnerable groups. In
particular, there has been a high rate of women and minors from Syria and Egypt targeting the coast of
Calabria and Syracuse, and to a lesser extent, women and minors as part of family groups from the
Horn of Africa in Lampedusa and Sicily.
In the Eastern Mediterranean, detections during the first half of 2013 have remained much lower than
during the same period a year ago before the strengthening of operational measures on the Eastern
Mediterranean route adopted by the Greek and Bulgarian authorities (including Greek operations
Aspida and Xenios Zeus, and operations in Bulgaria as well as Frontex EPN-JO Poseidon Land and EPNJO Poseidon Sea.
From the beginning of January until the middle of August 2013, there were less than 10 000 (compared
to 30 100 for the same period last year) irregular migrants reported using this route, including
detections at the land and sea borders.
The operational measures, mentioned above, also included increasing the capacity of detention
facilities and permitting longer detention periods for irregular migrants at the land borders. This has
led migrants to try to avoid detection and also to seek alternative routes from Turkey, mainly across
the Aegean Sea to the nearest Greek Islands such as Samos and Lesvos, where the detention capacity is
rather limited and where migrants expect the period of detention to be short.

At the same time a partial displacement towards the Bulgarian land border has been observed, as well
as increasing detections of migrants travelling from Turkish airports with forged documents.
The Eastern Mediterranean route is mostly used by migrants, from Syria, Afghanistan, Somalia and
Eritrea transiting though Turkey en route towards Greece or Bulgaria or to other EU Member States.
The decrease is even more remarkable taking into account the volatile situation which prevails in the
Middle East, in particular in Syria.
It is worth noting that the proportion of minors, and amongst them the unaccompanied minors, has
been the highest compared to other regions. This is mainly linked to Syrian nationals, who also have a
high number of women as part of family groups.
There are reports of an increasing number of migrants stranded in Turkey and wishing to enter the EU.
An example of this pressure was revealed in July 2013, with the first detection in Romania on the Black
Sea of two groups of Syrian migrants who had set sail from a small port near Istanbul.
Both Greece and Bulgaria are transit countries rather than destination countries for the majority of the
migrants who either usually continue across the Western Balkans or travel further on intra-EU flights
using false documents.
The increase on the Western Balkan route started in Q1 2013 and was associated with the legal
changes in the asylum policy of Hungary that entered into force in January 2013. From that moment
on, migrants detected crossing the border illegally, immediately applied for asylum and quickly
absconded to continue their travel to other Member States. The number of illegal border crossings by
the end of July 2013 reached almost 14 000 at the Hungarian land border with Serbia. At the same
time, detections of illegal border-crossings from Serbia to neighbouring Croatia and Romania have
dropped. Facing a dramatic increase in migration flow, Hungary amended, as of 1 July 2013, its asylum
legislation, providing grounds for detention of asylum applicants in order to mitigate the scale of the
problem. The impact of this measure has been immediate, particularly in the case of migrants from
the Kosovo region, and detections of illegal border-crossing have quickly fallen. However, the Western
Balkan route remains intensively used for secondary movements of migrants who entered the EU
illegally through Greece.
The issue of Western Balkan migrants massively applying for asylum in Member States continues
unabated, with more than 18 000 applications during the first half of 2013, compared to nearly 13 000
during the first half of 2012. The increase was partly due to the already mentioned change in the
Hungarian asylum policy that led to more than 5 000 persons from Kosovo to apply for asylum. The vast
majority of applications from citizens of Western Balkan countries are considered manifestly
unfounded (in 2012, the rejection rate at EU level for Western Balkan migrants was over 95%)16 and
several Member States have included some of the visa-free countries of the Western Balkans on their

list of safe countries of origin. The Member States most concerned have taken measures to shorten
processing times.
In the Western Mediterranean, the situation remains relatively stable but with diverging trends at the
land (Ceuta and Melilla) and sea borders in Spain. In Melilla, during the months of June and July,
migrants increasingly attempted to cross the fence which separates the Spanish territory from
Morocco; as a consequence the Spanish and Moroccan authorities stepped up surveillance measures. By
contrast, detections at sea decreased because of increased prevention of departures by the Moroccan
authorities. However, the high number of foiled attempts from the Moroccan coast continues to
indicate a high pressure on this route. Irregular migration from Morocco and the Western Sahara to the
Canary Islands has been low because of the continued joint patrols operated by Spain with Morocco,
Mauritania and Senegal.
At the Eastern Land Border, despite the total length of all the border sections, detections tend to be
lower than on other routes possibly because of effective border management by the authorities of the
Russian Federation, Belarus and Ukraine with functioning readmission procedures between them and
the bordering Eastern Member States.
On the other hand, from March to May 2013, there was a sudden and large number of Russian nationals
of Chechen origins refused entry because of a lack of visas at the BCP Terespol railway crossing at the
Polish border with Belarus. Immediately after being refused entry, they applied for asylum in Poland,
but then travelled to Germany where they also applied for asylum. Other Member States, notably
Austria, France, Sweden and Belgium, also reported an increase in asylum applications from Chechen
migrants.
In 2013 the pressure has been high at the air borders in regard to Egyptian, Syrian, Afghan and Iranian
nationals claiming asylum. In regard to statistics the number of asylum claims from 1 January until 18
August 2013 at the EU air borders was 8 364; the top 5 nationalities were from Syria (3203), Egypt
(699), Iran (581), Afghanistan (440) and Pakistan (362). The main affected airports were, in descending
order; Stockholm (ARN), London (LHR), Frankfurt (FRA), Munich (MUC) and Rome (FCO). The trend in
regard to asylum claims has increased since 2012 when the average was about 200 persons per week
while in 2013 this number increased to almost 250 claims per week.
For refusal of entry the total number was 23 177; the top refused nationalities came from Brazil
(1422), the United States (1380), Albania (1357), Nigeria (839) and the Russian Federation (835). The
main airports reporting refusals were Paris (CDG), London (LHR), Madrid (MAD), Rome (FCO) and
Frankfurt (FRA). The top nationalities refused entry in the EU are almost all refused due to lack of
sufficient means (Brazilians) or have no appropriate documentation justifying the purpose and
conditions of stay.

Cross Border Crime
At the EU’s eastern external borders, cigarette smuggling remained the most often reported criminal
activity in the first half of 2013. Recent detections show that some criminal groups involved in this
illicit trade used their illicit proceeds to invest in technical developments such as unmanned rafts using
electronic navigation systems.
At the EU’s external borders to the Western Balkans and also in the Black Sea, a noticeable crimerelated development concerns the trafficking of drugs in particular cocaine. Law enforcement
operations confirm that criminal groups from that region are using their existing smuggling
infrastructure to move gradually into the cocaine trade. Moreover, over the past few years, Albanian
criminals have increasingly being producing cannabis that is smuggled into EU Member States. The
Western Balkan route also connects the heroin trade from mainly Afghanistan to Europe. Migrants
recently interviewed in Greece stated that facilitators forced them to carry drugs with themselves
while crossing the border illegally to Turkey from where the further distribution of the drugs is
arranged by organised crime networks. Drug smuggling is also a common criminal activity and often
mixed with irregular migration in the area of Gibraltar where drugs are smuggled from Morocco to
Spain.
Until the middle of August 2013, MS Authorities detected more than 300 stolen vehicles at the Focal
Points. The highest figures were reported from the Polish-Ukrainian (108) border section, followed the
by Polish-Belarusian (45), border
